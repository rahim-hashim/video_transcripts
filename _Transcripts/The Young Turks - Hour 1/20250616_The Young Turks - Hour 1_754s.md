Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Democratic Lawmaker Dies In 'Politically Motivated' Murder
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI)
*  A moment in this country where we [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=0.0s)]
*  watch violence erupt, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=2.5s)]
*  this cannot be the norm. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=4.4s)]
*  It cannot be the way that we deal [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=7.48s)]
*  with our political differences. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=9.3s)]
*  Now's the time for us to recommit [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  to the core values of this country. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=13.88s)]
*  And each and every one of us can do [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=17.14s)]
*  it, talk to a neighbor rather than [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=18.86s)]
*  arguing, debate an issue, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=20.86s)]
*  shake hands, find common ground. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=22.7s)]
*  Common ground. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=25.2s)]
*  Governor Tim Walsh there at [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=28.68s)]
*  a press conference after the gunman [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=30.32s)]
*  shot and killed Minnesota lawmaker [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=32.32s)]
*  Melissa Portman and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=34.44s)]
*  her husband over the weekend. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=35.72s)]
*  The attack considered a targeted [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  political violence, also the word [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=40.04s)]
*  assassination used by investigators. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=42.28s)]
*  Horrific details emerging on this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=46.0s)]
*  one, Jang, can it be as simple as [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=47.92s)]
*  what Tim Walsh said, what you [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=49.96s)]
*  alluded to in our last story? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  Talking to your fellow neighbors. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=54.08s)]
*  Yeah, well look, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=57.32s)]
*  that's going to work for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=58.04s)]
*  a lot of folks. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=59.08s)]
*  Not going to work for a lot of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  folks, but among the people who I'm [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=60.78s)]
*  worried that it won't work for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  is mass shooters and killers and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=64.36s)]
*  people who have lost touch with [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=66.16s)]
*  reality to the point where they're [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=67.96s)]
*  going to go murder politicians. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=69.92s)]
*  So violence is a form of surrender, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=72.6s)]
*  intellectual surrender. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=74.44s)]
*  It means you're an idiot and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  you don't know how to win [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=77.3s)]
*  an argument, so [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=78.36s)]
*  you just resort to violence. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=79.0s)]
*  That's what this guy did. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=80.6s)]
*  And one of the things we get into [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=82.0s)]
*  right now is also which side is he [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  on? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=86.52s)]
*  Right wing had this preposterous [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  idea that he was a left winger. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=89.6s)]
*  That's not remotely true, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=91.28s)]
*  not 1% true. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=92.88s)]
*  So we'll get into that as well. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=94.64s)]

*  let it go. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=522.92s)]

*  the people inside Israel, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=542.32s)]

*  something terrible, it doesn't [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=552.44s)]

*  Yes, yes, and the people who burned [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=559.28s)]
*  the Teslas were left wing, okay? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=561.08s)]
*  So we got to stop doing this [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=563.04s)]
*  revisionist history and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=564.72s)]

*  I want to blame the other side. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=570.48s)]
*  No, boo, change the facts. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=573.04s)]
*  No, we're not going to change [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=574.84s)]
*  the facts. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=576.16s)]
*  So, but can you stop a guy like [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=576.88s)]
*  this? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=578.84s)]
*  That was your original question, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=579.52s)]
*  Shad. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=581.04s)]

*  very unlikely. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=583.12s)]
*  So real quick on this one, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  let me give you the timeline of [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=586.08s)]
*  what happened. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=587.8000000000001s)]
*  The two people he injured are [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=589.96s)]
*  actually the first people that he [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=591.32s)]
*  went to go see in their house. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=592.9200000000001s)]
*  It was around two o'clock in [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=594.6s)]
*  the morning pretending to be [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=595.84s)]
*  a cop, has a mask on. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=597.08s)]
*  They realize he has a mask on, and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  they start trying to push him out [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=599.8000000000001s)]
*  of the house, and [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=601.48s)]
*  he starts shooting them. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=602.36s)]
*  And he shot both the husband and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=603.88s)]
*  the wife, but they managed to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=605.88s)]
*  escape, and so they did not die. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=607.8000000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=610.36s)]
*  He goes to another legislator's [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=611.12s)]
*  house, they happen to be on [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=612.84s)]
*  vacation, thank God, right? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=614.24s)]
*  Goes to another legislator's house, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=616.0400000000001s)]
*  all Democrats, okay? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=617.88s)]
*  And by that time, the police had [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=619.24s)]
*  gotten the call that the other [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  Democrat politicians had gotten [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=622.48s)]
*  shot, so there was a cop car in [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=624.32s)]
*  front of her house. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  Nice job, police in Minnesota, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=626.84s)]
*  way to go. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  So she's alive because of that, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=629.76s)]
*  okay? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=631.1600000000001s)]
*  He goes to a fourth house, and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=631.84s)]
*  that's where he finally kills [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=632.96s)]
*  the two people. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=633.96s)]
*  And then the police see him doing [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=634.76s)]
*  it, he runs out the back door, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=636.32s)]
*  etc. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=637.6s)]
*  So how do you stop a guy like [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  that? Well, number one, police work [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=639.76s)]
*  in the third case there actually [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=641.28s)]
*  did stop it, so [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=642.88s)]
*  that's why I say terrific job. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  Discredit to the cops when they do [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=645.8000000000001s)]
*  things that are wrong, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=647.48s)]
*  beat up black people for no reason, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=648.84s)]
*  kill black people. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=651.08s)]
*  I said we've gone through all of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=652.84s)]
*  that, when the powerful do [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=654.48s)]
*  something wrong, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=655.84s)]
*  we must call them out. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  When they do something right, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=658.5999999999999s)]
*  credit where credit is due, okay? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=659.88s)]
*  But could cops have stopped [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=661.4799999999999s)]
*  the first one? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=662.52s)]
*  Could they have stopped all of them? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=663.3599999999999s)]
*  No, but if he did not have a gun, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=664.28s)]
*  would it be less likely for [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=666.68s)]
*  him to be able to kill those people? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=668.52s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=670.5999999999999s)]
*  You can say no, no, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=672.2399999999999s)]
*  he could have brought a rope and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  he could have figured out how to [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=674.28s)]
*  tie it and then drag one of them [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=675.4799999999999s)]
*  and then somehow knock out [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=676.92s)]
*  the other one. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=678.2399999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, with a frying pan, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  maybe, right? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=680.88s)]
*  But no, the gun makes it way, way, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  way, way easier. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=683.92s)]
*  So the number one thing you could [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  do is gun control, but this [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=686.5999999999999s)]

*  there'll be these psychopaths and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOhqu1jTxzI&t=692.12s)]
