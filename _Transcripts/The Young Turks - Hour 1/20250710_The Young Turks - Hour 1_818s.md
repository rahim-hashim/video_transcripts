"President Donald Trump sparked a wave of criticism and mockery on Thursday by announcing Nick Adams, best known as a self-proclaimed ‚ÄúAlpha Male‚Äù MAGA influencer, as the U.S. ambassador to Malaysia.
‚ÄúMr. President, thank you for the honor of a lifetime. In your America, all dreams come true. It will be my honor to represent the United States of America in Malaysia,‚Äù Adams said in a clip posted to X on Thursday. ‚ÄúTo the esteemed Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I look forward to a confirmation process that is at the heart of the Constitution that has given me the freedom to pursue the American Dream.‚Äù

# Trump Nominates RIDICULOUS MAGA Troll To Be Ambassador
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g)
*  Hooters is a wonderful family establishment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=0.0s)]
*  Any male that buys a packet of M&M's from today for must hand in their man card [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=5.2s)]
*  because they are a soft, woke, beta male feminist. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=14.32s)]
*  For the last time, stop sending Pizza Hut pizza to my house. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=19.68s)]
*  And if you wanna really know how I feel about the less woke, precious pizza, I'll show you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=26.0s)]
*  I'm off to Hooters with the boys, the boycott stands. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=34.96s)]
*  All right, well those were clips of a man named Nick Adams and you should get to know his name [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=39.28s)]
*  because now he's in our government. So for years, he's bragged about being an alpha male. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=53.64s)]
*  He's complained about woke brands and he has proclaimed his love of Hooters, which I guess [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=58.84s)]
*  they have decent curly fries. Today, thanks to Donald Trump, he is the nominee for the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  ambassador to Malaysia. We have many, many more Nick Adams quotes that I get to read out loud to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  all of you. I can't wait. But first, Cenk, let me get your initial reaction to a troll in our [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=78.92s)]
*  metaphorical dungeon. This guy, I mean, look, you're gonna love the quotes because [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=85.08s)]
*  in a lot of maga things, he's trolling too. He's kind of like a Borat type character. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=93.08s)]
*  But that was all fun and games until he became an ambassador. So he hasn't become one yet, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=99.0s)]
*  but Trump nominated him to be ambassador to Malaysia. This is no full blown idiocracy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=106.44s)]
*  It's starting to peak idiocracy. Trump, he's a troll. He's like a Borat character. He's like [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=113.48s)]
*  Colbert report and they took him seriously. I mean, in fact, we have a poll on tyt.com. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  Is Nick Adams a comic or a joke? Because I think I thought he was a comic. I thought he was making [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=126.44s)]
*  fun of maga. I mean, some of the quotes are over the top and homoerotic. It's hilarious. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=135.32s)]
*  He's now going to represent us as the American representative to Malaysia. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  All right, so find out who Nick Adams is. Okay, yeah, somebody actually made a very apt comparison [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=150.12s)]
*  to somebody else, but we'll get to that in a little bit. So Adams, if you don't know, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=156.68s)]
*  he began his career as the youngest deputy mayor in Australian history. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=161.24s)]
*  But then he left Australian politics and he became a motivational speaker, a conservative [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  activist and a political commentator right here in the United States. And Adams was an early [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump supporter back when Trump was first campaigning and he eventually caught Trump's [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=177.72s)]
*  attention. And the two became friends and it's really a sweet story. But Adams nomination isn't [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  the first time that he has received an official title from Trump. During Trump's first term, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=188.6s)]
*  he made Adams a presidential appointee to the board of a think tank called the Woodrow Wilson [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=193.64s)]
*  Center. Adams was also an official surrogate for Trump's 2020 and 2024 campaigns. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=199.88s)]
*  But we mentioned earlier that we had more Adams quotes. Here they come. So he wrote in 2023, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=206.68s)]
*  I'm a walking, talking masterpiece of masculinity. Testosterone levels spike when I enter a room. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=212.68s)]
*  Everywhere I go, I leave a trail of awestruck admirers in my wake. I don't believe that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=220.36s)]
*  If there's a guy driving next to me in a Lamborghini, I make an effort to not look at them, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=226.84s)]
*  because I'm not going to give you that. So anyways, but that's just me. So the following [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=232.12s)]
*  are some excerpts from a post that Adams wrote in 2024 after then President Joe Biden's State [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=237.0s)]
*  of the Union address. Here's what he said. I was so disgusted by Joe Biden's State of the Union [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=243.08s)]
*  address, I shut it off early and went to the gym for a quick pump to calm myself down. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=248.76s)]
*  I was throwing some heavy weight around when I overheard two attractive college educated [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=254.84s)]
*  Latina career women discussing Biden's speech. So Adams writes that he then went over to talk [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=260.28s)]
*  to both of the women and they admitted that they missed President Trump. So they said, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=267.23999999999995s)]
*  he said, why don't we continue this discussion over here by the bench press? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=273.23999999999995s)]
*  I said with a twinkle in my eye, an alpha male is going to push himself to his limits tonight, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=277.32s)]
*  and he could use a couple of spotters. They looked at each other and blushed before [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=282.76s)]
*  dismounting the treadmill and following me to the bench. We continued our discussion of Trump's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=287.0s)]
*  successful border policies, but I couldn't help but notice that they were ogling my chiseled arms [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=292.12s)]
*  and bulging chest as I powered through four more sets. Adams writes that on his last set, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=297.8s)]
*  he benched 47 reps, setting a new personal best. Then he invited both women back to his place. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=304.92s)]
*  And speaking of his place, in his latest book, Alpha Kings, which is full of advice on how to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=311.96s)]
*  avoid a wife or girlfriend, whoever makes you do anything you don't want to do. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=318.2s)]
*  He describes his house as a wall to wall man cave and declares that he would never compromise his [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  decoration scheme to the taste of any cohabitating woman, except perhaps for a small area for her to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=329.56s)]
*  do her scrap booking or host her sewing machine. You know what? I sew, I have a sewing machine, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=337.16s)]
*  and I gotta say, you need more than a smaller area to sew. You have to have your ironing station [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  and your cutting station and then you're sewing. It's a whole lot. It's a lot of stuff. So Adams, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=348.68s)]
*  as you might have guessed by now, has never been married and he does not have any children. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  Here is the advice that Nick Adams gave a group of young Republican men during a speech in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=359.64000000000004s)]
*  Washington, DC. He said, never apologize, never mask up, never pick up the Fortnite controller. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=364.92s)]
*  It starts with the Fortnite controller and boneless chicken wings and ends up [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  in gender pronouns and communism. We don't want that. So what is the deal with this guy? And is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=376.2s)]
*  Adams sincere or is this a part that he's playing? So to that end, one of Adams security guards [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=383.88s)]
*  told a Washington Post journalist last year, you remember Andy Kaufman? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=391.0s)]
*  All right, we do remember Andy Kaufman and he had a very interesting relationship with reality. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=395.8s)]
*  A longtime friend of Adams told that same journalist, it's not that he's playing a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=400.76s)]
*  character, it's just that he is a character. That doesn't clear up a whole lot. So Trump has [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=405.8s)]
*  released a statement about all of this. Trump wrote on Truth Social, he said, I am pleased to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=412.28s)]
*  announce that Nick Adams will be nominated as the next United States Ambassador to Malaysia. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=419.56s)]
*  Nick is an incredible patriot and very successful entrepreneur whose love of and devotion to our [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=425.24s)]
*  great nation is an inspiration. Nick is a bestselling author, speaker and commentator. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=431.56s)]
*  Nick graduated from the University of Sydney and since then has made it his life's mission [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=437.48s)]
*  to extol the virtues of American greatness. Congratulations, Nick. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=443.16s)]
*  So- And here is how, we have one more though. Let's just see what Nick Adams had to say in his [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=447.56s)]
*  reaction to the news. Receiving the call of duty is the greatest day in the life of any America. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=455.23999999999995s)]
*  Accepting this call of duty should be the easiest decision made by any America. This sacred call [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=464.35999999999996s)]
*  comes to us at different times in our lives and in different ways. It is nothing short of a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=471.0s)]
*  lifetime's honor to take the President's goodwill and spread it to the great people of Malaysia. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=477.16s)]
*  It is, Mr. President, my honor to represent you and serve our nation before King Ibrahim [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=484.76000000000005s)]
*  Iskander and his people. To his majesty, I look forward to working with your government [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=491.32000000000005s)]
*  to strengthen ties between our friendly peoples. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=499.0s)]
*  All right, Cenk, I feel like I need a cigarette after reading all that and I don't smoke. What [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=501.88s)]
*  do you think about all that? I need a vomit bag. So that's why we're asking in the poll on tyt.com, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=509.48s)]
*  comic or joke? Because that's what people are trying to figure out. Andy Kaufman, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=517.72s)]
*  Sasha Baron Cohen, Stephen Colbert, or does he actually mean it? And he's the world's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=522.4399999999999s)]
*  biggest joke. What a doofus. So because guys, wait, we didn't get to the homoerotic stuff, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=528.04s)]
*  so let me give you that. And there's loads of this, if you will. But that might be a second [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=533.24s)]
*  explanation as to why he's not married. No, no, but I'll let you make the call here. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=539.24s)]
*  I'm just gonna give you two for, because we don't have enough time, okay? But he's talking about [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=544.8399999999999s)]
*  playing golf with his buddies and he does this all the time. And then he goes, a foursome with the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=549.16s)]
*  boys will be the most fun you'll ever have in your entire life. And then another time he wrote, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=553.56s)]
*  I love watching Mario handle my meat. And he's constantly talking with these double intandres [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  about golf and he's like, and then my shaft was sharpened by Bob or whatever it was. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm doing that one from every point. So when I read those, those are so over the top, I'm like, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=571.7199999999999s)]
*  I get it, he's a character, right? He's playing a character and at some point he's gonna go, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=577.0s)]
*  haha, mad guy, I trolled you, right? This was an epic lifelong troll and hence the Andy Kaufman [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  reference. But there's some chance he is actually that ridiculous. And that, I mean, really, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=588.52s)]
*  if he's for real, there's a good chance he's gay and has no idea. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=595.88s)]
*  I mean, at night he knows, but during the day, right? He's like, all right, me and the boys [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=600.76s)]
*  are gonna have a force and we're gonna roll around in the grass and the mud and handle [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=606.84s)]
*  each other's shafts. And you see how conservative I am, do I? I'm not sure I do. So is this what you [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=610.84s)]
*  guys are proud of? Come on. So then I wondered, so I did a tweet and I wanted to see Maga's reaction. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  And a bunch of them, of course, were mad at me and like, you don't get it, man, he's awesome or [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=624.76s)]
*  patriot or whatever, right? But then a bunch of them did get it. And I wanna read you one [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=630.36s)]
*  that is a little bit representative. By the way, doesn't represent the majority of the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=635.4s)]
*  Maga guys who replied, but it's just interesting. So this guy, Hibachi Militia wrote it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=640.12s)]
*  I've been wondering why he stopped being funny and became a full-time professional glazer. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, so I think that some portion of the Trump voters and apparently Adams himself [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=650.68s)]
*  began to realize, wait a minute, people are taking this seriously. Maybe I can get something out of [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=658.84s)]
*  this. So then he became in yet another professional ass kisser of Donald Trump. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=663.56s)]
*  And to be fair to him, it worked. If you kiss Trump's ass hard enough and deep enough, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=668.4399999999999s)]
*  you might get that foursome you were looking for with the boys. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=676.1199999999999s)]
*  Hard enough and deep enough, yes, absolutely. It's so bizarre. But I think he said something [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=680.04s)]
*  earlier about this being a lifelong grift. He moved to the United States from Australia. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=687.08s)]
*  But you know what? Maybe it is. I wouldn't be surprised if it was because somebody who [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=694.2800000000001s)]
*  is moving to the United States at that time, right? And says, you know what, I wanna be an [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  influencer. I wanna be famous. I wanna be whatever. That was kind of the way to do it was to become [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=703.96s)]
*  a Maga influencer, right? To be an early adopter of Trump. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=709.48s)]
*  Because at the time, I know it's hard to remember, but back in 2015, Trump was such a ridiculous [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=713.8s)]
*  person, right? Even the idea of Trump as a presidential candidate was ridiculous. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=718.84s)]
*  It was ridiculous all the way up until the point he was our president. Up until the night he became [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=723.48s)]
*  our president, it was a ridiculous thing. So it was easy for people to go viral for saying really [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=728.36s)]
*  supportive things about Trump. Because that was the shock that would get people all the views. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=735.4s)]
*  And it would help them go viral back in the day. And then maybe he just kept riding that wave and [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=742.92s)]
*  couldn't get off it. And why would he? Because now he has a paid gig in Malaysia, good for him. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=747.16s)]
*  I guess he's living his best life. I mean, he's clearly a troll because nobody talks the way that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=753.4799999999999s)]
*  he talks, right? Nobody makes the jokes that he makes in real life. But at the same time, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=758.1999999999999s)]
*  it's like nothing feels real anymore, right? Usually you'd be able to look at somebody like [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=765.4799999999999s)]
*  this and be like, that's a troll. I get it, I know what that is. But today, I feel like everything is [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=772.36s)]
*  so nebulous. The edges are all a little unclear and we see ridiculous people and they turn out [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  to be totally like, I believe these things. So who knows? I don't know what's real anymore. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=785.4s)]
*  No, that's a great way of putting it, guys. I don't know what's real anymore either. The whole [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=791.0s)]
*  thing's surreal. And this is like Biden nominating Borat, like the character Borat, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=794.44s)]
*  to be our ambassador to Kazakhstan. The character Borat to be our ambassador to Kazakhstan. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=802.2800000000001s)]
*  That's the equivalent of this. This is insanity. Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=809.08s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udUOrRkM_2g&t=812.9200000000001s)]
