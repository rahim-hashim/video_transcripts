TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Bernie Catches HEAT For Saying THIS About The Democratic Party
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM)
*  They started to label us the podcast bros and said that we were sexist and we were racist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=0.0s)]
*  and bigoted. It's almost like it's the exact same strategy to get you out of there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And then you got to what we call identity politics. You're black, you're wonderful, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=10.56s)]
*  you're tremendous, you're gay, you're the greatest human being on Earth. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=14.8s)]
*  And rather than say, what do you stand for? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=18.16s)]
*  We felt that over the last four elections, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=22.56s)]
*  Democrats, we felt that we didn't have a say on who could be president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  There hasn't been a fair primary for the Democrats since 2008. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Are they not also a threat to democracy? We often hear. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=34.0s)]
*  Yes, fair enough. This is a good discussion. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=36.48s)]
*  Why are you shocked? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=38.8s)]
*  I'm shocked because I do a lot of hate stuff. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm asking you questions that are not often asked. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=42.8s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders is catching a ton of heat over his views on the Democratic Party's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  treatment of our system of government, democracy, how we run our elections, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=54.48s)]
*  which was the centerpiece, by the way, of the Democrats 2024 election cycle. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  But before we see all of that commentary from [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=64.8s)]
*  Senator Sanders and what the fuss is all about, I do want to just [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=69.92s)]
*  quickly touch on what he had to say about identity politics. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=72.8s)]
*  First, the context though, Cenk, because 2015-2016 Bernie Sanders was very, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=76.8s)]
*  not very, but he was different from 2020 Bernie Sanders. 2020 Bernie Sanders, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=83.28s)]
*  I feel that he felt he had no choice but to infuse his campaign with the identity politics in order to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=90.24s)]
*  keep the identity obsessed off his back when he wants to focus on the bread and butter economic [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=99.76s)]
*  issues that honestly appeals to a much broader base of voters. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=105.6s)]
*  But nonetheless, let's take a look at how that part of the conversation went down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=109.92s)]
*  So we have a question we want to ask about what happened to you in 2016 [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=113.68s)]
*  with this Bernie Bros movement, where your followers are seeing they have a racism problem, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=117.84s)]
*  a misogyny problem. Do you think that's a super PAC thing behind that? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=123.44s)]
*  No, it was the Democratic establishment. During this election, the podcast space, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=126.0s)]
*  which the Democrats largely avoided, they feel had some influence in the election. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=131.44s)]
*  And they started to label us the podcast bros and said that we were sexist and we were racist [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=137.76s)]
*  and bigoted. It's almost like it's the exact same strategy to get you out of there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=145.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's what the liberal elite trying to does. And then you get to what we call [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=149.92s)]
*  identity politics. You're black, you're wonderful, you're tremendous, you're gay, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  you're the greatest human being on earth. And rather than say, what do you stand for? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=164.56s)]
*  Gay, that's fine, who cares? What do you stand for? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=165.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  I love that Senator Sanders focused on the content of someone's character, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=168.48s)]
*  what someone stands for politically speaking, what their objectives are, when they're pursuing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  a position of power. Because that does matter the most, it absolutely matters the most. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=183.12s)]
*  The identity politics situation is so dumb, because what it does is, I mean, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=188.96s)]
*  Woz talks about this so perfectly, I can't articulate it as well as he does. But it just [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=194.72s)]
*  gives you this illusion of actually moving toward progress for marginalized groups of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=201.04s)]
*  people in this country. When in reality, we're talking about elite people who get to enjoy [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=208.72s)]
*  positions of power. But they think exactly the same as the neoliberals, even the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=214.72s)]
*  neoconservatives that have destroyed this country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=220.72s)]
*  Yeah, so this Bernie interview is a Rorschach test and it's a litmus test. So [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  let me explain how it's both. Rorschach and then when you look at it, you can see it depending [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  on your perspective very differently, right? We look at it and we go, that's obviously true, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=235.6s)]
*  right? And thank God he's finally saying it, because we're worried that between 2020 and now, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=240.0s)]
*  he had not been saying it, right? But he's thinking of bolder stance against identity politics [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=244.72s)]
*  and against the Democratic establishment. Now, as a person who's populist left, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=249.6s)]
*  the economic wing of Bernie movement, that to me is perfect. It's mana from heaven, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=255.2s)]
*  But for the establishment, it's very clear. They love identity politics, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=262.08s)]
*  I'm gonna explain in a second why they love it so much. So they hate it, right? I now see [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=265.12s)]
*  the rad libs or whatever they would call it. Yeah, rad libs is perfect, yes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  Right, so those folks who are like, no, Biden's the youngest person in America, he's an infant. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=273.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris is the greatest candidate that's ever happened. She would have 150 states if it [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=278.48s)]
*  wasn't for blah, blah, blah, the rascally kids. And so for those, the crazed Democrats that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=282.32s)]
*  got trained and brainwashed on MSNBC that have now come online, right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=289.6s)]
*  So for those guys, they hate it. They look at the Rorschach test and they go, ugly old woman, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=294.64s)]
*  I don't want it. He criticizing Democrats and our beloved identity politics, I hate that guy, right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=299.6s)]
*  So that's easy. To me, what I'm curious about, and I'm genuinely curious, I don't know, I mean, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=305.92s)]
*  you might have a better sense of it, but we're mainly gonna see it in the reaction going forward, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=310.32s)]
*  right? Is what are our friends on the far left think, right? Because so a lot of them are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=313.68s)]
*  economic populists like us, there's a lot of overlap, right? They should not be pro-establishment. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=319.44s)]
*  I mean, if you're far left, you shouldn't want anything to do with the establishment, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  So but are they so wedded to identity politics that they're gonna join the Radlibs and go, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  no, since Bernie's not doing identity politics, we're out. I don't know, I don't know. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  No, Cenk, I think they're the same people. I think they're the same groups of people, okay? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=341.68s)]
*  So these are individuals. And look, there's the Democratic establishment that has an interest in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=347.2s)]
*  leaning into the identity politics, essentially fracturing the Democratic base based on identity, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=355.12s)]
*  which makes it even more difficult to work together as a broad coalition that pushes for [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=361.92s)]
*  economic prosperity in this country. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  Because think about how things have been playing out over the last decade, for instance, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=369.92s)]
*  On the Democratic side, you have all of these little fractured groups of people, right? You have [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=373.92s)]
*  black people, Latino people, LGBTQ community. And every single one of them [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=380.08s)]
*  has essentially been conditioned to hyper-focus on social policies that specifically apply to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=387.28s)]
*  them and benefit them. And it's not just benefit them as in their group, it's benefit them literally [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=394.56s)]
*  personally, right? So this is not for the masses. This is for among the elites. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=400.88s)]
*  There's a certain number of categories of really good jobs that are gonna get filled. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=407.12s)]
*  That's why you constantly hear about like, well, it's important to have [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=411.52s)]
*  fill in the blank representation. And I could use my own identity, like it's important to have [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=415.76s)]
*  Muslim representation. Now, does that brother go to fight like hell for the Palestinians and make [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=420.0s)]
*  sure that Israel doesn't get any more funding, etc.? Sometimes, and I hope so, and then that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=424.64s)]
*  representation would make a difference. But oftentimes, they don't do that at all, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=429.36s)]
*  whether it's Muslim, black, gay, whatever it might be. They get that position to represent [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=434.0s)]
*  people, then do they? No, do they fight for a higher minimum wage so that you can uplift black [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=438.72s)]
*  and brown communities and all communities across the country? Do they fight for healthcare, etc.? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=443.28s)]
*  No, they leave all of that aside, and they only focus on identity politics. And that is why the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=447.92s)]
*  establishment loves identity politics, because it takes the place of real action. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=453.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  Because if you, so it's a lot of seeming action of like we're fighting them on LGBTQ issues, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=458.79999999999995s)]
*  right? But wait, are you? Because they pass bills all over the country and you really did [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  nothing about it, right? But rhetorically, we are wagging our finger at them. Yes, but did you pass [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=474.0s)]
*  paid family leave to help moms get some time off? No, no, no, we didn't do that. But that's okay, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  because we're American heroes, because we're fighting for these vulnerable communities. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=484.08s)]
*  Right, now look, representation isn't a bad thing necessarily, but when- [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=488.24s)]
*  As long as you actually represent. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  Wait, but hold on, but when representation is literally used as a substitute to passing policies [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=494.08s)]
*  that uplift the very community that individual is representing, what the hell is the point? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=501.2s)]
*  Yeah, so look guys, it's actually super easy to understand when you take out Democrats and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=505.76s)]
*  put in Republicans. So Dr. Oz's Turkish, was I supposed to go, hey, I need Turkish representation [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=510.16s)]
*  in the Senate, right? No, he was a Republican Trump supporter with wacky ideas. So I was [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=516.0s)]
*  against them, even though it would technically get us representation, because he doesn't actually [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  represent Turks in America, right? So now, and Ben Carson and Herman Cain, it said the list goes on. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=527.84s)]
*  Very easy to understand. But when you put in a corporate Democrat who also does nothing for [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=535.36s)]
*  black people, Muslim people, etc., it's gay people, etc., they go, no, no, no, it's okay. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=540.32s)]
*  It's okay. As long as Pete Buttigieg is giving us representation, he doesn't actually have to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=545.44s)]
*  do anything. Yeah, and it's just, it's nefarious in so many different ways. It fractures the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  Democratic coalition based on identity. It makes the coalition, I mean, there isn't a coalition, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  a fractured group of Democratic voters, I guess, who are less willing to work together on a common [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=561.36s)]
*  universal policy or cause that would benefit all of them, right? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=567.12s)]
*  And at the same time, identity politics is used and weaponized as a way of destroying politicians [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=572.24s)]
*  that the Democratic establishment doesn't like, right? So that was what Bernie Sanders was kind [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=579.76s)]
*  of talking about in the last clip that we were watching. But he asks the question, okay, well, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=584.08s)]
*  what do you stand for? And in this next clip, he explains what he stands for. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=589.84s)]
*  So the issue is what you stand for, which gets you back to what we discussed earlier, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=594.0s)]
*  class politics. Yes. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=599.52s)]
*  In the sense of which side are you on? Are you gonna stand with working families? Are you gonna [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=600.72s)]
*  raise the minimum wage to a living wage or not? Are you gonna fight to guarantee healthcare to [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  all people or not? Are you gonna demand that the wealthiest people start paying their fair share of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=614.5600000000001s)]
*  taxes or not? Those are the issues. And no one cares what color you want, what gender is, etc. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=619.52s)]
*  Etc. I mean, that blazer is amazing. Okay. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=624.88s)]
*  It really is. Okay, sorry, that's a side note. No, but these are his values. And they're universal [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=630.4s)]
*  values, or values that would apply universally in the form of policy for the American people [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=637.52s)]
*  to benefit all of us. It's easier to pass universal policies because there's buy-in by [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=643.92s)]
*  various groups of people not based on one identity or the other. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  And it's harder to repeal universal policies like Medicare, like social security. Okay, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=653.04s)]
*  it's harder because everyone pays into it and everyone gets to benefit from it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=660.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So this is now the litmus test because if you look at that and you go, no, Bernie, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=664.8s)]
*  I hate him now. He almost made fun of people in different ethnic groups. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=671.92s)]
*  He's not doing that in any politics. I hate him and I'm not gonna join his class action. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=678.16s)]
*  Okay, well, there we have it. I love that class action. I love uniting us all. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=682.4799999999999s)]
*  I love black people in the movement. I love white people in the movement. I love gay and straight [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=688.8s)]
*  people in the movement. I'm not gonna tell any of them to shut up. I'm not gonna tell any of them [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=692.8s)]
*  that they're inferior. In fact, I'll be livid if anyone says to any of those groups that they are [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=696.4s)]
*  inferior or they need to know their role. None of that's gonna happen. It's not gonna happen [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=702.48s)]
*  against black people. And yes, it's not gonna happen against white people. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=707.12s)]
*  I know on the left, so it's never happened against white people. Okay, whatever. I don't care. Stop [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=710.48s)]
*  dividing us. Stop dividing us, okay? So you're in for that class action that Bernie's talking about [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  or you're not, okay? So make a choice. And again, I know the Radlibs, they're gonna be like, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=724.64s)]
*  no way. And remember, a lot of the Radlibs are rich and they're upper middle class. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=729.6s)]
*  And they don't want things to change. That's why Bernie bothers them more than anybody does. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=734.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=739.1999999999999s)]
*  Because unlike Trump, Bernie means it. So when they see Bernie, it's nails on a chalkboard for [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=739.68s)]
*  them. They're like, he would change my privileged position. Identity politics, identity politics, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=745.28s)]
*  right? So now, but again, for my friends on the far left who we thought we agreed with on [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=750.96s)]
*  98% of issues, I hope you still hold on to your principles that you stated. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=756.96s)]
*  I mean, unless your principles have changed and you don't care about those things anymore [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=763.44s)]
*  and you only care about culture wars, then okay, then that's your call. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So finally, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=770.32s)]
*  let's get to the clip that all the fuss is about. This is what really set the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=772.0s)]
*  Democratic establishment off. Let's take a look. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=776.96s)]
*  We felt that over the last four elections, Democrats, we felt that we didn't have a say [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=779.2800000000001s)]
*  on who could be president. We talk a lot about the Republicans being autocrats and oligarchs [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=787.52s)]
*  and taking over democracy. But from the Democrat perspective, and I'm a lifelong Democrat, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=793.52s)]
*  I felt like the Democratic Party completely removed the Democratic process from its [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=798.96s)]
*  constituents. And I think they need to have some accountability of that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=803.2s)]
*  No argument. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=807.2800000000001s)]
*  I wanted you to, like 2016, I was like, this is gonna happen, this guy's gonna do it. And it [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=808.24s)]
*  felt like they stole it from me. And I'll be honest, it broke my heart when you supported them. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=814.88s)]
*  Ostensibly, there hasn't been a fair primary for the Democrats since 2008. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  Are they not also a threat to democracy? We often hear- [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=824.32s)]
*  Fair enough. That is, yeah, I'm not gonna argue with that point. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=827.2s)]
*  I mean, but where's the lie? They're upset with him. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=831.68s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=838.64s)]
*  Where's the lie? Because if I recall, after Kamala Harris and the Democrats in general were [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=839.28s)]
*  shellacked in the 2024 election cycle, you had a few Democratic lawmakers who were establishment [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=846.7199999999999s)]
*  individuals, by the way, who were willing to come forward, do a little bit of self-reflection. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=853.12s)]
*  And some of them recalled what happened in 2016. And they fully admitted that the Democratic [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=858.0s)]
*  establishment did whatever they needed to do to ensure that Bernie wouldn't be the Democratic [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=863.36s)]
*  nominee. And so where is the lie? Explain that to me. When you have the Democratic establishment [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=868.9599999999999s)]
*  manipulating the primary process in order to ensure their gal is the Democratic nominee, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=874.9599999999999s)]
*  even if they know that the base was far more interested in making Bernie Sanders the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  Democratic nominee. So, and I keep going back to the far left in this case, because there are [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=887.52s)]
*  allies in this fight normally, right? And so I know which side the establishment [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=891.6s)]
*  Democrats are gonna come out on. They're gonna come out 100% against that statement by Bernie. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=898.0s)]
*  And they're gonna say, how dare you? The Democrats are pure as the driven snow. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=902.48s)]
*  They're all angels. And if we just go back to another corporate Democrat, everything will be [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=906.96s)]
*  fine. We'll just go Hillary Clinton 2.0 or Biden 2.0. Everything's gonna be great. Give me Buttigieg's [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=910.8s)]
*  Newsom, we're good, right? Although they're mad at those guys these days too. The Radlibs are mad [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=917.12s)]
*  at everyone. And they make no rhyme or reason. It makes no sense. They're mad at Buttigieg for [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=921.76s)]
*  going on that same show, Flakrant. Andrew Schultz is a lifelong Democrat. How many times does he [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=927.6s)]
*  have to say it, right? No, not good enough, not good enough. We have slight disagreement with [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=933.12s)]
*  beloved Democratic politicians. So those guys are, I love them and I hope they come to their senses. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=937.44s)]
*  I hope they snap out of it and I hope they come and join us. And I think a lot of them will, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=943.6s)]
*  right? But a ton of them will stay in that corner and those will be our opponents in the 2028 [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  primary. Those are gonna be the Buttigieg guys, etc, right? And they're always gonna, corporate's [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=953.12s)]
*  gonna corporate, right? So now, the rest of us have to rally around a populist that takes up [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=959.28s)]
*  Bernie's economic mantle here. And here, in this interview, he's planting the flag and say, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=966.32s)]
*  economic populism. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=971.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=973.04s)]
*  And he's not unclear about it and stop listening to Democratic leadership, which by the way, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm glad he learned that lesson recently, okay? And I love Bernie and I love what he's doing here. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=977.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=983.36s)]
*  And I like that he's come to the right strategy now, as well as the right policies, which he's [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=983.5999999999999s)]
*  always had, right? So I hope our brothers and sisters on the far left go, okay, guys, I hear you. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=989.68s)]
*  We'll pick up the fight later. But in a primary, of course, we're gonna vote with the Bernie side. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=995.76s)]
*  We're not gonna vote with the corporate side. That's my hope. I think that's what's gonna happen. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=1000.32s)]
*  But if that doesn't happen, then we're gonna be fractured and the corporate guys are gonna win. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHhYRL0TXzM&t=1006.0s)]
