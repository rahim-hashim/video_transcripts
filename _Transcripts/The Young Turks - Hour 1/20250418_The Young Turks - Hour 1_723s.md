The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network.

# Bill Burr GOES OFF On Corporate Greed In MUST-SEE Rant
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c)
*  This whole idea that other countries stole our jobs, like our factory jobs and all that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=0.0s)]
*  As far as I remember, that's not the case. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=8.16s)]
*  Bill Burr has been good on a lot of topics having to do with politics for some time, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=10.84s)]
*  but especially ever since Donald Trump got inaugurated, he's like must listen. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=13.88s)]
*  And he decided to do kind of an impromptu history of capitalism, socialism, the labor [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=17.88s)]
*  movement on his podcast. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=23.84s)]
*  And so let's jump into a little bit about the Industrial Revolution, this next clip. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=26.16s)]
*  In the 1800s, during the, what was that period called? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=30.36s)]
*  The Industrial Revolution. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=36.1s)]
*  They had like kids working in factories like in 12, 14 hour days, like four, five year [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=38.44s)]
*  old kids in dangerous situations. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=43.2s)]
*  And people weren't making any money and the one guy who owned the factory was keeping [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=46.84s)]
*  all the money. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=50.04s)]
*  The working man finally has enough. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=51.04s)]
*  They start organizing unions. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=53.56s)]
*  The robber barons hire police, the army, all of these people to come in and kill these [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=56.0s)]
*  people in riots. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=60.96s)]
*  Crack their skulls, do unbelievable sorts of damage to them to try and force them to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  go back to work for sweatshop wages. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=69.80000000000001s)]
*  These people died, were maimed, catastrophic injuries so that we could have a decent wage [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=73.84s)]
*  in this country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=82.36s)]
*  And they had unions and all of that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=83.4s)]
*  All of what he's saying there is true and we'll have more from him. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=85.56s)]
*  And it is such a massive, I don't know, shame, feels a kind of a crime that after all that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=88.84s)]
*  was done over the course of decades and decades to achieve all these amazing wins and to give [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=95.56s)]
*  us the life that we have right now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=100.24s)]
*  Most people have now been propagandized too for a couple decades and they despise unions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=103.48s)]
*  They think that they're wasteful at best, corrupt, criminal, shouldn't be a part of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=108.12s)]
*  them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=111.8s)]
*  In fact, a populist Republican movement should probably kill unions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=112.8s)]
*  That's unfortunate. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  And before we discuss, I do just want to dive into one thing that he talked about there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  He talked about kids working in factories and things like that back in this prior movement. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=122.56s)]
*  Well, get ready for that because we're already seeing it in multiple states, including just [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=127.36s)]
*  last month, Florida was debating lifting some child labor laws to fill jobs vacated by undocumented [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=132.0s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=138.56s)]
*  Remember the jobs that undocumented immigrants took from good working adult Americans, except [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=139.96s)]
*  maybe not. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=146.88s)]
*  And we do still need those workers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=148.36s)]
*  And so I guess we're just gonna try to flood the labor market with cheap kids, I guess, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=150.7s)]
*  that won't be protected. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=155.44s)]
*  That way we don't have to pay adults higher wages because it's more competitive. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=156.52s)]
*  The entire thing is so nonsensical. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=160.36s)]
*  But I do think it's a great time, Cenk, for this history lesson because this seems to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=162.08s)]
*  be that period of time seems to be the model that Donald Trump and Elon Musk want to take [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=166.56s)]
*  us back to. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=170.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think the part of the propaganda that bothers me the most is when people talk about [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=171.28s)]
*  corporations like they're humans. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=177.52s)]
*  As Mitt Romney famously said, corporations are people, my friend. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=180.76s)]
*  And of course, the Supreme Court said that in decisions of 76, 78, and then in Citizens [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=185.88s)]
*  United. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=191.4s)]
*  And so then they have these absurd conversations about, well, are American companies gonna [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=192.4s)]
*  be patriotic? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=199.8s)]
*  Are they gonna do their duty? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=200.8s)]
*  And they're not gonna do any of that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  They're gonna maximize profit. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=204.56s)]
*  We wrote the code. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  I think we made a mistake. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=207.68s)]
*  Other countries have written slightly different codes and that have gotten to better results. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=208.96s)]
*  And we had one line in the code, maximize profit. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=213.76s)]
*  And that has led to them to doing all of these horrible things. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  So it's basically like a robot. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=221.12s)]
*  People keep talking about, my God, what if the robots took over? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=224.0s)]
*  Too late, they already took over. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  Those are corporate robots and we program to maximize profit at our expense. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=230.28s)]
*  And they've been doing it now for a long, long time. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=235.84s)]
*  So yes, when they began the union movement, as Bill Burr is referring to, and they decided, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=238.44s)]
*  hey, if we pull ourselves together here, we'll actually begin to have leverage. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=243.08s)]
*  Otherwise they can fire us one by one. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=249.32s)]
*  And they were right, and that leverage helped to get higher wages and corporations despised [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=251.38s)]
*  it cuz it was higher cost for them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=256.08s)]
*  So for a while they tried to break the unions and they literally murdered people as Bill [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=258.52s)]
*  Burr is referring to, the Pinkertons, etc. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=262.7s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=265.92s)]
*  Cuz the only code was maximize profit. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=266.92s)]
*  Morality be damned, community be damned, we're workers be damned, this country be damned. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=270.52s)]
*  So then they moved on to phase two. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=276.76s)]
*  So they said, all right, well, if you guys are gonna protect the average American, we're [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=278.64s)]
*  gonna go to a country that doesn't protect the citizens. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=282.44s)]
*  We're gonna go to China, we're gonna go to Vietnam, etc. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=285.2s)]
*  We're gonna find the lowest wages. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=287.2s)]
*  These things are inevitable if you say the only rule you have is maximize profit. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=289.24s)]
*  Those corporate machines will roll over all of us, the entire globe, and that's exactly [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=296.68s)]
*  what's happened. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=302.0s)]
*  So now that we've outsourced a lot of the jobs, but then we still need labor here cuz [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  we have good unemployment numbers. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  But our wages have been stagnant since those Supreme Court decisions in 1976 and 78. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=310.68s)]
*  And that's not an accident. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=316.68s)]
*  And I talk about that in my book, Justice is Coming. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=318.16s)]
*  That's actually the single most important rule change that there was. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=320.68s)]
*  The activist justices on the Supreme Court said corporations are human beings. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=324.16s)]
*  They have speech rights and money of speech so they could buy all of our politicians, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=328.56s)]
*  unlimited bribery. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  And that is what ruined this country. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  And now that they're kicking out more undocumented immigrants, they're saying, well, we need [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  child labor back. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=343.64000000000004s)]
*  Because under no circumstances are these corporate machines going to serve you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=345.32s)]
*  We didn't write the code to serve us. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=350.72s)]
*  We wrote the code to exploit us and to crush us so that they could make more money. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=352.92s)]
*  We have to change the laws. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=358.88s)]
*  Otherwise, this is going to happen for the rest of time. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=360.68s)]
*  Yeah, we always have to look at levers of power and counter power and [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=363.72s)]
*  ways to establish leverage over forces that are disenfranchising and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  exploiting so many people. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=373.36s)]
*  As we're looking at the insanity of these tariffs and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=375.56s)]
*  the kind of volatility it's presenting to so [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=379.8s)]
*  many people's lives, including people's 401Ks. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a reminder of an era that Trump worships that he discusses now. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=387.76s)]
*  He didn't discuss it as much back in the 2016 days, but [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=392.8s)]
*  he did talk about tariffs, which is the Gilded Age, right? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=395.6s)]
*  And so sometimes I'm doing nice fun things in the evening to kind of lift my spirits. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  But sometimes I'm doing things like watching documentaries about the Gilded Age. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=403.48s)]
*  Don't ask me why, but that's me, a glutton. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=406.72s)]
*  So what's very notable about the Gilded Age is there was a few [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  robber barons that were able to exploit the technologies of that time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=416.08000000000004s)]
*  To reap and gain all the benefits while obviously disenfranchising and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=423.0s)]
*  screwing over workers and the wider public, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=427.88s)]
*  And so I think that is uncannily similar to what is occurring now. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=432.0s)]
*  And as you mentioned, Cenk, it's about taking all the profit and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=436.56s)]
*  making all the money. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  In particular case of today when it comes to tech and kind of the doging of our [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=441.92s)]
*  lives and all this doge stuff, it's actually not even always about profit. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=445.88s)]
*  It's sort of more of a feudal system. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  And it's a system of amassing massive, massive valuations, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=454.36s)]
*  A company like Amazon, for example, was not profitable for [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=458.92s)]
*  the first decade or so of its existence. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  Uber wasn't either. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  But in the meantime, they knocked out all worker organizing, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=465.08000000000004s)]
*  knocked out all the competition, essentially became close to de facto [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  monopolies, and then basically could do whatever they wanted at that point, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  including hijacking markets and so on. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=476.0s)]
*  So it's a reminder, this story and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=478.28s)]
*  Bill Burr's warnings that greed begets greed, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=483.28s)]
*  as we've talked about before. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=488.08s)]
*  Or even a reminder of Gordon Gekko, if you all remember Wall Street, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=490.64s)]
*  greed is good. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=495.11999999999995s)]
*  Somehow there is this sort of vision that is out there. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=496.23999999999995s)]
*  But what the vision is of an economic future for this country and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=500.2s)]
*  this planet is completely under articulated. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=504.11999999999995s)]
*  And we need a progressive response that discusses what our vision is [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=507.56s)]
*  of an economic future. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=511.96s)]
*  It's good stuff, listen to this on corporate greed. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=513.32s)]
*  Eventually, these corporations just got sick of dealing with these unions. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=515.56s)]
*  And they're hard nosed negotiating all that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=520.92s)]
*  And then they just said, well, you then, keep your union, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=522.96s)]
*  keep your factory, we're leaving. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=526.56s)]
*  And they took their factories outside of the US and went back to 1800 wages. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=529.08s)]
*  What the you should be making those things here. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=534.8s)]
*  And then what the corporate guy said was, well, we would make sneakers here. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=538.04s)]
*  But to pay the American worker and everything, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=543.04s)]
*  the sneakers would then instead of costing 50 bucks, they now cost 700. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=545.96s)]
*  And I was always thinking, why? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=551.72s)]
*  It would cost 700, but I can't afford that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=555.4s)]
*  And what it really was, was they weren't going to lose the profit [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=558.36s)]
*  of sweatshop labor. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=562.08s)]
*  So if they came back to America, we weren't going to work for that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=563.2s)]
*  So and they weren't going to lose the profit of sweatshop labor, so [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=568.08s)]
*  they were going to pass it on to the consumer. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that was the argument. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=575.8000000000001s)]
*  We hear sort of updated versions of that now. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=577.72s)]
*  Jen, any quick thoughts about that? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=579.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they always have an excuse for getting more and more profits from us. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=581.72s)]
*  We'll hold all your prices hostage, and we'll do this and that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  So each industry is different, and we might have lost some industries. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=591.28s)]
*  I understand that, right? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=595.12s)]
*  But there's a lot of industries we could have protected. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=596.52s)]
*  And more important than anything else, look guys, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=598.8399999999999s)]
*  our government was supposed to be a democracy. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=602.6s)]
*  I wrote about this in Justice Coming 2. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=605.3199999999999s)]
*  And our founding fathers warned us about corporations. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=607.6s)]
*  They partly did the American Revolution against the British East India Company. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=612.48s)]
*  The Tea Party, where they threw the tea overboard, was against that corporation, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  not against the British Empire, okay? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=622.88s)]
*  And they heavily, heavily warned, and I've got some of the quotes in the book, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=625.4s)]
*  do not let corporations take over. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=629.1199999999999s)]
*  And we didn't listen, and slowly they took over. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=632.0s)]
*  And now we're at a point where they threaten us every once in a while, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=635.2399999999999s)]
*  you don't listen to us. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=638.8399999999999s)]
*  You'll have to pay $700 for your sneakers, okay? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=639.9599999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=643.04s)]
*  We're going to use your children. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=643.5999999999999s)]
*  We're going to put them, and you know that law in Florida, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=644.68s)]
*  that isn't just like, God, I'm having a summer job at Burger King. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=646.84s)]
*  No, it's to let kids work the overnight shift during school days. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=650.44s)]
*  I mean, it is exploitation on steroids, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=658.2s)]
*  because our government doesn't work for us. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=662.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what populism is, saying, get the government to work for the people again. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=666.64s)]
*  Turn it back into a democracy, and not have it serve the donor class and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=671.64s)]
*  corporate rule. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=676.48s)]
*  And so that's basically what Bill Burr is pointing out there. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=677.76s)]
*  He's absolutely right. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  One of our members wrote in, everybody's asking for Joe Rogan of the left. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=682.24s)]
*  I mean, Bill Burr is amazing, and it isn't about left or right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=686.4s)]
*  It's common sense, and it's fighting for the average guy. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=690.64s)]
*  I mean, so my last point to you guys is, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=693.96s)]
*  do not let corporate media brainwash you into believing [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=698.36s)]
*  any of this corporate propaganda. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=703.44s)]
*  They do not have to rule us, and we don't have to pay their ransom. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=705.28s)]
*  We can actually take our government back and reset it to serve us rather than them. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=710.56s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=716.36s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1qLTiIKf7c&t=719.4399999999999s)]
