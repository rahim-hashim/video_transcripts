"Oil prices rose moderately as the market opened on Sunday evening, a sign that traders are concerned, though not panicked, about how Iran may respond to the U.S. bombing of its nuclear facilities over the weekend.
The increase of around 3 percent left U.S. oil prices hovering around $76 a barrel. That is notably higher than prices were two weeks ago, before Israel struck Iran, but still tame by recent standards."

# Iran War Could EXPLODE Gas Prices
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw)
*  Iran's parliament voting in favor of closing a major shipping route, putting as much as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=0.0s)]
*  one fifth of the world's oil supply at risk. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=5.16s)]
*  It could cost suppliers big time as Forbes finds that roughly $1 billion worth of oil [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=8.22s)]
*  flows through the Strait of Hormuz daily. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=13.94s)]
*  As of this moment, President Donald Trump has announced that Israel and Iran have agreed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=17.38s)]
*  to a ceasefire. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=22.12s)]
*  We're gonna have to wait and see if that's actually true and if both parties abide by [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=23.12s)]
*  said ceasefire. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=28.96s)]
*  But in the meantime, war with Iran has already had an impact on the price of oil. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=29.96s)]
*  And as you heard in that video from Fox News, the Iranian parliament has already voted in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=36.36s)]
*  favor of shutting down the Strait of Hormuz where there's quite a bit of oil being transported. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=41.84s)]
*  Because Iran, of course, is an oil producing country. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=48.24s)]
*  In fact, around a fifth of the world's oil and related products flow through the Strait [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=50.96s)]
*  of Hormuz each day, according to the US Energy Information Administration. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=56.42s)]
*  A similar share of liquefied natural gas that has been cooled for shipment also makes the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  journey. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=68.22s)]
*  Now, more than 80% of those fuels go to Asia. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=69.22s)]
*  China is a huge buyer of Iranian fuel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  And so closing the Strait of Hormuz could mean that 17 billion barrels of oil could [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=76.7s)]
*  be removed from the global markets. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=82.7s)]
*  And these Asian countries, China being one of them, would look to purchase oil from other [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=85.5s)]
*  oil producing countries in the global market. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=90.3s)]
*  And that means limited supply, higher demand, that's going to increase oil prices. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=93.58s)]
*  So the war is already increasing energy costs for consumers in the United States. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=99.54s)]
*  The price of a gallon of regular gasoline climbed to nearly 3% last week to $3.22, and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  that's according to the AAA Motor Club. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=109.82s)]
*  And according to the Wall Street Journal today, prices were below $70 a barrel before Israel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=113.1s)]
*  struck Iran this month. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=118.74s)]
*  Brent crude, the international benchmark, spiked above $81 a barrel before falling back [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=120.74s)]
*  to trade around 0.6% higher at about $77.50 recently. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  WTI, the US equivalent, rose a similar amount to slightly over $74 a barrel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=132.26s)]
*  So hopefully the ceasefire is real. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=140.06s)]
*  We avoid getting dragged into a regime change war in Iran. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  I've learned to not be as optimistic and hopeful as I would like to be, but we're just going [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=147.26s)]
*  to have to wait and see. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=152.06s)]
*  Cenk, thoughts? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=153.06s)]
*  Yeah, so they think they've got Iran cornered because their most effective attack would [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=154.06s)]
*  be against the Strait of Hormuz and blocking it off and causing the economic damage that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=158.12s)]
*  Anna talked about. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=163.1s)]
*  But it would affect a lot of their allies, which would then be angry with Iran. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=164.1s)]
*  For example, China has been saying, hey, this was a terrible and illegal attack by [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=169.22s)]
*  America on Iran. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=174.1s)]
*  But if you cut off the oil to China, then they might be aggrieved by that and then you're [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=176.02s)]
*  in a tough spot. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=180.82s)]
*  But most of all, that's where most of Iran's oil goes through, so that would cost themselves [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=181.94s)]
*  a ton of money. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  So we are assuming that they won't do that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=187.9s)]
*  I didn't think that is a wrong assumption for reasons that I'm going to explain to you [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=190.02s)]
*  in a second. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=193.82s)]
*  So far, by the way, the oil price is 3% change is not that big a deal. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=194.82s)]
*  And so, so far not that bad. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=198.54s)]
*  And the markets are reacting like they think that this is not going to be a big deal and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=201.73999999999998s)]
*  it's not really a big war. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=208.1s)]
*  The markets went up today, they didn't even go down, okay? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=209.5s)]
*  So I think they're wrong. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=212.62s)]
*  And so it'll be interesting again here to say, I'm saying that I think the entire market [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=214.5s)]
*  is wrong. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  So we'll see about that, that's a bold comment, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=219.73999999999998s)]
*  But why do I say that? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=222.73999999999998s)]
*  Because I've never seen Israel be satisfied with enough war. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=223.98000000000002s)]
*  So Trump says it'll be all over in 24 hours. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  My guess is Israel will find a way to say, no, Iran violated the deal, so we have to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=233.06s)]
*  go back. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they're not going to say, we violated the deal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=240.26000000000002s)]
*  When in reality, it's almost every single time Israel breaks a ceasefire. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=242.74s)]
*  Whether it's Gaza, whether it's Iran, whether it's anyone else. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, now us too. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=253.02s)]
*  We say, yeah, we're going to give you two weeks, just kidding. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=254.3s)]
*  We were giant liars and we just bombed the living crap out of you. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=256.42s)]
*  So my guess is Israel agitated, agitate until they get a bigger war. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=261.58s)]
*  And then the markets go, I can't believe that happened. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  And when you say regime changes, Trump did just yesterday, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=269.82s)]
*  You give the Ayatollah no other out. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=274.7s)]
*  He thinks, all right, then I guess I'm a dead man anyway. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=277.1s)]
*  So I have no reason for restraint anymore. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=280.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=282.58s)]
*  So, and this ceasefire might be a ruse because they got word that Iran is planning to do [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=283.58s)]
*  something in the next 24 hours. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=288.58s)]
*  And it's just to slow them down. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=290.7s)]
*  Or if Iran does do it, they go see they violated the ceasefire. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=292.7s)]
*  But I would be shocked if it held, because like I said, I've never seen Israel satisfied [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  with peace. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  They always want more war. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=303.94s)]
*  Yes, and just to give you guys the statement from Trump over the weekend that hinted at [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=306.02s)]
*  his consideration of engaging in a regime change war in Iran. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=310.82s)]
*  He wrote that regime change has quickly become, that's actually from Charlie Kirk. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  This is Trump's comment. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=322.09999999999997s)]
*  He says, it's not politically correct to use the term regime change. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=323.21999999999997s)]
*  But if the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn't there [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=327.1s)]
*  be a regime change? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=331.74s)]
*  Listen, the people of Iran should pursue that regime change on their own. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=334.18s)]
*  It is not the place of the United States and certainly not the place of Israel to go in [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=340.1s)]
*  there and do a regime change war on their behalf. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=344.56s)]
*  So Israel can install some sort of puppet for their government. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=347.74s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=352.1s)]
*  Yeah, it reminds me of when they said about Iraq that we're going to be greeted as liberators. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=353.1s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, exactly. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=357.70000000000005s)]
*  Were we greeted as liberators? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=359.86s)]
*  So guys, it's the same exact playbook. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=361.70000000000005s)]
*  They're being lazy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=365.26000000000005s)]
*  The reason they're being lazy is that we have American media 100% in our pocket. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=366.3s)]
*  We have US Congress nearly 100% in our pocket. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=370.18s)]
*  We had Biden in our pocket. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=373.06s)]
*  We have Trump in our pocket. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=374.14s)]
*  So we could just tell people the same exact lies we told them last time. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=375.5s)]
*  WMD, we're not done yet. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=379.42s)]
*  They moved the WMD. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=381.82s)]
*  We have to keep going. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=383.42s)]
*  Now it's regime change. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=384.42s)]
*  They were the aggressors. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  They're the violent terrorists. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=387.94s)]
*  We're the ones that are doing defending ourselves. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=389.58s)]
*  It's all the same lies, 24 seven. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  So look, I think that if Iran gets to a situation where they think, okay, all hope is lost, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=394.66s)]
*  and we're not going to be able to prevent this war, they're going to switch to, okay, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=404.22s)]
*  now let's have a real war. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=409.06s)]
*  And I hope that never comes. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=410.74s)]
*  But if it does, I'd be shocked if they didn't block the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=412.1s)]
*  I mean, they'd be kind of nuts not to. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=416.74s)]
*  That's their one go to move. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=419.66s)]
*  And by how much we're howling ahead of time, we're accidentally tipping off that that's [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=421.94s)]
*  the thing that we care most about. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=428.82s)]
*  Every press report's like, well, they better not take out the Strait of Hormuz, because [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=431.3s)]
*  that would hurt them more than anything else. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=435.58s)]
*  And they better remember that, okay? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=437.38s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, so you're super panicked about the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=438.78s)]
*  So with that kind of obvious concern, it'd be nuts if Iran didn't bomb that, if we're [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=443.14s)]
*  in the middle of a real war, etc. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=449.98s)]
*  And by the way, I don't know, Iran might have terrible capabilities left. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=451.82s)]
*  They might not have much capabilities at all, or they might have a lot more capabilities [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=455.26s)]
*  than we realize. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=459.5s)]
*  That's the risk of war. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=460.85999999999996s)]
*  You don't know what's going to happen next. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=462.53999999999996s)]
*  Can their drones take out our ships? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=464.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't know, nobody's ever attacked a ship with drones before, right? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=466.46s)]
*  If they're sitting there as once the Strait is blocked, and they can't, especially if [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=470.26s)]
*  we have any in the Persian Gulf, and they can't leave, you could just endlessly attack [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=474.26s)]
*  that ship. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=478.38s)]
*  So we'll see, we'll see. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=479.97999999999996s)]
*  I hope none of it happens and the ceasefire holds. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=481.53999999999996s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=484.94s)]
*  But look, if a war with Iran does happen, if the US gets dragged into it, and it's a [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=485.94s)]
*  prolonged regime change war on behalf of Israel, I'm sure we'll all feel super relieved that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=491.34s)]
*  Republicans are cutting nearly a trillion dollars in funding for Medicaid so we can [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=499.17999999999995s)]
*  pay for this war. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=503.26s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=504.62s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8BIBW9xWjw&t=507.58s)]
