"Donald Trump‚Äôs mass deportation efforts, which have skirted numerous laws and denied due process to immigrants, are very unpopular with the American people. 

A new poll from YouGov states that 60 percent of respondents oppose deporting immigrants without criminal convictions to El Salvador without them having a chance to challenge their deportation in court, and 46 percent strongly oppose it. But the opposition to Trump‚Äôs El Salvador plan breaks down on party lines: 89 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of independents oppose it, while just 34 percent of Republicans do. "

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Americans Are NOT COOL With Deporting People Without Due Process
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk)
*  You can't take away people's due [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=0.0s)]
*  process like that. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=2.36s)]
*  And again, I don't trust the El [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  Salvadorian government to be [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=5.68s)]
*  making sure that they're not [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=7.84s)]
*  torturing people, that they're [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  vetting them properly. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=11.88s)]
*  They need to be vetted on this [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=13.46s)]
*  side. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=14.74s)]
*  Democrats always say this could [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=15.24s)]
*  happen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=16.68s)]
*  It did happen. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=17.18s)]
*  It didn't could happen. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=17.88s)]
*  It did. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  They're torturing them? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  Did you watch the video? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=20.68s)]
*  I don't think she did because [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=23.88s)]
*  Jessica Tarloff is absolutely right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=25.66s)]
*  It did happen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=28.5s)]
*  Unfortunately, we're seeing more [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=29.4s)]
*  and more stories involving [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=31.299999999999997s)]
*  individuals who were actually in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=32.74s)]
*  the United States legally, were not [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=34.6s)]
*  part of any type of Venezuelan gang. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=36.74s)]
*  But unfortunately, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=40.22s)]
*  we're rounded up by ICE and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=41.82s)]
*  sent to a terrorist detention [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=43.72s)]
*  facility that also, by the way, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  imprisons hardened criminals and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=48.28s)]
*  gang members in El Salvador. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=50.5s)]
*  It's known as CICOT. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=52.86s)]
*  We've been talking about it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=53.66s)]
*  But there's actually a little bit [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=54.7s)]
*  of good news today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=56.58s)]
*  Because I always want to know where [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=58.1s)]
*  do the majority of Americans stand [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=60.0s)]
*  on this issue? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=61.92s)]
*  Now Trump is still polling well on [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=63.22s)]
*  immigration. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=65.12s)]
*  It's actually the one area where he [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  is not underwater. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=68.12s)]
*  53% of Americans, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=69.24s)]
*  according to a recent CBS poll, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=70.64s)]
*  are still liking what Trump is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=72.72s)]
*  doing in regard to immigration. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=74.62s)]
*  But those numbers could really take [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=76.6s)]
*  a hit. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  And this should be a warning to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=80.16s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=81.9s)]
*  This poll result should be a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=82.44s)]
*  warning to Trump. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=83.68s)]
*  Because according to a new poll [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=84.6s)]
*  that was just put out by YouGov, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=86.48s)]
*  it seems that most Americans [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=88.66s)]
*  actually agree with Fox News host [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Jessica Darlov and believe that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=92.56s)]
*  deporting migrants without due [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=94.72s)]
*  process should not be allowed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=96.82s)]
*  And by the way, according to our [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=99.12s)]
*  Supreme Court on multiple occasions, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=101.08s)]
*  it isn't allowed, okay? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=103.52s)]
*  Even people who are in the country [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=106.32s)]
*  illegally are protected by our [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  constitutional rights, including [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=110.52s)]
*  the right to due process. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  But the people we're talking about [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=114.4s)]
*  in the country illegally, but [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=117.04s)]
*  they got rounded up by ICE anyway. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=118.4s)]
*  Anyway, so the poll was conducted [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=120.08s)]
*  between March 28th and April 1st. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=122.24s)]
*  And here's what they found. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=124.88s)]
*  Deporting immigrants without [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=126.56s)]
*  criminal convictions to El [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=128.52s)]
*  Salvador to be imprisoned without [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=130.22s)]
*  letting them challenge the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=132.28s)]
*  deportation in court. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=133.84s)]
*  That was what the basis of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=135.4s)]
*  the survey was about, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=137.2s)]
*  And here are the results. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=139.6s)]
*  Only 15% of these respondents said [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=140.48s)]
*  that they strongly support and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  11% say they somewhat support for [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=145.22s)]
*  a total of 26% supporting the move [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=147.82s)]
*  by the Trump administration to some [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=150.58s)]
*  degree. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  26% is still a little too high in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=154.66s)]
*  my eyes, but it's minuscule. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=157.38s)]
*  It's minuscule when you think about [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=159.94s)]
*  how things seem online versus how [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=162.5s)]
*  most Americans are feeling. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=164.9s)]
*  Most Americans want due process, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=167.18s)]
*  because I'm going to assume they're [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=169.46s)]
*  smart enough to understand, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=171.86s)]
*  it is the moral thing to do. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=173.9s)]
*  It's the ethical thing to do, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  the constitutional thing to do. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=177.22000000000003s)]
*  But more importantly, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=178.78s)]
*  when you start cheerleading for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=180.82000000000002s)]
*  the erosion of rights for others, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=183.5s)]
*  you would be mistaken to think that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=186.26000000000002s)]
*  it's not going to come back to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=188.86s)]
*  haunt you or someone you love, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=191.06s)]
*  someone you know. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  You have to protect due process. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=194.9s)]
*  These types of rights help set [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=197.9s)]
*  countries like the United States [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  apart from other countries that we [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=202.82s)]
*  do not in any way favor wouldn't [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=205.38s)]
*  want to live in because there's too [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  much government power and people [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=210.34s)]
*  don't have the right to defend [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=212.62s)]
*  themselves when they're accused of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=214.7s)]
*  something they maybe didn't do, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=217.22s)]
*  right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=219.74s)]
*  So in the case of these migrants, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=220.34s)]
*  we're talking about one guy who was [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=222.38s)]
*  here legally, he had protected [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=224.5s)]
*  status in the United States, but [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=226.45999999999998s)]
*  he got rounded up anyway. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=228.38s)]
*  Now, how would you prove that you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=230.01999999999998s)]
*  have protected status? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=231.66s)]
*  Well, you would do it through [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  the courts, a judge would weigh in, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=233.9s)]
*  a judge would adjudicate based on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=235.62s)]
*  the evidence that's presented. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=237.26s)]
*  But when you rip due process away, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=239.34s)]
*  that individual doesn't even have [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=241.3s)]
*  the ability to provide evidence to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=243.14s)]
*  say no, no, no, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=244.94s)]
*  I'm not here legally, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=245.78s)]
*  I am here legally, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  here's my protected status. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=248.22s)]
*  There's no evidence of me being in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=250.46s)]
*  a gang. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=251.7s)]
*  So let's get to some more of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=253.9s)]
*  the results here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=255.38s)]
*  On the flip side, 46% said they [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=256.22s)]
*  strongly oppose and 15% say they [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=258.38s)]
*  somewhat oppose, meaning 61% of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=261.3s)]
*  respondents are against the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=263.74s)]
*  deportations and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=265.78s)]
*  indefinite imprisonments. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=267.14s)]
*  13% of respondents say that they're [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=269.58s)]
*  unsure of how they feel. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=271.74s)]
*  So look, we can break things down [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=273.7s)]
*  even further by party affiliation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=275.34s)]
*  32% of Republicans strongly support [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=277.18s)]
*  along with 1% of Democrats and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=279.78s)]
*  13% of independents who strongly [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=281.94s)]
*  support the idea of deporting [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=284.21999999999997s)]
*  these migrants or [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=286.3s)]
*  these individuals without due [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  process. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=289.9s)]
*  I can't believe there's even 1% of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=290.46s)]
*  Democrats who would want this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=292.34s)]
*  But 78% of Democrats say no, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=294.02s)]
*  you need due process. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=296.14s)]
*  45% of independents say the same. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=297.82s)]
*  And 18, I'm sorry, 78% of Democrats [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=300.9s)]
*  strongly oppose of what Trump is [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=303.26s)]
*  doing in ripping due process away [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  from this entire situation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=307.73999999999995s)]
*  45% of independents feel the same [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=309.78s)]
*  way and so do 18% of Republicans. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=312.14s)]
*  Now, basically Americans overall [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=315.14s)]
*  oppose the idea of deporting [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=318.06s)]
*  people without due process. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=319.82s)]
*  To El Salvador specifically and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=321.82s)]
*  they oppose it by a more than [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=323.74s)]
*  two to one margin. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=325.42s)]
*  So look, there's a lot of humanity [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=326.94s)]
*  left in the country. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=328.97999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you wouldn't think it based [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=330.46s)]
*  on what you see online or [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=332.53999999999996s)]
*  the doom and gloom that you see in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=333.94s)]
*  the news day in and day out. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=335.78s)]
*  But let's go to Jesse Waters now, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=337.5s)]
*  because I guess we're going to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=339.5s)]
*  follow up this good news with [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=341.34s)]
*  Jesse Waters, let's watch. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=343.06s)]
*  Time Magazine was there when [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=345.66s)]
*  the gay barber from Venezuela who [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=347.70000000000005s)]
*  had a crown tattoo that said mom [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=350.18s)]
*  was being processed coming into [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=352.38s)]
*  the El Salvador. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=354.58000000000004s)]
*  Am I boring you again? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=355.94s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=357.78000000000003s)]
*  But you've been talking about this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=358.3s)]
*  gay barber from El Salvador with [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=360.06s)]
*  some stupid tattoo for weeks. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=363.42s)]
*  Come on. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=363.94s)]
*  It's just a gay barber. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=364.66s)]
*  He's not into you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=366.14000000000004s)]
*  He's an innocent guy who got swept [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  up in a deportation and hopefully [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=369.42s)]
*  we get it figured out and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  straightened out. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  A lot of people in this country, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=374.42s)]
*  Jessica, get arrested for [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=376.74s)]
*  things that they didn't do, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=378.58s)]
*  get falsely accused, falsely [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=380.7s)]
*  convicted. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=382.98s)]
*  I'm also against racial fraud. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=383.78s)]
*  That doesn't mean you just stop [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=384.82s)]
*  arresting people. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=387.26s)]
*  That doesn't mean you stop [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=388.98s)]
*  arresting criminals because one guy [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=390.62s)]
*  was arrested who was innocent. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=392.86s)]
*  It just means you just try to do it [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=395.06s)]
*  better the next time and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=396.74s)]
*  I have nothing against the gay [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=397.86s)]
*  barbers. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=399.26s)]
*  Gay barbers usually give [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=400.02s)]
*  the best haircuts. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=400.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=404.38s)]
*  All right, Jesse. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=406.9s)]
*  So look, this isn't about, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=409.14s)]
*  we're going to stop deporting [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=411.1s)]
*  people. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=413.14s)]
*  That's what he's, look, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=413.86s)]
*  let's keep it real. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=415.1s)]
*  He just doesn't want any mention of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=415.86s)]
*  anything that makes the Trump [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=417.9s)]
*  administration look bad on the one [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=419.62s)]
*  thing Trump is still pulling well [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=421.82s)]
*  on. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=423.86s)]
*  That's what's really at the heart [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=424.38s)]
*  of Jesse Waters being super annoyed [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=426.18s)]
*  with Tarloff bringing this issue [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=428.21999999999997s)]
*  up. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=430.06s)]
*  But this isn't about whether or [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=431.26s)]
*  not you can deport individuals who [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=433.22s)]
*  are here illegally or individuals [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=435.3s)]
*  who are here illegally and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  are committing other crimes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=438.90000000000003s)]
*  This is about due process. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=440.66s)]
*  Sending an innocent guy, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=442.1s)]
*  especially a gay barber or [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=444.22s)]
*  a gay makeup artist to El Salvador, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=446.42s)]
*  specifically to that facility is [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  one of the worst things you could [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=452.1s)]
*  possibly do. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=454.7s)]
*  That guy can get really hurt. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=455.74s)]
*  I mean, he's acting like he's being [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=458.58s)]
*  put in some vacation, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=460.82s)]
*  like a resort community or [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=462.5s)]
*  something for the time being. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=464.02s)]
*  And yeah, we'll fix it, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=465.14s)]
*  we'll get him back. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=466.06s)]
*  No, no, he's being sent or [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=466.94s)]
*  has been sent to an awful place [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=468.9s)]
*  where it's difficult for his [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=471.26s)]
*  lawyers to get in touch with him. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=473.65999999999997s)]
*  And there was no due process, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=476.38s)]
*  which is, by the way, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=478.98s)]
*  a process put in place to prevent [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=480.86s)]
*  these types of mistakes from [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=483.53999999999996s)]
*  happening. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=485.86s)]
*  I remember the day when Republicans [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=488.26s)]
*  at least pretended they cared [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=490.3s)]
*  about constitutional rights. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=492.02s)]
*  And by the way, clearly when it [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=493.7s)]
*  comes to American voters, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=495.65999999999997s)]
*  Republican voters, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=497.34s)]
*  a huge portion of them still do [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  care about those constitutional [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=500.53999999999996s)]
*  rights. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=502.53999999999996s)]
*  But you wouldn't think it based on [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=503.14s)]
*  the comments you hear from [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=505.14s)]
*  conservative media figures or [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=506.7s)]
*  even from members of Trump's [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=508.62s)]
*  administration. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=510.46s)]
*  If you've made a mistake, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=511.85999999999996s)]
*  fess up to it, apologize for it, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=514.1s)]
*  and talk about how it's not going [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=516.9399999999999s)]
*  to happen again and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdr-xw2SvKk&t=519.42s)]
