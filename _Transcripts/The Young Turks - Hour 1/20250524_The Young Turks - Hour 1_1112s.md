"‚ÄúDaily Show‚Äù host Jon Stewart on Thursday argued that Democrats who rallied behind President Joe Biden amid concerns over his stamina and cognitive abilities contributed to a ‚Äúlast gasp‚Äù of the party‚Äôs status quo.

‚ÄúWe need to overcome, I think, the stink,‚Äù said Stewart in the latest episode of his ‚ÄúWeekly Show‚Äù podcast."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Jon Stewart's UNFORGETTABLE New Slogan For Democrats
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA)
*  It's not just that we need to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=0.0s)]
*  overcome, I think, the stink. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=2.0s)]
*  It's that- [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=4.0s)]
*  But- [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=4.94s)]
*  By the way, if that is not [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  a Democrats slogan in 2028, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=7.12s)]
*  something has gone terribly wrong. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=9.1s)]
*  Overcome the stink. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=11.58s)]
*  If I don't have that on a bumper [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=13.08s)]
*  sticker- [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=15.0s)]
*  It's compelling. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=15.6s)]
*  But it's compelling. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=16.6s)]
*  John Stewart sat down with [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=18.12s)]
*  Pond Save America hosts John [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=19.84s)]
*  Favreau and John Lovett to talk [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=21.8s)]
*  about the Democrats epic failures [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=24.12s)]
*  in 2025. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=26.76s)]
*  The Democrats epic failures in 2024 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=27.58s)]
*  and the Biden team's decision to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=30.14s)]
*  cover up his obvious mental [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  decline, which led to John Stewart [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=34.3s)]
*  suggesting that the slogan for [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=36.56s)]
*  2028 should be overcome the stink. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=38.6s)]
*  We'll hear more from the Johns, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=41.12s)]
*  all three of them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=43.36s)]
*  But first, Cenk, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=44.76s)]
*  is that a winning slogan? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=46.2s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't go in that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=49.16s)]
*  direction. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=50.32s)]
*  I think they have that issue, but [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=50.96s)]
*  I wouldn't go that way. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=52.56s)]
*  But I think they're having [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=53.92s)]
*  a super important conversation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  And John Stewart keeps forcing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=56.88s)]
*  the Democrats into uncomfortable [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=58.32s)]
*  conversations, which I love. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=59.96s)]
*  Because you can't get to a better [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=61.52s)]
*  place until you have those tough [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  conversations. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=64.68s)]
*  Now there's a lot that was said [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=65.72s)]
*  there that I agree with and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  some that I don't agree with, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=68.72s)]
*  including something else that John [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=70.36s)]
*  Lovett said, who you just saw [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=72.44s)]
*  there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  So I want to come back to that in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=74.88s)]
*  a minute. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=76.6s)]
*  But Jordan, tell us more. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=77.48s)]
*  So John, John and John also talked [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=80.0s)]
*  about the Democrats' unwillingness [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=82.44s)]
*  to challenge Biden in 2024, aside [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=85.36s)]
*  from Cenk, Marion Williamson, and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  Dean Phillips, and obviously, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  the subsequent loss to Trump. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=92.36s)]
*  John Stewart compared the harm to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=94.36s)]
*  the horrible failure to recognize [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=96.6s)]
*  Biden's shortcomings and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=99.0s)]
*  the status of the Democratic Party [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  and what the Iraq War did to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=105.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=106.16s)]
*  The Iraq War for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=106.83999999999999s)]
*  the Republicans turned out to be, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=107.96s)]
*  in some respects, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=110.32s)]
*  an extinction event. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  If you remember correctly, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  they were all behind. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=115.76s)]
*  A lot of Democrats voted for it, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=116.56s)]
*  too, but that whole global war on [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=117.92s)]
*  terror and the way that it was [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=119.44s)]
*  begun and the weapons of mass [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=120.72s)]
*  destruction and all those things. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=121.92s)]
*  Without them realizing it, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=124.88s)]
*  I think, was the last gas of that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=126.56s)]
*  status quo, Republicanism, and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=128.8s)]
*  really set the stage for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=131.24s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=133.08s)]
*  And I think this event for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=134.88s)]
*  Democrats will have a similar [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=137.2s)]
*  effect in that it has sown the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=140.0s)]
*  seeds for a real, and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=143.12s)]
*  it's an opportunity for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  an interesting reinvention of what [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=147.24s)]
*  this Democratic Party can be. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=150.84s)]
*  I actually think there should be [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=153.8s)]
*  excitement, not trepidation, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=157.0s)]
*  around what this is. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=160.6s)]
*  But it's going to come from [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=162.84s)]
*  someone outside of it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=164.68s)]
*  I think anybody that has any of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=166.52s)]
*  that stink on them is not going to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=168.96s)]
*  be particularly successful. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=171.96s)]
*  It felt like the last gas of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=174.88s)]
*  the status quo Democratic Party. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=177.0s)]
*  In response, John Lovett argued [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=180.6s)]
*  that the Democratic Party is filled [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=182.48s)]
*  with many people who aren't [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=184.6s)]
*  comfortable rocking the boat. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=186.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=188.56s)]
*  I think on the Democratic side, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=189.28s)]
*  we got a lot of front of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=191.44s)]
*  the classroom, raise their hand, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=193.0s)]
*  please the teacher types. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=195.48s)]
*  We got a lot of- [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=197.32s)]
*  We do, we got a lot of- [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=198.32s)]
*  Teachers pets? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=199.88s)]
*  The Democratic Party is teachers [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=201.56s)]
*  pets? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=203.0s)]
*  A lot of front of the classroom [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=203.52s)]
*  kids. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=205.24s)]
*  A lot of hall monitors. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and the front of the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  classroom kids, they are the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  people you want running the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=211.12s)]
*  student council, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=212.84s)]
*  You do. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  Are they? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=214.84s)]
*  Are they? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=215.36s)]
*  They can be frustrating, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=216.36s)]
*  they can be annoying, but [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=219.88000000000002s)]
*  they show up, they do the work. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=221.32000000000002s)]
*  But they generally do what [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=223.0s)]
*  the teachers want, not what [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=224.24s)]
*  the students want. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=226.36s)]
*  So there's a couple ways of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=228.36s)]
*  looking at it, Cenk. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm curious which side you fall on. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  What do you want to see in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  the Democratic Party? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=233.44s)]
*  Yeah, unsurprisingly, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  I'm 100% on Jon Stewart's side. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=235.92s)]
*  I think it's a great moment for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=238.44s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=239.32s)]
*  I think the old leadership and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=240.16s)]
*  the establishment were a disaster. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=241.64s)]
*  And they've been destroying [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  this Democratic Party, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=245.28s)]
*  not just recently, but for decades. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=246.2s)]
*  Literally chapter four of my book, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=248.6s)]
*  Justice is Coming, about how [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=250.32s)]
*  the Democratic Party got captured [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  by corporate interests and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=253.92s)]
*  their leadership over the last 40 [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  years has been playing good cop, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=256.48s)]
*  bad cop with the Republicans [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=258.88s)]
*  serving their donors and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=260.35999999999996s)]
*  never their voters. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  They betray their base at every [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=263.23999999999995s)]
*  turn. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  It's time to redo [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=266.4s)]
*  So I have strong feelings about [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  that, we can come back to that as [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=268.44s)]
*  well. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=269.47999999999996s)]
*  But there's something that annoys [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=270.28s)]
*  me, guys, and I'm curious what you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=271.84s)]
*  guys think about it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=273.2s)]
*  So now after the election is over, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  John Lovett's telling me about how [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  the Democrats are the kids that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=279.44s)]
*  are trying to please the teachers [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=281.55999999999995s)]
*  sitting in the front of the class. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  And then John Favreau says, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=285.32s)]
*  like hall monitors, etc, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=287.6s)]
*  But when we were saying that before [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=290.48s)]
*  the election, we got nothing but [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=292.32s)]
*  pushback, including sometimes by [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=294.24s)]
*  those guys, right? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=296.44s)]
*  And then John Lovett explained it [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=298.56s)]
*  a little bit later. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=300.24s)]
*  He said this, I don't want to be [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=301.48s)]
*  somebody suddenly having the words [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=303.04s)]
*  we're saying taken out of context [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  and all of a sudden be part of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=306.48s)]
*  the case against Joe Biden. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  He's explaining why he did not [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=309.2s)]
*  speak out against Joe Biden, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=310.76s)]
*  even though he did think he was too [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=312.32s)]
*  old. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=314.08s)]
*  And all of a sudden be part of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=314.6s)]
*  the case against Joe Biden from [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=316.36s)]
*  the right that would use any person [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  criticizing Joe Biden from the left [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  as a weapon against them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=322.32s)]
*  So look, on the one hand, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=324.48s)]
*  I understand that logic and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=325.96s)]
*  it's the logic that everyone uses [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=327.44s)]
*  to make sure that no one ever [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=329.2s)]
*  criticizes a Democratic leader. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=330.68s)]
*  Which is, well, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  if somebody from the left says it, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=333.52s)]
*  then it's going to get amplified and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  then the right wing is going to use [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=336.48s)]
*  it for their narrative, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=337.84s)]
*  then maybe Biden is too old. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=339.0s)]
*  But under that logic, guys, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=340.36s)]
*  you never ever criticize any [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  Democratic leader. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=344.12s)]
*  So power corrupts and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=345.68s)]
*  absolute power corrupts absolutely. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=346.8s)]
*  And the Democratic voters, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=348.92s)]
*  because of the propaganda of MSNBC [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=350.56s)]
*  and so many other left wing media [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=352.6s)]
*  outlets, said bow your head, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=354.52s)]
*  bow your head, always obey [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  Democratic leaders. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=358.0s)]
*  And if you ever question them, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  you're helping the right wing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=361.12s)]
*  So this is what gets me to my issue [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=362.88s)]
*  here that I want to ask you guys [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=365.08s)]
*  about. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=367.24s)]
*  So what am I supposed to do with [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=368.48s)]
*  the guys like the Pod Save America [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=370.12s)]
*  guys? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  No personal beef at all. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=372.64s)]
*  They're good guys, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=373.72s)]
*  I've talked to them a couple times, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  smart guys, etc. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=376.16s)]
*  And I'll take yes for [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  an answer, etc. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=378.12s)]
*  But am I supposed to just go like, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=379.48s)]
*  okay, yeah, now I'm supposed to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=382.16s)]
*  believe that in the next elections, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  they're not going to do [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=387.32000000000005s)]
*  the same exact thing? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  And I got yelled at by all [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=390.92s)]
*  the hall monitors. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=392.44s)]
*  And now all of a sudden they're [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=394.24s)]
*  laughing about the hall monitors as [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=395.88s)]
*  if they're bothered by them. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=397.88s)]
*  So am I just supposed to be a good, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=399.56s)]
*  okay, I'll take it, I'll eat it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=401.8s)]
*  We'll just pretend that this is [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  like they knew it all along and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=406.32s)]
*  everybody's a good guy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=408.12s)]
*  I don't know, on a personal level [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=410.35999999999996s)]
*  of bothers me, that's why I'm [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=412.2s)]
*  bringing it up here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=413.96s)]
*  But then later, way more [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=415.32s)]
*  importantly, we'll talk about [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=416.64s)]
*  the effect it has going forward. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=418.32s)]
*  But Jackson, what do you think? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think I mean, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=421.76s)]
*  whether it's Pod Save America or [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=422.76s)]
*  anybody who's a Democratic insider [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=424.56s)]
*  or part of that world, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  at this point it's up to them to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  change and adapt their approach. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=430.12s)]
*  If they want to stay relevant, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=432.48s)]
*  because as was pointed out, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  that old guard of the Democratic [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=435.88s)]
*  party is done and outside of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=437.8s)]
*  corruption, a lot of it's really [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  just as simple and straightforward [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  as so many of the politicians who [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=443.68s)]
*  have held elected office have, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=445.76s)]
*  they're 80, they're 75, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  their time has come and gone, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=449.8s)]
*  their approach just doesn't work [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=451.88s)]
*  anymore. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  And that Bill Clinton approach, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=455.92s)]
*  it sold for a little bit because [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=458.04s)]
*  the economy was overall shut down. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=460.0s)]
*  It was all stronger at the time. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=462.4s)]
*  That vision could still go a long [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  way in terms of expanding the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=465.64s)]
*  business sector because it hadn't [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=467.4s)]
*  yet really crippled the middle [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=469.64s)]
*  class as much as it did after [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=471.71999999999997s)]
*  the Obama era. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=473.44s)]
*  I mean, really until Trump got [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=474.64s)]
*  in office, the Democrats hadn't had [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=476.4s)]
*  to do that much different because [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=478.64s)]
*  they could still win elections. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  But then Trump came along and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=482.67999999999995s)]
*  there was just the assumption that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=484.12s)]
*  all people won't do this. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=485.88s)]
*  And that was the assumption in [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  this last election. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, we already had Trump once, so [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  there's no way that people are [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=491.8s)]
*  going to do this again. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=493.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=495.0s)]
*  the biggest problem with [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=496.48s)]
*  the Democratic establishment, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=497.84s)]
*  yeah, there's messaging and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=499.8s)]
*  all of that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=501.56s)]
*  But the biggest issue is their lack [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=502.32s)]
*  of deliverance on things that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=504.36s)]
*  really make a difference in [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=506.12s)]
*  people's lives. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=507.68s)]
*  People can't afford anything. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=508.68s)]
*  If that weren't the case, then [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=510.68s)]
*  Trumpism wouldn't have sold [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=512.68s)]
*  the way that it has. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=514.48s)]
*  I want to point out, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=515.84s)]
*  the Pod Save guys did an episode [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=517.3199999999999s)]
*  the day after the debate. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=519.68s)]
*  And they were saying, no, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=522.12s)]
*  just throwing the towel, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=523.88s)]
*  it's over, this isn't happening. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=525.68s)]
*  And part of me is like, yeah, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  okay, good on them. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  There were many Democrats and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=531.92s)]
*  many Democrats in the media who [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=534.12s)]
*  attacked them for that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=536.4s)]
*  And there were many, many Democrats [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=538.36s)]
*  who refused to acknowledge what we [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=540.24s)]
*  all saw, what we all witnessed. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=542.0s)]
*  They did it the very next day. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=543.88s)]
*  They recorded an episode that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  night. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=546.72s)]
*  So in one way you could say, yeah, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=547.24s)]
*  they were out there saying this is [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=549.28s)]
*  bad. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=551.28s)]
*  I would argue you should have been [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=553.04s)]
*  saying that in 2019, 2020, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=555.16s)]
*  because we saw that then. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=557.04s)]
*  It only got worse. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=559.0s)]
*  The risk signs were there. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=560.72s)]
*  So sure, yes, that's good, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=562.36s)]
*  they were doing it, but also [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=564.16s)]
*  shouldn't have even been in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=565.92s)]
*  that position. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=567.76s)]
*  It certainly should have been well [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=568.88s)]
*  before we even got to the point of [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=570.76s)]
*  a debate in the general election. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=572.6s)]
*  It should have happened even before [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  the 2024 primary season. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=576.76s)]
*  And you don't want to talk about [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=578.84s)]
*  the gunners in class or [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  the straight A students. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=582.2s)]
*  In a way, that's kind of how the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=583.64s)]
*  entire democratic media ecosystem [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  operated. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=588.08s)]
*  But let's talk about some of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=588.88s)]
*  the other criticism that they [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=590.44s)]
*  offered. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=592.16s)]
*  John Favreau went on to say that [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  he's encouraging democratic [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=594.6s)]
*  politicians to stop talking to [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=596.32s)]
*  their advisors and looking at [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=598.24s)]
*  the polls when Trump does something [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=600.0s)]
*  crazy. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=602.12s)]
*  Rather just express how they [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=602.64s)]
*  personally feel about it so [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=604.36s)]
*  it comes off as authentic. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=606.0s)]
*  Which triggered a fascinating [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=607.8s)]
*  memory for John Stewart about his [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=609.48s)]
*  interactions with lawmakers and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=611.36s)]
*  their teams at The Daily Show. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=613.48s)]
*  He said politicians were often [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=615.28s)]
*  scared to come on the show and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=616.88s)]
*  that he'd have to sit down with [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  their teams beforehand. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=620.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=621.72s)]
*  And we would do like a panel with [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=622.48s)]
*  them. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  I would talk to them and [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=624.96s)]
*  they would ask questions. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=626.28s)]
*  And they inevitably, so my boss, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=627.88s)]
*  I'd love to have him have [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=630.36s)]
*  a successful appearance on [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=632.2s)]
*  The Daily Show. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=634.36s)]
*  I think that would be really [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=635.72s)]
*  a good thing for my boss. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=637.12s)]
*  What's your advice on what would [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=638.0400000000001s)]
*  make a successful appearance? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=639.84s)]
*  And I'd go, well, your boss could [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=641.6s)]
*  come on the show and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=644.12s)]
*  tell me what they think. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=645.4000000000001s)]
*  And then what I'll do is I'll say [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=646.96s)]
*  what I think about what they said. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=649.2800000000001s)]
*  And then we'll talk about that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=651.8000000000001s)]
*  And they'd be like, so [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=654.0s)]
*  the strategy is authenticity. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=655.64s)]
*  And I'm like, no, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=657.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm not telling you a strategy. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=659.32s)]
*  I'm saying just talk like a person. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=661.76s)]
*  Okay, so Jack, I think the key here [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=665.28s)]
*  for Democrats is to pretend to be [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  authentic in 2018. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=669.0s)]
*  Is that the takeaway? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=670.24s)]
*  But I swear to you guys that that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  is the takeaway. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=673.52s)]
*  I swear to God, I've seen reports [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=674.56s)]
*  of consultants telling the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=676.56s)]
*  establishment Democrats to pretend [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=678.12s)]
*  to be populist, pretend to be [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  authentic. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=682.12s)]
*  I mean- [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=682.92s)]
*  Put your genuine hat on. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, when you have a consultant [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=684.52s)]
*  telling you to be authentic, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=686.68s)]
*  that's just, I mean, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=688.6s)]
*  that's just, I mean, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  telling you to be authentic, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=692.52s)]
*  that's just, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=694.48s)]
*  it doesn't get funnier than that, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=697.36s)]
*  So look, the most important thing [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=697.88s)]
*  is yes, but what are we going to do [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=700.0799999999999s)]
*  going forward? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=702.4s)]
*  Are we going to go back to saying [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=703.6s)]
*  nope, you're not allowed to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  criticize any establishment [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=707.0s)]
*  Democrat? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=708.68s)]
*  By the way, let's also note [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  the hypocrisy of you're allowed to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=710.56s)]
*  criticize Bernie Sanders all day [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  long. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=713.68s)]
*  You're allowed to rip his face off, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=714.36s)]
*  call him a Bernie bro, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=716.24s)]
*  call him anti-semi, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  imply he's racist and sexist. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=718.64s)]
*  Or any other progressive or [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=721.36s)]
*  populist, Nina Turner in Cleveland. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=722.88s)]
*  Yeah, she said this and that and [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=725.24s)]
*  she's terrible, blah, blah, blah, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=727.36s)]
*  blah, blah, right? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=729.56s)]
*  Attack our side a thousand times. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=730.76s)]
*  And if we even criticize slightly [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=733.16s)]
*  a Democratic leader or [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=734.88s)]
*  somebody in the establishment, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=735.96s)]
*  that's it, you're banned, right? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=737.72s)]
*  And it's not, look guys, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=740.28s)]
*  I'm not picking on Pod Save [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=741.48s)]
*  America. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=742.56s)]
*  Jordan's right, at least they said [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=743.12s)]
*  it the day after the debate, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=744.68s)]
*  others were much worse, right? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=745.92s)]
*  And it's not personal, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=747.48s)]
*  like I told you before, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=748.72s)]
*  Tom Hartman is a great guy. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=750.0799999999999s)]
*  I like him, he's a smart guy, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=751.68s)]

*  No, you had to bow your head to [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=759.64s)]
*  Biden and that's a progressive. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=760.8399999999999s)]
*  That's how deep the virus is, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=762.92s)]
*  right? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=764.8399999999999s)]
*  And I name many others, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=765.8399999999999s)]
*  Roland Martin, right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=767.24s)]
*  Again, I like Roland on a personal [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=768.92s)]
*  level, he's a character. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=770.64s)]
*  And we yell at each other back and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=772.1999999999999s)]
*  forth. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=773.68s)]
*  I'm not holding a grudge against [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=774.24s)]
*  anybody, I'm sure they will [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=775.52s)]

*  against me, right? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=777.64s)]
*  But my God, if you criticize [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=779.28s)]
*  the Democrat, Roland's going to be [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=781.0s)]
*  all over you, all over you, right? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=783.0799999999999s)]
*  So how are we supposed to pick [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=786.6s)]
*  the best candidate if we're not [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  allowed to criticize not just any [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=790.12s)]
*  of the candidates, but your [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=792.16s)]
*  candidates, your establishment [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  candidates? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=795.72s)]
*  You can criticize us all day long [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=796.48s)]
*  and rip our face off, but [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  we're not allowed to do it to you. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=799.28s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=800.72s)]
*  So the proof will be in the pudding. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=802.68s)]
*  So you want to give all of those [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=804.4399999999999s)]
*  establishment figures one more pass. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=806.7199999999999s)]
*  But the next time we have a [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=810.4399999999999s)]
*  primary, don't come try to cancel [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=811.7199999999999s)]
*  me or others, and then tell me [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=813.7199999999999s)]
*  about how you learned your lessons. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  Then we'll know definitively that [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=818.0s)]
*  you didn't learn anything, and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=819.56s)]
*  you're just in the propaganda [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=820.92s)]
*  business, okay? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=822.16s)]
*  So lastly, they can start now. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=823.76s)]
*  So what's stopping Pod Save [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=827.16s)]
*  America from talking about [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=828.52s)]
*  Rebellion PAC? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=829.78s)]
*  What's stopping mainstream media [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=831.16s)]
*  talking about it? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=832.4s)]
*  There's three great candidates, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=833.1999999999999s)]
*  one of them is a very respected [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=834.56s)]
*  member of Congress, O'Connor. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=835.88s)]
*  There's Richard Ojeda running in [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=837.08s)]
*  North Carolina, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=838.56s)]
*  where Andy Bryce running in [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=839.24s)]
*  Wisconsin. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=840.4399999999999s)]
*  These are true blue Democrats, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=841.0s)]
*  populist wing running in red [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=843.24s)]
*  districts, so you don't have any [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=845.16s)]
*  excuse about it's a blue district. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=847.16s)]
*  You can't criticize an incumbent [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=849.52s)]
*  Democrat. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=851.04s)]
*  Have you learned no lessons? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=851.72s)]
*  And in this case, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=853.04s)]
*  you don't even have that excuse. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=853.6s)]
*  Forget having me on, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=854.96s)]
*  why don't you have those [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=855.76s)]
*  candidates on? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=856.72s)]
*  Where's all the left wing shows [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=857.64s)]
*  who are trying to promote [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=859.04s)]
*  those candidates? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=859.96s)]
*  I don't see a single one doing it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=861.16s)]
*  So what are we doing here? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=863.24s)]
*  Is it real? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=864.44s)]
*  Or is this just more like, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=865.76s)]
*  we promise we'll never make this [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=867.72s)]
*  mistake again. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=869.8s)]
*  Yeah, we misled you on the Iraq [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=871.08s)]
*  War. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=872.84s)]
*  I bet we won't do that again, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=874.0s)]
*  wink, right? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=875.64s)]
*  Come on, guys. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=877.04s)]
*  I just, I hope I want to believe [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=878.08s)]
*  it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=881.12s)]
*  I hope it's true. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=882.0s)]
*  But other than John Stewart, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=883.4s)]
*  who was criticizing before [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=884.96s)]
*  the debate, and [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=886.36s)]
*  the people who really were, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=887.36s)]
*  it's tough to believe them. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=889.08s)]
*  They got to do a lot of things to [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=892.12s)]
*  prove that they're not full [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=893.68s)]
*  crap. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=895.16s)]
*  By the way, the things I talk [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=895.88s)]
*  about, Rillian Pak, or any other [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=897.8s)]
*  Pak, by the way, right? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=899.92s)]
*  That's actually trying to help [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=901.76s)]
*  populism in the right direction [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  for the Democratic Party. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  I'd like to see them be fair about [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=906.68s)]
*  all those things. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=908.68s)]
*  But on top of that, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=910.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to ask one request. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=910.8399999999999s)]
*  Okay, I get it, nobody's ever going [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=912.24s)]
*  to apologize to Marianne Williamson, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=913.8s)]
*  even though she was 100%, right? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=915.6s)]

*  the most courageous. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=918.8s)]
*  And by the way, she had a higher [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=919.76s)]
*  higher number than, I'm blanking, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=922.5999999999999s)]

*  Nikki Haley for most of the race, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  but of course, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=936.4s)]

*  Marianne Williamson, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=939.4s)]
*  let's make fun of her religion. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=940.7199999999999s)]
*  Nikki Haley, she's pulling way [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=942.4s)]
*  lower. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  She's such a corporate goon, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=944.92s)]
*  we love her. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=946.4s)]
*  She's so pro-war and [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=947.16s)]
*  pro-taxless for the rich. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=948.28s)]
*  Let's all hype up Nikki Haley, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=949.92s)]
*  right? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=951.3599999999999s)]
*  Marianne's never going to get [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=951.92s)]
*  an apology. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=953.04s)]
*  Me, that's a joke, there's no way [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=953.8s)]

*  Not one of those people will ever [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=963.88s)]
*  do it. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=965.28s)]
*  So put us aside, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=965.8s)]
*  I know it's unrealistic. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=966.68s)]
*  Can Dean Phillips get an apology? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=968.4s)]
*  Can all of you that didn't have [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=971.12s)]
*  Dean Phillips on your show or [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=972.6s)]
*  mock Dean Phillips or [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=974.04s)]
*  attack Dean Phillips, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=975.2s)]
*  a sitting US congressman who's [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=976.44s)]
*  trying to do right by the Democratic [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=977.96s)]
*  Party in the country, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=979.6s)]
*  Randy yes, Joe Biden in the primary? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=980.88s)]
*  And by the way, did all of you talk [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=982.6800000000001s)]
*  about when we were all taken off [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=984.6800000000001s)]
*  of primary ballots, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  including a sitting congressman in [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=987.88s)]
*  places like Florida, where they [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=990.08s)]
*  just canceled the election? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=991.96s)]
*  Is there going to be any honesty [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=993.8000000000001s)]
*  going forward? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=995.48s)]
*  That's the main question. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=996.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think at the end of [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=998.2800000000001s)]
*  the day, the time of just going [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=999.8000000000001s)]
*  through things the way that they [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1001.36s)]
*  have is done. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1002.96s)]
*  It's not even just that they're [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  going to continue to lose elections, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1005.32s)]
*  but they're not going to get [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1007.24s)]
*  any traction online. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1008.72s)]
*  And the closer we get to, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1010.08s)]
*  especially the main election [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1011.36s)]
*  outside of the primaries, I mean, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1012.88s)]
*  Republican messaging has been [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1014.9200000000001s)]
*  strong despite the fact that Donald [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1016.72s)]
*  Trump has been unpopular. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1018.76s)]
*  He's still able to keep his [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1020.6800000000001s)]
*  ratings wherever they need to be [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1022.2s)]
*  for the general public to be like, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1024.08s)]
*  whatever. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1026.1200000000001s)]
*  So I think that it's nice that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1026.68s)]
*  the establishment Democrats want to [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1028.68s)]
*  keep on pushing forward. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1031.2s)]
*  But like I said before, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1032.96s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi's what 84, 85, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1034.6000000000001s)]
*  it's over for that. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1036.8s)]
*  It's just done. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1038.64s)]
*  It's my generation's time. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1039.96s)]
*  It's Gen X and down. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1041.3600000000001s)]
*  It's our time. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1042.68s)]
*  And at the end of the day, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1043.88s)]
*  who cares what they want, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1045.5600000000002s)]
*  let's run for office. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1047.4s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1049.88s)]
*  I'll say one last thing that'll [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1050.72s)]
*  absolutely outrage [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1052.0800000000002s)]
*  Democratic operatives, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1052.96s)]
*  some of whom have media shows. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1054.2800000000002s)]
*  Your rebuttable presumption should [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1058.72s)]
*  be to vote against [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1060.64s)]
*  incumbents in a primary. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1061.5600000000002s)]
*  And if you're going to be like [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1063.76s)]
*  Carvel and start lying about how, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1064.96s)]
*  well, they're just running against [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1066.68s)]
*  as if they're Republicans. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1068.6s)]
*  No, it's primaries are Democrats [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1069.4799999999998s)]
*  versus Democrats. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1071.12s)]
*  And if you're normally the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1072.6399999999999s)]
*  assumption is, well, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1074.04s)]
*  it's my incumbent, so I guess I'll [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1075.32s)]
*  vote for him again, right? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1077.24s)]
*  No, don't do that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1079.0s)]
*  Assume you should vote against [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1080.32s)]
*  the Democratic incumbent in [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1081.6399999999999s)]
*  a primary, and they have to prove [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1082.8799999999999s)]
*  to you that they have been [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1084.3999999999999s)]
*  a great representative of you. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1085.52s)]
*  And if they can prove that great, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1087.28s)]
*  then vote for them, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  they earned your vote, right? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1089.08s)]
*  But if they can't prove that, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1090.52s)]
*  then vote for anyone else. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1092.04s)]
*  The incumbents have not helped at [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1093.6399999999999s)]
*  all. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1095.8s)]
*  And to Jackson's point, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  Pelosi's 84 running for [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1098.28s)]
*  reelection, Clyburn's 84 running [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1099.72s)]
*  for reelection. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1101.76s)]
*  Jesus, man, what is it enough? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcA0t-Z5IA&t=1103.08s)]
