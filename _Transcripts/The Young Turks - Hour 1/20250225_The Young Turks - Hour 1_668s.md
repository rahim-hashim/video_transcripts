The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Democrats Keep Missing House Votes, You're Not Gonna Believe Why
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU)
*  As Republican House Speaker Mike [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=0.0s)]
*  Johnson is having a hard time [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=1.8s)]
*  keeping his own party united on [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=3.4s)]
*  a budget bill, Democrats seem to be [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=5.12s)]
*  a little bit worried that some of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=7.28s)]
*  the older individuals within the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=9.3s)]
*  party aren't going to be around to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=11.48s)]
*  vote on the budget bill or [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=13.72s)]
*  vote against the budget bill. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=15.36s)]
*  At least that's what we're hearing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=17.16s)]
*  from Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  And that's what Hakeem Jeffries [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=21.0s)]
*  also communicated in a dear [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=23.0s)]
*  colleagues letter that he sent to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=24.76s)]
*  House Democrats. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=26.88s)]
*  Now of course Hakeem Jeffrey is [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=28.32s)]
*  the House Minority Leader. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=29.92s)]
*  And well, Cenk, what do you think [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=32.0s)]
*  about some of the Democrats [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=34.04s)]
*  missing votes because they're too [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=35.72s)]
*  old and frail and ailing? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=37.82s)]
*  Yeah, this is part of the problem. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=40.36s)]
*  One of the guys in the story is a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=41.36s)]
*  guy kind of generally like, but [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=42.96s)]
*  that's my point. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=44.72s)]
*  It doesn't matter if I like you or [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  don't like you, it matters whether [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=47.88s)]
*  you do your job. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=49.84s)]
*  And interesting little bit of drama [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=51.2s)]
*  around Nancy Pelosi in this story, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=53.2s)]
*  we'll get to that as well. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  All right, so [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=56.92s)]
*  let me just set this up for you so [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  you understand the context and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=59.0s)]
*  then we can get to the juicy bits. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=60.4s)]
*  So Republicans, as we all know, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=62.2s)]
*  have a majority in the House. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=64.32s)]
*  But remember, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=66.08s)]
*  it's a razor thin majority. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=67.08s)]
*  So as we speak, the GOP has 218 [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=69.12s)]
*  members in the House, whereas [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=71.56s)]
*  the Democrats have 215. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=73.72s)]
*  Now any disagreement within [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  the Republican Party in the House [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=77.84s)]
*  is going to be an issue for [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=79.84s)]
*  Mike Johnson. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=81.28s)]
*  Because he's going to assume that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=82.36s)]
*  the Democrats are going to vote [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=84.2s)]
*  against the budget bill that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=85.84s)]
*  Republicans are drafting. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=87.48s)]
*  But there is dissent within [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=89.24s)]
*  the Republican caucus. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=90.92s)]
*  Remember, you still have the House [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=92.4s)]
*  Freedom Caucus, those are the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=94.48s)]
*  Republicans who are further to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=96.36s)]
*  the right in their ideology, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=98.2s)]
*  certainly as it pertains to matters [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=99.96s)]
*  of fiscal responsibility. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=102.16s)]
*  So they want deeper cuts in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=104.56s)]
*  the budget. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=106.2s)]
*  And so if Mike Johnson is going to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=107.28s)]
*  lose several of them, he is going [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=109.32s)]
*  to need to appeal to Democrats. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=111.44s)]
*  But the big question remains, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=113.44s)]
*  will enough Democrats be healthy [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=115.8s)]
*  enough to show up and vote? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so first let me give you some [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  details on where things stand right [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  now with the budget bill. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  House Republicans are planning [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=126.6s)]
*  a vote on a budget resolution that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=128.64s)]
*  lays out at least $4.5 trillion in [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=130.88s)]
*  tax cuts and a $4 trillion debt [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=133.4s)]
*  limit increase, that's a lot, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=135.72s)]
*  as well as $2 trillion in cuts to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=138.16s)]
*  Medicaid, nutrition assistance, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=140.6s)]
*  student loans, and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=143.28s)]
*  other federal programs. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=144.72s)]
*  Now this is a side note, but [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=146.2s)]
*  it's important to know it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=147.48s)]
*  Just last week, Donald Trump in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=148.88s)]
*  a joint interview with Elon Musk [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=150.92s)]
*  told Sean Hannity that he does not [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=152.88s)]
*  want cuts to Medicaid. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=155.04s)]
*  Now, let's see what happens because [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=157.2s)]
*  that provision as it stands is in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=159.4s)]
*  the budget bill that Republicans [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=161.32s)]
*  have drafted up. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=163.24s)]
*  Yeah, look, we're burning the lead [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=164.36s)]
*  on this story, but we'll do more [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=166.52s)]
*  stories on it as this unfolds [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=168.52s)]
*  because this is the actual plan. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=170.44s)]
*  All like, we're taking Greenland, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Panama Canal, nonsense, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  total nonsense, this is the plan. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=177.16s)]
*  And Magga, what did I tell you? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=179.52s)]
*  $4.5 trillion in tax cuts for [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=182.56s)]
*  corporations and the rich, and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=184.24s)]
*  where are they going to take it [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=186.0s)]
*  from? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=187.56s)]
*  They cut a couple of bucks here and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=188.08s)]
*  there, you think that's going to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  cover $4.5 trillion? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=191.08s)]
*  No way, no, they're going to take [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=192.24s)]
*  it from you, from Medicaid and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=194.32s)]
*  from other programs that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  average American relies on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=197.8s)]
*  So how is this populist when you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=200.0s)]
*  take from the average American and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  you give to the richest people in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=204.16s)]
*  the country? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=206.2s)]
*  Meet the new boss same as [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=207.04s)]
*  the old boss. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=208.4s)]
*  Exactly, that's exactly right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=209.64s)]
*  And so, look, Trump talks a big [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  talk, especially when he's on [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  Hannity and he says, no, no, no, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=214.92s)]
*  I don't want to touch Medicaid, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=216.84s)]
*  Medicare, Social Security. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=218.56s)]
*  Let's see what he actually does [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=220.04s)]
*  once the House passes a version of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=221.92s)]
*  the budget that obviously would [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  include cuts to Medicaid. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, believe it or not, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  some Republicans think not enough. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=229.56s)]
*  Let's actually rob the American [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=231.76s)]
*  people of more funding for [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=233.76s)]
*  these programs that essentially [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=235.56s)]
*  fund social safety net programs [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=237.64s)]
*  within the federal government. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=239.6s)]
*  One example, for instance, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  is Republican Congresswoman Victoria [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=243.96s)]
*  Spartz, she's a Republican from [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=246.36s)]
*  Indiana. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=248.44s)]
*  She said that she's a no on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=249.16s)]
*  the bill as it stands, while others [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=250.62s)]
*  are privately expressing concerns. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=252.56s)]
*  She wants steeper cuts. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=254.52s)]
*  Mike Johnson can likely only [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=256.16s)]
*  afford two defections at most. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=258.32s)]
*  And that's where the Democrats [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=260.88s)]
*  come in. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=262.44s)]
*  Can he convince Democrats to vote [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=262.94s)]
*  for the budget? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=264.8s)]
*  And believe it or not, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=266.2s)]
*  apparently according to some of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=267.56s)]
*  the Democratic leadership who spoke [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=269.6s)]
*  to Axios, there are some centrists [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=271.8s)]
*  and moderates who are considering [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=274.0s)]
*  it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=276.08s)]
*  Yeah, really? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=277.2s)]
*  Well, that's going to lead to our [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=278.32s)]
*  next story in a minute. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=280.04s)]
*  If you're watching a live show at [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=281.36s)]
*  6 o'clock about how Democrats are [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=283.2s)]
*  now starting to take money from [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=285.24s)]
*  the same exact donor. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=287.04s)]
*  Starting. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=288.56s)]
*  So will they defect because they [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=290.08s)]
*  were literally paid to? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  Maybe, so that's to come. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=295.52s)]
*  But first they got to be able to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=297.52s)]
*  show up. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  So let's talk about that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=299.52s)]
*  Now Axios reports that House [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=300.64s)]
*  Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=302.26s)]
*  in fact worried about older and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=304.52s)]
*  ailing members that have regularly [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  missed votes in recent years, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  especially since the beginning [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=310.64s)]
*  of this year. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=312.44s)]
*  So he wrote a letter to Democrats [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=313.32s)]
*  in the House asking them to maybe [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=315.12s)]
*  consider doing their effing jobs [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  and show up. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=318.76s)]
*  And if they're unable to because of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=319.76s)]
*  their frailty and their age, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=322.2s)]
*  maybe consider retiring. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=324.24s)]
*  He didn't word it that way, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=326.68s)]
*  obviously. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=328.0s)]
*  Again, the guy is boring is [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  watching paint dry, but [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=330.32s)]
*  he did write this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=331.64s)]
*  In a dear colleague letter, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=332.48s)]
*  Jeffries said that given the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=334.44s)]
*  expected closeness of the vote, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=336.48s)]
*  it's imperative that we are present [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=338.76s)]
*  with maximum attendance, he wrote. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=341.2s)]
*  We must be at full strength to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  enhance our opportunity to stop [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=345.56s)]
*  the GOP tax scam in its tracks. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=347.68s)]
*  So the letter to his colleagues, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=350.52s)]
*  by the way, came after House [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=352.4s)]
*  Minority Whip Catherine Clark also [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=353.88s)]
*  stressed the importance of every [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=355.8s)]
*  Democratic member of the House [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=357.64s)]
*  showing up on the day that they [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=359.32s)]
*  vote on this legislation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=361.0s)]
*  Now who are we talking about here? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  Let's actually name some names. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=364.56s)]
*  For instance, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=366.2s)]
*  Representative Raul Grijalva, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  Democrat from Arizona, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=369.32s)]
*  who is 77 years old and was [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  diagnosed with cancer last year, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  has missed every House vote since [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  the January 3rd speaker election. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  His office did not respond to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  a request for comment. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=381.44s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, who is still [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  recovering from hip surgery, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  does plan to show up to vote. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  So I guess credit where credit is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=389.0s)]
*  due. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  But again, another concern for [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  Jeffries is that some of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  the centrists who tend to break [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  ranks with Democrats on key bills [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  might do the same when it comes to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=398.12s)]
*  the budget and vote along with [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=400.04s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  Because look, if they are also [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=403.0s)]
*  taking money from the state, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=404.76s)]
*  if they are also taking money from [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  corporate donors who want the tax [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  cuts, they're going to deliver on [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=409.6s)]
*  behalf of the people they really [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=411.48s)]
*  care about, their donors, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=413.2s)]
*  as opposed to their voters. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=414.76s)]
*  So- Yeah, so the reason I like [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=417.04s)]
*  Raul Grijalva is a personal one, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=419.04s)]
*  but also a policy one. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=421.24s)]
*  I went and asked a couple of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=423.48s)]
*  Congress people to join Just [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  Democrats back when we started [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=426.24s)]
*  that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=427.76s)]
*  And it was a tough ask because we [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  were asking them to do two things [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=429.72s)]
*  that were difficult. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=431.2s)]
*  One was, don't take any corporate [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  PAC money anymore and be okay with [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=434.16s)]
*  primary incumbents. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  So that means your colleagues were [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=439.16s)]
*  going to run against and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  you're going to be okay with that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  Those are very tough asks. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=444.16s)]
*  Only a few people joined Ro Khanna, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=445.8s)]
*  of course, Pramila Jayapal, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=447.72s)]
*  interestingly enough, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=449.24s)]
*  and Raul Grijalva. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=450.6s)]
*  And when I was in his office, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=452.12s)]
*  he asked his staffer, hey, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=453.68s)]
*  do we have any corporate PAC money? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  And she comes back, yeah, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  we have one. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=459.48s)]
*  And he's like, what is it? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  And she tells him, it's like, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=461.68s)]
*  yeah, cancel it, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=462.8s)]
*  I'm joining this group. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so I like him and he's been [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=464.8s)]
*  fighting for the average American [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=466.48s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=468.28s)]
*  But brother, I love you, but [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=469.24s)]
*  why are we running again if we have [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  cancer and we're 77 and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=473.28s)]
*  are struggling to- [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=474.88s)]
*  To do your job. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=476.36s)]
*  To make it into the office, right? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=477.32s)]
*  And you've done good work. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=480.24s)]
*  Let's call it a day, right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=482.44s)]
*  Look, I don't know your personal [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=484.4s)]
*  health situation and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=485.76s)]
*  he's a good guy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=486.52s)]
*  But you got to show up to the votes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=487.44s)]
*  These votes are absolutely critical. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=488.88s)]
*  And so he's not in the usual batch [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=491.12s)]
*  of older Democrats and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=493.16s)]

*  return on investment for [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=496.36s)]
*  corporations and that's why they [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  are around forever, which brings [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=499.72s)]
*  us to Nancy Pelosi. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=501.56s)]
*  So she apparently broke her hip and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=502.76s)]
*  she's recovering from that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=504.6s)]
*  Yes, but again, what is she, 84? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=506.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=508.56s)]
*  I mean, come on, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=509.2s)]
*  what are we doing? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=510.44s)]
*  So now speaking of just Democrats, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=512.16s)]
*  my co-founder, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=514.16s)]
*  Shortcut Trucker Party, who believes [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=515.2s)]
*  in economic populism like I do, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=517.32s)]
*  is actually running against Nancy [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=519.08s)]
*  Pelosi. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=520.88s)]
*  I don't know if he's 45 years [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=521.38s)]
*  old or not, I haven't heard, but [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=522.72s)]
*  somewhere in that ballpark, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=524.32s)]
*  we'll put the link to his [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=525.88s)]
*  congressional website or [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=527.12s)]
*  his candidacy website down [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=528.52s)]
*  the description box. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=530.0s)]
*  My point isn't Shortcut in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=531.32s)]
*  particular or the, I don't like [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=532.9200000000001s)]
*  Pelosi or Grohalva, no, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=534.88s)]
*  I even like Grohalva. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=536.44s)]
*  The point is, you got to show up, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=538.0400000000001s)]
*  stop running when you're 98 and 112. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=540.4s)]
*  It's absurd, it's absurd. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=543.84s)]
*  And so a lot of times the ego gets [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  in the way as well. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=547.6s)]
*  So will they be able to muster up [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=548.64s)]
*  enough votes with their geriatric [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=550.52s)]
*  caucus? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=552.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=554.0s)]
*  And if they lose by one because [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=554.5200000000001s)]
*  they couldn't make it out of [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=556.2800000000001s)]
*  the senior citizen center, and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  then that costs Americans an [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=559.8800000000001s)]
*  enormous amount of money, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=561.6400000000001s)]
*  resources, etc., that is going to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=563.44s)]
*  be a very, very bad look for [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=565.5600000000001s)]
*  this Democratic party. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=567.24s)]
*  Yeah, and look, I think it's [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  important to draw a distinction [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  here, right? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=572.24s)]
*  There are plenty of elderly [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=572.9200000000001s)]
*  lawmakers in Congress who do show [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=574.96s)]
*  up and they're able to do their job. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=577.24s)]
*  So it's not necessarily an age [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=580.12s)]
*  thing, it's more a health thing, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=581.56s)]
*  right? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=583.28s)]
*  You look at Bernie Sanders and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=583.8s)]
*  he's even older than Joe Biden is. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=585.7199999999999s)]
*  But are you really going to pretend [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=588.88s)]
*  like they're the same? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=590.1999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, Bernie Sanders is able [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=591.1199999999999s)]
*  to show up, do his job, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=593.0s)]
*  he's still fiery. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  He's freaking doing a countrywide [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=595.1199999999999s)]
*  tour right now as we speak to speak [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=597.16s)]
*  to people and do a town hall. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=599.04s)]
*  I don't know where Joe Biden is, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=601.4s)]
*  but the point is, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=602.8399999999999s)]
*  it's not really an age thing, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=603.68s)]
*  it's a health thing. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=605.04s)]
*  And if you're unable to do your job, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  it is your responsibility to do [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=608.28s)]
*  what's right on behalf of your [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=610.16s)]
*  constituents and just, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=611.8s)]
*  I mean, please retire. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=613.24s)]
*  Give someone else a shot. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=615.96s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't have to be you for [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=617.72s)]
*  the rest of time, it's okay. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=619.52s)]
*  And really, I mean, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=621.88s)]
*  Graha was such an exception. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=622.72s)]
*  But the rest of you, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=624.64s)]
*  you're all corporate robots anyway. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=625.36s)]
*  You're just going to be replaced by [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=626.8s)]
*  another corporate robot who's going [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=628.16s)]
*  to vote 100% in the same direction, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=629.72s)]
*  literally 100%. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=631.56s)]
*  You all follow exactly what [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=632.64s)]
*  the donors tell you. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=634.04s)]
*  So what difference does it make [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=635.44s)]
*  other than your ego? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=636.76s)]
*  You've already served a billion [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=637.8s)]
*  dollars, ego satiated, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=639.84s)]
*  please move on. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmKFpWietU&t=640.7600000000001s)]
