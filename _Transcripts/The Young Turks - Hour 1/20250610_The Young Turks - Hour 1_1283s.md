Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# The Lies Are Insane
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48)
*  says in there that there's a ban that at state levels they couldn't prosecute some of these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=0.0s)]
*  AI companies, right? That sounds really sketchy. Like- [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=6.4s)]
*  I know what you're talking about, yeah. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=10.0s)]
*  The ban would not only prevent new state led regulations of AI, but would also block dozens [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=11.28s)]
*  of states from enforcing pre-existing AI regulations and oversight structures. It feels scary. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=16.0s)]
*  Popular podcaster Theo Vaughn is beginning to understand that this country is owned by corporate [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  interests. So much so that the federal government is trying to prevent states from being able [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  to regulate AI, which is interesting. I thought states rights meant a lot to the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=37.44s)]
*  Republican Party. Apparently they were full of crap. Now last week, Vice President JD Vance sat down [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=43.6s)]
*  with Theo Vaughn and he was able, Theo Vaughn was able to ask JD Vance about this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=49.36s)]
*  And so it's a provision in the so-called big beautiful bill. And this provision is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=56.88s)]
*  actually something that to my surprise, but to my delight, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=62.0s)]
*  Green spoke out again. So there is some backlash toward this provision. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  And so you saw Vaughn explain why he's nervous about it. Now let's watch Vance [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=74.4s)]
*  try to placate him and calm him down about it. Let's watch. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  The reason that provision is in there is because you think about how woke the Google searches got. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  Remember when you search, what does George Washington look like? And it show you a picture [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=92.48s)]
*  of a black dude. Oh yeah. Or like a little Japanese George Washington or something. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=95.92s)]
*  So the idea is you use, you basically have a federal regulation that prevents [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=101.52s)]
*  a federal regulation that prevents like California from having a super progressive [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=109.6s)]
*  set of regulations on artificial intelligence. That's the argument for it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Okay. Before I continue and present more of this, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=122.88s)]
*  initial thoughts was on how JD Vance handled that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=127.92s)]
*  J.D Vance is like a little bit slicker than I gave him credit for, particularly on the campaign. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=130.72s)]
*  He's pretty good at not coming off as a foaming at the mouth lunatic Republican. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=142.72s)]
*  He's really good at that. That being said, what the hell does wokeness have to do with AI? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=149.6s)]
*  And because I do kind of keep up with this stuff a little bit. There was that Google thing that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=156.96s)]
*  he's talking. It is from a real story when they first rolled out their image generator product, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=163.44s)]
*  their AI image generated product. They were going out of their way to be kind of woke. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  And to be fair, internally, the culture at Google, more so than all of these Silicon Valley [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  places is like the most liberal internal culture of all of those companies. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=185.28s)]
*  So what? They've been known to be that. Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=190.24s)]
*  It's so the F what? Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=193.04s)]
*  They were both image generators. So the federal government gets to say [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=196.88s)]
*  on how progressive a corporation gets to be, but they're hands off when it comes to them [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=202.24s)]
*  robbing the American people, raping and pillaging this country. These people make me sick. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=207.68s)]
*  And do you know the AI that they're doing right now? And is the like the sort of price fixing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=212.72s)]
*  stuff. We're like you type in Nike running sneakers on your browser, depending on your [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=219.04s)]
*  purchase history, the AI will set a different price for you than somebody else. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=225.2s)]
*  How do I get the cheap price? I don't know. We got to find out how to game that system. Okay. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=230.4s)]
*  We're gonna have to get some AI for the AI. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=236.8s)]
*  Dude, AI sucks. Like it's 100%. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=241.68s)]
*  Okay, let me just, this is a side thing. Right now on Substack, there's so many [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  pathetic people just like AI is writing whatever the hell they're putting up there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=253.68s)]
*  And what's so crazy to me, it's all like inspirational slop, right? Inspirational [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=259.92s)]
*  slop on the notes section of Substack. People love it. People love it. We are so basic. We're [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=265.6s)]
*  all basic bitches. Every single one of us like, wow, an inspirational message written by AI, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=271.92s)]
*  super sloppy and lazy. It's not really that inspirational, but we're all basic bitches. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  Anyway, let's get back to the story. So look, Vance is correct that some AI image generators [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=283.12s)]
*  made some bizarre and woke images for a brief period of time. Everyone made fun of it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=288.8s)]
*  It was like two days. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  It was like two days. Everyone made fun of it. But that's not why they're attempting to ban [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=296.0s)]
*  states from being able to regulate AI. This is the real reason why. So in a public comment in March, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=303.6s)]
*  OpenAI specifically asked the Trump administration for a voluntary federal framework [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=311.12s)]
*  that override state AI laws seeking private sector relief from a patchwork of state [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  bills. So Politico reported the following last month, as California and other states move to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=323.84s)]
*  regulate artificial intelligence companies like OpenAI, Meta, Google and IBM are urging [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=330.08s)]
*  Washington to pass national AI rules that would rein in state laws they don't like. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=336.23999999999995s)]
*  So is Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley based venture capitalist firm closely tied [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  to President Donald Trump? Now look, I can understand the argument that if you have this [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=350.48s)]
*  patchwork of different regulations, depending on which state we're talking about, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=356.16s)]
*  this technology obviously is going to be available globally nationwide. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  So having a patchwork of regulations is gonna be difficult to navigate. And oftentimes what ends [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=368.8s)]
*  up happening is companies will just kind of default to the state that has the strictest [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=374.96s)]
*  regulations instead of tinkering with the product in order to make it applicable to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  various states depending on what their regulations are. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  So I'll give you a specific example in a different context. When California implemented their [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=388.96s)]
*  electric car mandate situation, right? Where after a certain year, you won't be able to purchase new [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=397.52s)]
*  gas powered vehicles in the state. That led to the car industry really pivoting toward [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=404.0s)]
*  electric vehicles overall, right? In order to increase their stock and increase the different [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=410.56s)]
*  types of electric vehicle opportunities or products that are available on the market. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=416.32s)]
*  So one state passing a regulation can sometimes impact the way the company operates [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=420.56s)]
*  overall in every other state. So I can understand that argument. With that being said, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=425.6s)]
*  we currently have a Congress that should be abolished because they're ineffective and do [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=430.4s)]
*  nothing for us. They have no interest in regulating AI. They have no interest in [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  protecting the American people, the American worker, and their own constituents. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=440.32s)]
*  And so the reason why we have a patchwork of different laws depending on which state you're in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  is because we have a bunch of lazy, corrupt members of Congress that don't understand the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=450.64s)]
*  technology, have no interest in understanding the technology. They cash the checks from the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=456.56s)]
*  tech industry and they do as they're told. That's the heart of this problem. Go ahead, Was. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=461.52s)]
*  Was- I mean, it's hard to disagree with anything you said there and it's important for people to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  know that these technology guys, they just don't- Yes. They just don't like the notion [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=475.36s)]
*  of regulatory actions taken even on a developing technology. The idea that there would be any [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=485.76s)]
*  handcuffs at all is anathema to what they believe and they would make the argument that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=494.24s)]
*  in order to spur innovation, they need to be unregulated. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=500.23999999999995s)]
*  That's the argument that they would make. I'm like, all right, what are y'all innovating though? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=506.08s)]
*  Whose life is going to be made better by this? I just have no, I have absolutely no faith [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=512.64s)]
*  that this AI thing, like social media before it, like so many other these tech superstars before [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=521.92s)]
*  it are gonna end up being a net negative on society in terms of the quality of our lives. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=530.24s)]
*  I would love to be wrong about that. I would love to think that the everyday common Joe's life [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=537.36s)]
*  is gonna be made so much better by this stuff and we need to just, yeah, go innovate, go make [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=543.92s)]
*  humanity better. Wait, no, that's not what they're gonna do. They're gonna find a new way to sell us [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=549.44s)]
*  pills more efficiently or whatever. That's all is gonna come down to jeans with seven zippers [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=555.84s)]
*  on Instagram. That's it. Sell, sell, sell. That's it. Are those jeans still hot, the seven [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=562.24s)]
*  zipper jeans? I don't know, but they always got the most, the kind of stuff that you won't see at [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  the Gap. That's what kills on Instagram. These pants are different or look at this [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=575.36s)]
*  gadget or look at this, yeah. Yeah. They've mastered the ad sale game and has made them [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=584.72s)]
*  infinitely rich. But when you listen to the rhetoric when this dude, Doofus first started [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=593.36s)]
*  Facebook and Instagram and we're gonna connect people and the world is gonna be so connected [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=599.2s)]
*  and humanity will be brought together. And now it's like, yo, we wanna give you an AI therapist. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=604.96s)]
*  He literally said that. You know what's hilarious? Social media actually just kind of devolved into [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=609.52s)]
*  a platform where you can just express your hatred for various groups of people. That's [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  mostly what social media seems to be for these days. Division, yes. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=623.44s)]
*  Done the opposite of bringing humanity together. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=627.36s)]
*  Totally a place where you can air your grievances with specific individuals publicly instead of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=630.32s)]
*  hitting them up on the phone, having a conversation with them in private. It's so pathetic. Now look, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=635.6s)]
*  I wanna be fair to JD Vance because he did admit that there are some valid concerns about artificial [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=641.9200000000001s)]
*  intelligence. So especially if it's left unregulated. So let's give him a shot. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  Let's see if he can redeem himself in this next clip. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=654.08s)]
*  I actually was talking to a couple of senators on the way down here about this because they [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=656.32s)]
*  really hate this provision. And actually both that we brought them on because it's Bill Hagerty [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=664.0s)]
*  and Marsha Blackburn, great people. They represent the state of Tennessee. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=670.24s)]
*  So they don't like this provision and they brought up a really interesting point. It's because [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=673.44s)]
*  so Tennessee obviously has a lot of musicians, right? And Tennessee wants to protect those [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=678.08s)]
*  musicians from having basically AI steal the production of their artists, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=682.56s)]
*  And they wanna protect people from that kind of thing happening. So that's a totally reasonable [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=689.1199999999999s)]
*  point to me. If the feds aren't protecting artists, then you're not gonna be able to protect [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=693.68s)]
*  artists either. And so honestly, I don't think the provision, to be honest with you, I don't think [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=698.88s)]
*  that's gonna make it in the final bill. But I usually have a pretty strong view on most things. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  I can kind of go both ways on this because I don't want California's progressive regulations [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=708.88s)]
*  to control artificial intelligence. I also agree with Marsha and Bill that you wanna protect [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=712.88s)]
*  country artists in Nashville from having their crap stolen by AI. I get that. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=718.8s)]
*  Artists in Nashville will have their crap stolen by AI because this notion that the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=723.28s)]
*  provision will not make it in the final bill is laughable. That's the funniest thing JD Vance [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=730.4s)]
*  has ever said. You wanna know why? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=735.92s)]
*  I just hate the freaking word games. It's just like, woke is bad, progressive bad. He doesn't [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=736.92s)]
*  say anything specific about what Gavin Newsom might have introduced. It's just the word games [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=744.9599999999999s)]
*  to signal to the right people like, yeah, that thing is bad cuz I just called it progressive. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  It's so mind numbingly stupid and annoying, but it is effective. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=755.76s)]
*  Yeah, yep. And the AI lobbyists, they're going hard and they're very present and very visible [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=761.12s)]
*  around the Capitol, according to Representative Don Beyer, who says they're nurturing relationships [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=768.96s)]
*  with lots of senators and a handful of members of the House in Congress. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=775.6s)]
*  It's really important for their ambitions, their expectations of the future of AI to have Congress [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=780.88s)]
*  involved even if it's only to stop us from doing anything. The overarching ask is for no regulation [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=787.12s)]
*  or for light touch regulation. And so far, they've gotten that said Doug Kalitas, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=796.0s)]
*  Senior Vice President of Government Affairs for the AI policy, non-profit Americans for [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=803.76s)]
*  Responsible Innovation. But I'll leave you with something that might give you [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=809.36s)]
*  a little bit of joy in such a terrible story. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=814.56s)]
*  I was reading a report in USA Today about how the sector that's already been hit hardest [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=819.12s)]
*  by the implementation of AI or the replacement of workers with AI technology. It's a tech sector, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=824.24s)]
*  it's the very sector that developed it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=831.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's- [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=833.68s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=834.8s)]
*  They have employees training AIs to do their jobs before they get, literally. That's not, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=835.36s)]
*  I'm not making that up. That's a thing that employees- [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=842.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=845.76s)]
*  Are training their AI replacements in real time. And I personally would love to see this whole AI [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=846.4s)]
*  I personally would love to see this whole AI gambit just fall and be a complete flop. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=856.08s)]
*  And because- [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=862.64s)]
*  Like VR? Remember when VR was gonna be like the hot thing? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=863.52s)]
*  The metaverse, Jesus Christ. So in order for this to make a lot of money, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=866.96s)]
*  it has to become a consumer product. It has to be something that every American uses, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=873.76s)]
*  right? On the regular. That's how you make something super successful in tech. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=880.16s)]
*  I don't think that's gonna happen. I really hope this fails miserably. The only problem with that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=887.44s)]
*  is they pumped so much money and investment into this becoming something that eventually [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=892.5600000000001s)]
*  becomes profitable. And the market is so tied into these big tech companies. It's basically [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=899.52s)]
*  Apple, Google, Amazon. That's literally what they call the Magnificent Seven or whatever [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=906.24s)]
*  the shit is. If this AI thing doesn't pan out, we're talking about a crazy [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=912.16s)]
*  market crash. And a lot of people, good people would actually be impacted by that. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=919.36s)]
*  Oh, that would suck. Damn, there's one thing that AI does so far that I do wholeheartedly love [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=924.24s)]
*  and appreciate, and I hope it continues. When they have audio, AI read articles, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=934.56s)]
*  there's an audio version of the article available. So you can listen to it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=943.28s)]
*  I do best learning through listening as opposed to reading or watching for whatever freaking reason. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=949.92s)]
*  So I'm able to absorb the information better. I love when articles include that option. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=956.8s)]
*  You love the AI transcription. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=962.0s)]
*  Yes, yeah. And you know what? Yeah, doesn't know how to say ice or [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=964.4s)]
*  words that it should know how to say, but I'll allow it. I know what they mean. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=971.68s)]
*  But that's it. Other than that, AI has not been, and I know a lot of people in our industry that [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=977.2s)]
*  use AI, right? Whether it's to write articles, which is so embarrassing, or to do research, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=981.36s)]
*  Grok is not always going to give you accurate information. Please don't use it as the gospel, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=989.12s)]
*  but they do. They do. Humans love to just lean on anything to not have to think for themselves. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=993.84s)]
*  It's amazing. I've yet to be introduced to an AI thing that could help me with anything. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1002.16s)]
*  So I'm still waiting. Yeah. I'm still waiting. I'm not a maniac who wants to [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1009.04s)]
*  jack off the fake Taylor Swift porn. You know what I mean? That's just insanity. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1015.52s)]
*  That was the first thing these people did when they got the image generator. It's gross. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1021.76s)]
*  Oh my God. It's so gross. That is so nuts, bro. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1027.68s)]
*  It's not gross. Masturbation is natural. I'm not judging. It's just like- [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1032.08s)]
*  But your mind just went to a Taylor Swift porn. That was it? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  That's gross. That part of it is gross. Yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1042.16s)]
*  It's crazy. Anyway, I don't want to think about it. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1044.48s)]
*  I've got a minute, so I'll just do my rant. It's not going to be much of a rant. I don't trust the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1049.2s)]
*  government. I think they waste our money. They don't use our taxpayer dollars to make our lives [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1052.96s)]
*  better. Our lives have consistently gotten worse year after year, year over year. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1056.72s)]
*  I'm not against paying my taxes, clearly. I'm not against, and in fact, call for everyone to [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1062.16s)]
*  pay their fair share of taxes. But I'm sick of working Americans paying a higher percentage [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1069.52s)]
*  of their income toward taxes and then that money not being used to make our lives better. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1076.6399999999999s)]
*  That's what I have a problem with. I don't want to pay my taxes anymore. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1083.2s)]
*  Social security, Medicare, I know exactly where that money's going. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1091.36s)]
*  Worth it. Love paying my taxes for that. No issues whatsoever. Property taxes go toward [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1095.04s)]
*  funding local schools, public schools. Love it. Have no problem with that. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1101.52s)]
*  There's just so much that gets done. So much that our tax dollars get funneled to that I [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1106.0s)]
*  find immoral, reprehensible, disgusting, and we have no say. It doesn't matter which party's [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1114.32s)]
*  in charge. We have no say. So that's my issue with taxes. And by the way, I do have a problem [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1120.48s)]
*  with some taxes that I think should be abolished. Sales tax, you already fucking tax that money. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1126.0s)]
*  You already fucking tax that money and you're gonna tax it again? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1133.44s)]
*  No, sales taxes are fucked up. They should be abolished entirely and they're regressive as [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1138.24s)]
*  fuck too. How regressive our sales taxes was? Come on. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1143.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's about as regressive as it gets because the poorer you are, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1146.3999999999999s)]
*  the higher percentage of your income that the tax is. So really rich people can afford to eat that [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1153.1999999999998s)]
*  tax, obviously, and then people that are struggling, it's a higher portion of their income. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1160.4799999999998s)]
*  It's by definition, it hurts the people at the bottom way more than it does at the top. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1165.84s)]
*  And so yeah, sucks. But that's what the tariffs are. That's what the sales tax is. That's what [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1173.6799999999998s)]
*  the system is. Yep. Anyway, I know that was a short rant, but yeah, you have- [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1181.28s)]
*  You've had a few rants lately. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1188.24s)]
*  Because, Waz, I'm just sick of- No, I love it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1191.9199999999998s)]
*  I know everyone feels this. I'm so sick of working harder and harder every year and watching [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1195.76s)]
*  quality of life get worse and worse every year. It's just frustrating and I hate our government. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1202.64s)]
*  I do. I really hate our government and it's not just about Trump. It's dysfunctional, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1209.76s)]
*  doesn't serve us, doesn't serve the American people. And until that changes, it's just hard [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1215.44s)]
*  for me to vociferously advocate for some of the policies that I think would be fantastic if we had [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1222.4s)]
*  a government that worked for us, a government that didn't waste our money. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1229.36s)]
*  I mean, look at California. It's not like the problem in California is the lack of funds being [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1233.4399999999998s)]
*  allocated to projects that we care about. Those funds are allocated to the projects we care about, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1240.7199999999998s)]
*  but it gets squandered. There's waste, there's fraud, there's abuse to an extreme in California. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1246.24s)]
*  And that infuriates me because we never actually get the policies that we vote in favor of [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1253.28s)]
*  accomplished in this state. And then in the end, we end up with a $1 billion deficit in LA County, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1258.56s)]
*  LA City specifically. And we get services cut even though we pay the highest taxes [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1265.44s)]
*  in all of the land. It's infuriating. Anyway, those are my takes. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPw6KJRM48&t=1271.52s)]
