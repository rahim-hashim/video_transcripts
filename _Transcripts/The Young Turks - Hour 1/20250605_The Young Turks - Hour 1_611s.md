# Trump takes VENGEANCE
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE)
*  Sometimes when I watch Trump speak, I feel like I'm watching a baby wrestle with his food. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=0.0s)]
*  Right, what are you doing, brother? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=9.76s)]
*  Your predecessor dismissed your auto pen investigation. He said he made all the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=11.44s)]
*  decisions during his presidency. I'm curious your reaction to his dismissal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=15.68s)]
*  Well, look, the auto pen, I think is the big scandal outside of the rigged election of 2020. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=18.72s)]
*  I think the biggest scandal of the last many years is the auto pen. Look, he was never for [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=24.32s)]
*  open borders. He was never for transgender for everybody. He was never for men playing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=29.12s)]
*  in women's sports. I mean, he changed, I mean, all of these things that changed so radically. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=34.88s)]
*  I don't think he had any idea. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=39.84s)]
*  The auto pen, the auto pen. Yesterday, President Donald Trump ordered his administration to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  investigate what he is calling the auto pen scandal. Trump is claiming that during [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=48.0s)]
*  Joe Biden's presidency, Biden was not the one making decisions. Instead, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=53.44s)]
*  other members of his administration were. They were creating policies using an auto pen machine [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=57.36s)]
*  to put Biden's signature on them. They make it seem like he was just propped up there, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=62.88s)]
*  and they were doing all the work, maybe. A lot to discuss with the story. We'll get [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=67.44s)]
*  into the details in a moment. But Cenk, do you think Donald Trump has a leg to stand on here? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=72.16s)]
*  Yes, I think he does, actually. So it's a mixed bag. He always goes too far, right? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  So has Donald Trump used auto pen before as well? Yes. So it's like using the auto pen doesn't [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=85.92s)]
*  immediately mean that the world exploded and the president's not really the president, right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=91.44s)]
*  Did Joe Biden use it more? Yes. Did he seem to use it for some important [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  things that he probably should have signed himself? Yes. Should he be arrested for that? No, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=102.16s)]
*  no, okay. There's no need to get carried away. There's no need to, everybody's always threatening [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=108.4s)]
*  him with arrest. Now Steve Bannon is saying that Elon Musk should be arrested or deported. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=113.52s)]
*  We'll get to that story later in the show. It's breaking news as we're speaking right now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=120.64s)]
*  So stop arresting everyone, right? Okay, but if you want to investigate which ones were signed [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  by auto pen and did Joe Biden really sign off on those? That could be a legitimate investigation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Because I mean, here on The Young Turks, we were asking, while Biden was president, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  who's really making these decisions? Because he at times looked like he was totally and utterly [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=142.88s)]
*  out of it. So our theory was that Anthony Blinken was running foreign policy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=149.68s)]
*  And honestly, his wife, Jill Biden, was running a lot of domestic policy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=155.04s)]
*  And we're not just saying that, it's based on reporting from mainstream media outlets [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=159.92s)]
*  on different things that gave us that sense. Like for example, Jill Biden would sit in on [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=165.6s)]
*  interviews for cabinet members. I've never heard of a wife of a president doing that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=171.68s)]
*  Why is she helping to pick the cabinet? That was extraordinary. And there's many other [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  examples like that. And Blinken seemed firmly in charge of foreign policy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  So were they checking with the president? I hope so. I hope so. Was the president making [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  cognizant decisions? Well, you saw him at the debate. Did he seem cognizant in the debate? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  I don't know about that, right? So I don't think it's nothing, Sharon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=194.32s)]
*  I also don't like we don't need to go nuclear either. Let's just figure out what happened. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  And let's make sure to the best of our abilities that the president's charge. But again, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  one more thing, Sharon, was Ronald Reagan charged at the end of his presidency? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=208.48s)]
*  Do they check with the president on all these things? I don't get that sense at all. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  I think the bureaucracy runs a lot of the government. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=217.76s)]
*  Wow, wake up call. Let's get to this memo. Trump wrote to the Department of Justice. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=220.4s)]
*  In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  aides abused the power of presidential signatures through the use of an auto pen to conceal Biden's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=232.56s)]
*  cognitive decline and assert article to authority. This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=238.4s)]
*  and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=245.28s)]
*  from discovering who wielded the executive power all while Biden's signature was deployed across [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=250.16s)]
*  thousands of documents to affect radical policy shifts. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=255.44s)]
*  Today, Trump was asked to provide evidence for these claims about Biden's auto pen. Let's see [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=260.8s)]
*  what he had to say. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=266.56s)]
*  He really covered any evidence that anything specific was signed without President Biden's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=267.6s)]
*  knowledge or by other people in the administration acting illegally? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=273.36s)]
*  Well, I don't think Biden would know whether or not he signed it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=277.6s)]
*  I'm not asking if you've uncovered any of that information. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=280.0s)]
*  No, but I've uncovered the human mind. I was in a debate with the human mind [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  and I didn't think he knew what the hell he was doing. So it's just one of those things, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=287.36s)]
*  one of those problems. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  So never mind hypocrisy, Trump too has admitted he's used the auto pen as well. He claims that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  he only uses it for unimportant matters. Here's what he said about the auto pen today. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=300.24s)]
*  Do you know I sign important documents? Usually when they put documents in front of you, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=306.0s)]
*  they're important. Even if you're signing ambassadorships or anything, I consider that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  important. I think it's inappropriate. You have somebody that's devoting four years of their life [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  or more to being an ambassador. I think you really deserve, that person deserves to get a real [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=319.04s)]
*  signature, not an auto pen signature. Auto pen to me are used when thousands of letters come in from [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=324.0s)]
*  young people all over the country and you wanna get them back. And people use auto pens for that, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  to send a little signature at the bottom of a letter. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=334.48s)]
*  We have thousands of them. We get thousands of letters a week. And it's not possible to do, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  I'd like to do it myself, but you can't do it. To me, that's where auto pens start and stop. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  All right, so Trump making the distinction there. Joe Biden responded to the auto pen allegations. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=351.6s)]
*  Let me be clear, I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardon, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  executive orders, legislation and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=368.23999999999995s)]
*  false. This is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and congressional Republicans [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=375.2s)]
*  who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra wealthy and big [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=385.44s)]
*  corporations. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=392.08s)]
*  Please. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=393.04s)]
*  No, well, yeah, these two sides, are they that different? But there's some who will already say [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=394.16s)]
*  that Biden didn't write that response. But go ahead, weigh in on Trump and his response to what [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=401.92s)]
*  is appropriate, when it's appropriate to use the auto pen jank and Biden's response. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=408.56s)]
*  Yeah, when I watch Trump speak, I feel like I'm watching a baby wrestle with his food. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=413.92s)]
*  Right, what are you doing, brother? You had him at, hey, who used the auto pen for him? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=423.68s)]
*  But instead he goes, if some things are unimportant, you could do with an auto pen. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=429.12s)]
*  Wait a minute, what do you think is unimportant? What have you done with an auto pen that you [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=432.64s)]
*  don't even know because you think that category is unimportant? You don't even know it because [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=437.68s)]
*  you said that basically you're saying it's so unimportant you didn't bother checking. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=442.56s)]
*  That could be worse. Biden's at least saying that he checked and he made the decisions. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=447.84s)]
*  And then by the way, Helen 007, one of our members on tyt.com said, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=453.76s)]
*  Biden had the auto pen, Trump has Stephen Miller. So that's also a fair point. Who do you think [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=457.6s)]
*  is doing the policy, Blinken or Biden? My guess is Blinken. Who do you think is doing the policy, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=464.48s)]
*  Stephen Miller or Donald Trump? My guess is Stephen Miller, right? So [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=469.36s)]
*  that's why he's gotta know when to stop talking, but he definitely doesn't. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=475.92s)]
*  And then I was amused by the Biden line of like, that's why the Republicans are helping the ultra [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=481.36s)]
*  wealthy in corporations. Come on, brother, what did you do? What did you do? Come on. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=486.64s)]
*  So don't tell me about how, yeah, the Republicans are serving the rich. Yes, that's definitely true. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=492.48s)]
*  But the Democrats didn't do any better. That's why you got your ass handed to you. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=497.04s)]
*  And now Democratic leadership sitting at 19% because the Democratic establishment got caught [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=501.12s)]
*  basically serving the donor class. So it just rings so hollow. And Sharon, it's a great point. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=506.32s)]
*  I mean, who auto penned that statement for Biden? Did Biden really write that himself? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=512.0s)]
*  But that goes to the larger point I made earlier too, which is, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=516.96s)]
*  none of these people write their own statements. When Trump's talking, the reason why people [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=520.72s)]
*  believe he's authentic, even though he is almost always lies in some way, shape or form, right? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=525.36s)]
*  He throws in a whole bunch of lies. They're eating the cats and the dogs, etc. But he doesn't sound [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=533.04s)]
*  like a robot. He sounds like a real person, right? But in terms of like, who's making the policies and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=537.52s)]
*  etc. They're basically all at the end of the day, let the donors win. They let the donors [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=546.24s)]
*  control everything. And the reason the bureaucracy runs things, because they know [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=551.36s)]
*  which donors helped and which ones they gotta pay back. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=558.9599999999999s)]
*  And they know all of those details. But Trump spends most of his time golfing and watching Fox [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=562.48s)]
*  News. Biden spent most of his time napping. So that's why the presidency does make some [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=567.92s)]
*  important decisions, no question. Like Donald Trump made the decisions on tariffs that no one [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  else would have, right? So that's fair. Joe Biden did say yes, we will serve Israel and we [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=579.6s)]
*  will never question them, right? Those are important decisions. Yes, I'm taking out $15 [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=584.72s)]
*  minimum wage. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do paid family leave. I'm not doing public option. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=588.88s)]
*  Those are important decisions for the president. But overall, other than those big giant decisions, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=592.96s)]
*  no, on a day to day basis, they don't really run the country. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=598.48s)]
*  And we should all be aware of that by now. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=601.28s)]
*  swing. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZFmEVskGE&t=606.72s)]
