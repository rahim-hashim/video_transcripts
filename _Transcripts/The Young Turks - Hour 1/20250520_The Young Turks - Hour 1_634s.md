"ALEX JONES (HOST): Now that said, it would take hours to go over how ridiculously obvious the murder of Jeffrey Epstein was in that federal jail in New York. I mean, the coroner said his neck was broken in three spots. It would take a gorilla to do that. And the cameras all turned off magically. Now we're learning that they put nitrous oxide in from good sources and made the guards pass out."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Kash Patel and Dan Bongino betray MAGA
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE)
*  There's three things don't hang [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=0.0s)]
*  themselves. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=1.74s)]
*  Christmas tree lights, drywall and [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=2.5s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein as Senator Kennedy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  rightfully said. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=7.5s)]
*  Here's a clip of Cash and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=9.48s)]
*  Dan Bongino making fools out of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=10.98s)]
*  themselves. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=12.88s)]
*  You know a suicide when you see one [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  and that's what that was. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=15.72s)]
*  They killed themselves. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=17.84s)]
*  For once, I find agreement with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Alex Jones, especially in regard to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=23.2s)]
*  that hostage video that FBI [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=25.72s)]
*  Director Cash Patel and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=27.62s)]
*  FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=29.14s)]
*  appeared in where they declared [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=31.220000000000002s)]
*  that no, it's simple. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=33.34s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein wasn't killed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=35.82s)]
*  It was definitely a suicide. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=37.06s)]
*  Yeah, it was definitely, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=41.06s)]
*  is that what I'm saying? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  Definitely a suicide. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=43.38s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=45.02s)]
*  But even your mockery of them was [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=45.82s)]
*  more human than what they look [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=47.46s)]
*  like. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=49.14s)]
*  They look terrified. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=49.64s)]
*  They look terrified and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=50.46s)]
*  the hostage video is a great way of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=51.7s)]
*  putting it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=53.46s)]
*  But they look like zombies, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  they were somehow infected with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=56.46s)]
*  a virus and they're like, no, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=58.38s)]
*  we are fine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=60.38s)]
*  Everything is good. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=61.86s)]
*  I almost wanted to take a picture [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=63.02s)]
*  with a flash on it and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  then scream get out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=65.38s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=66.54s)]
*  So basically, of course, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=67.86s)]
*  this story has to do with the Epstein [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=70.26s)]
*  files, Epstein tapes specifically. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  And this notion that Jeffrey [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=77.98s)]
*  Epstein wasn't killed, that he did [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=79.7s)]
*  in fact commit suicide while he was [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=81.7s)]
*  imprisoned. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=83.62s)]
*  So why are Patel and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=84.86s)]
*  Bongino so convinced that Epstein [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=86.06s)]
*  committed suicide? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=88.22s)]
*  Well, let's see what they had to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=89.62s)]
*  say. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=91.1s)]
*  You said Jeffrey Epstein committed [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=92.78s)]
*  suicide. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=95.34s)]
*  People don't believe it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=96.98s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, they have [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=98.1s)]
*  a right to their opinion. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=99.98s)]
*  But as someone who has worked as [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=102.06s)]
*  a public defender, as a prosecutor [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=103.62s)]
*  who's been in that prison system, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=105.22s)]
*  who's been in the Metropolitan [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=106.78s)]
*  Detention Center, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=108.18s)]
*  who's been in segregated housing, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=109.14s)]
*  you know a suicide when you see one [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=110.98s)]
*  and that's what that was. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=112.78s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=115.1s)]
*  Again, you want me to, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=116.7s)]
*  I've seen the whole file. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=118.06s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=119.94s)]
*  Wait, what was the point about [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=123.5s)]
*  segregated housing? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=125.66s)]
*  What? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=127.98s)]
*  What? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=128.48s)]
*  Is there a lot of suicides by, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=129.98s)]
*  I mean, by anyone in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=132.38s)]
*  segregated housing? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=134.1s)]
*  That was a crazy statement to make. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=136.74s)]
*  But okay, I don't believe it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=140.5s)]
*  I personally don't believe it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=142.5s)]
*  Alex Jones doesn't believe it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=144.74s)]
*  So I guess we're both tin hat [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  conspiracy theorists. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  He says overall, I think Cash [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=150.94s)]
*  Patel and Dan Bongino are doing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=152.06s)]
*  a great job. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=153.62s)]
*  But on this claim that Epstein's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=154.22s)]
*  death is not a cover up, I call BS. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  Now the next day Jones slammed [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=159.18s)]
*  Patel and Bongino on his show. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=161.06s)]
*  Let's take a look at what he had [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  to say. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=164.46s)]
*  It would take hours to go over how [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  ridiculously obvious the murder of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=169.22s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein was in that federal [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=172.26000000000002s)]
*  jail in New York. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the coroner said his neck [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=178.54000000000002s)]
*  was broken in three spots. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=180.3s)]
*  It would take a gorilla to do that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  And the cameras all turned off [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=187.10000000000002s)]
*  magically. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=189.10000000000002s)]
*  You've seen the files. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=189.94s)]
*  The files you were given? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  Why couldn't they just say they're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=196.82s)]
*  investigating it? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=198.3s)]
*  I mean, come on, guys. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=199.94s)]
*  Come on, please. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=203.1s)]
*  And Alex Jones is the only one [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=206.5s)]
*  who's doubting that Epstein's death [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=208.3s)]
*  was the result of suicide. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=210.62s)]
*  In fact, Tucker Carlson also called [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=212.58s)]
*  out Patel and Bongino during [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=214.9s)]
*  an interview with Sean Ryan, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=216.70000000000002s)]
*  who's a former Navy SEAL and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  Blackwater contractor. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=220.28s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=222.10000000000002s)]
*  Of course, it's not a democracy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=224.22s)]
*  Of course, the system is rigged. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=225.9s)]
*  It's fake, because no matter who [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=227.82s)]
*  gets elected, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=229.94s)]

*  no, it's okay, I've seen the files. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=285.46000000000004s)]

*  not going to fly at all with anyone. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=319.94s)]
*  Especially as you're sweating [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=323.42s)]
*  bullets. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=324.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=325.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=326.2s)]
*  No, he's okay. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=326.7s)]
*  No, we are sure that he committed [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=327.78s)]
*  suicide and it was not. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=329.62s)]
*  I mean, we're sure, we're sure. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=330.94s)]
*  Yeah, okay, yeah, whatever, dude. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=333.62s)]
*  So now, guys, why are we agreeing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=335.58s)]
*  with these guys that we normally [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=337.74s)]
*  never agree with, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=339.74s)]
*  Because this one's obvious. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=342.29999999999995s)]
*  So why is it obvious? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=344.06s)]
*  Now, if you're like, because [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=346.02s)]
*  there's a group who doesn't agree [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=347.38s)]
*  with us. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=348.9s)]
*  And so those are the establishment [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  folks, the mainstream media guys [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=351.02s)]
*  and stuff. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  Like they see conversations like [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=353.14s)]
*  this, of course, Alex Jones and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=354.7s)]
*  young Turks, and other girls, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=356.58s)]
*  they think that he didn't hang [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=358.46s)]
*  himself, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=360.17999999999995s)]
*  Okay, yeah, you can do that all you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=361.78s)]
*  want, but I said it ahead of time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=364.26s)]
*  And here's what I mean by that, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  and it's on tape. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=368.53999999999996s)]
*  I said, the day that Epstein was [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=370.34s)]
*  killed, we were on the air. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=372.05999999999995s)]
*  And I said, look, guys, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  I hear the guards were off and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=374.94s)]
*  his roommate had been taken out. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=376.46s)]
*  But if you're going to commit [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=378.5s)]
*  suicide, you might take [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=379.82s)]
*  the opportunity when your guards [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=380.97999999999996s)]
*  have been taken out. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=382.61999999999995s)]
*  And when you see maybe the guards [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=383.85999999999996s)]
*  are away, I don't know how he could [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=385.41999999999996s)]
*  see that, but maybe he saw it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  And your roommate's gone, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=388.58s)]
*  that's a good opportunity. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=389.61999999999995s)]
*  So I said, the way we'll know is if [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=390.65999999999997s)]
*  the video in the hallway was [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=392.73999999999995s)]
*  working or not. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=394.53999999999996s)]
*  If it was working and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=396.05999999999995s)]
*  you see no one in the hallway, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=397.09999999999997s)]
*  well, then he hung himself. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=398.82s)]
*  And so I mean, it seems unlikely, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=400.09999999999997s)]
*  but that's what happened, right? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=402.14s)]
*  If the video camera in the hallway [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  isn't working, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=406.46s)]
*  there's no chance he hung himself. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=407.38s)]
*  It was definitely somebody [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=409.82s)]
*  killing him. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=411.02s)]
*  And I said that before we found out [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=411.78s)]
*  about the video camera. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=413.9s)]
*  And now we find out, golly gee, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=415.61999999999995s)]
*  not only were the guards asleep, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=418.38s)]
*  and his neck was broken in three [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=421.26s)]
*  places, and his roommate had just [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=424.05999999999995s)]
*  been taken away. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=427.14000000000004s)]
*  But the video camera, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=428.42s)]
*  what a bad break, not working. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=429.86s)]
*  No, no, you can look, if you're in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=432.34000000000003s)]
*  the establishment and you're like, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=434.22s)]
*  yeah, Lee Harvey Oswald was [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=436.14000000000004s)]
*  this lone shooter. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=437.58000000000004s)]
*  I believe everything the government [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=438.66s)]

*  right? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=453.86s)]
*  That's called mainstream media [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6hClBx2YfE&t=454.46000000000004s)]
