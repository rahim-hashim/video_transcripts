"I am one of hundreds of security contractors who have been in Gaza to facilitate aid under the new US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation project.
And it‚Äôs all bulls--t.
I joined what sounded like a good mission, with good pay ‚Äì through a company called UG Solutions. We were given little information."

# Whistleblower Unveils How The U.S. Is SCREWING Over Desperate People Of Gaza
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA)
*  120 people were killed in a 24-hour period from Tuesday to Wednesday, including dozens [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=0.0s)]
*  who were shot while trying to get food from aid distribution sites. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=6.76s)]
*  There were 41 people, according to hospital officials, killed on Wednesday in two separate [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=11.24s)]
*  incidents, one in central Gaza and one in the south. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=16.64s)]
*  The hospital officials said they were shot while trying to get food parcels. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=20.6s)]
*  The Israeli military says it's aware of one incident in which troops fired upon people [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=25.12s)]
*  approaching them in darkness overnight. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=29.88s)]
*  Now that the United Nations organization known as UNRWA is no longer allowed to provide humanitarian [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=35.28s)]
*  aid to the people of Gaza following Israel's defamation of the entirety of said organization. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=40.32s)]
*  Turns out that there is disaster after disaster with the organization that is now replacing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=47.68s)]
*  UNRWA. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Of course, that's known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, an American security contractor is blowing the whistle on this US slash Israeli backed [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=58.32s)]
*  organization. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=65.8s)]
*  And what this person reveals is explosive to say the least. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=68.16s)]
*  But before we get to those details, I just want to remind the American people that you're [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=72.56s)]
*  funding this, you're funding this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=78.08s)]
*  And Bassem Youssef, who was on Piers Morgan show today, I think described the predicament [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=82.36s)]
*  that Americans are currently in perfectly. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Why is my money, why is hurricane relief funds in America are going to fund Israel? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Also I don't understand the relationship between America and Israel. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=101.0s)]
*  It's like it's the most effed up situation ever. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=104.64s)]
*  We're like the world's most pathetic sugar daddy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=108.04s)]
*  We give them billions of dollars and they on us. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=110.88s)]
*  Like Mr. Jonathan said, now we're ganging on them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  We're not helpful. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  Dude, we gave you $30 billion to bomb children and it's not enough for you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=117.32s)]
*  Like, I mean, at least when you pay a dominatrix, you know that you're getting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=122.24s)]
*  But this is just America having a public humiliation king while getting, and they call this foreign [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=127.24s)]
*  policy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=132.16s)]
*  They are arresting American students on American soils for protesting Israeli war crimes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=133.16s)]
*  What the hell man? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=138.68s)]
*  This is like your crack whore making you beat your children for calling her what she is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=139.68s)]
*  a whore. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=144.92s)]
*  The thing, this is what really boggles me in America. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=146.6s)]
*  The right and the left, they fight each other tooth and nail over gun control, education, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  minorities right, healthcare, DEI. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=155.2s)]
*  But when it comes to Israel, everybody competes to be Israel favorite bitch. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  I couldn't have said it better myself. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  Now with that in mind, let's go to this piece that was written by the American security [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  contractor. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  This person is blowing the whistle anonymously and wrote the piece for Zateo. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=171.54s)]
*  It's titled exclusive American security contractor unloads on US Israeli Gaza humanitarian foundation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=176.7s)]
*  Quote, I thought I was signing up for an aid mission, but what I've witnessed in Gaza is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=183.14s)]
*  horrific. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=189.78s)]
*  So this individual writes that he or she is one of hundreds of security contractors who [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=191.78s)]
*  have been in Gaza to facilitate aid under the new US backed Gaza humanitarian foundation [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  project. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  And it's all BS. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  Now they confirm exactly what I had been outlining about this project. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=208.82000000000002s)]
*  I talked about it on Pierce Morgan show. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=217.3s)]
*  I talked about how Palestinians who are desperate and hungry who go to these humanitarian aid [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=219.46s)]
*  hubs in order to get food and water get shot at. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=224.58s)]
*  And I think that it's being done intentionally. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=229.06s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=231.62s)]
*  This piece kind of confirms it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=232.82s)]
*  So here she writes, the higher ups claim the Israeli military is not involved, but it feels [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=234.26s)]
*  like they're the man behind the curtain. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=240.66s)]
*  Sure, they're not on site with us, but their snipers and tanks are just hundreds of meters [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=243.54s)]
*  away. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=248.82s)]
*  You can hear them shooting all day. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=249.62s)]
*  We were monitoring an empty site all day. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=252.82s)]
*  Sometime after dark, dozens of flatbed trucks finally brought aid. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=255.94s)]
*  The Israeli military soon radioed in that 200 to 300 civilians, a couple of kilometers, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=260.82s)]
*  less than two miles north were approaching. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=268.5s)]
*  We then observed an Israeli drone go out there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=272.02s)]
*  Shortly thereafter, the area started getting lit up with artillery. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=276.98s)]
*  Maybe the Israelis were firing between our position and the people in order to keep them [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=282.74s)]
*  from moving forward. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't think that's the case. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=290.42s)]
*  After all, tanks fire all day long near these aid sites. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=291.78s)]
*  Snipers fire from what used to be a hospital. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=296.74s)]
*  Bombs and bullets fly all day long in one direction toward Palestinians. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=301.14s)]
*  We know the Israeli military has been enforcing curfews in some parts of Gaza. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=308.34s)]
*  I would not be surprised if the aid was delivered at night deliberately, given it would then draw [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=312.98s)]
*  people out, at which point they could be fired on as combatants, even though they weren't. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=319.86s)]
*  It's very clear that the Israeli military will take any opportunity available to fire. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=327.3s)]
*  This is an American contractor. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=333.38s)]
*  This is an American contractor. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=335.7s)]
*  And I don't blame this individual for not wanting to release their identity, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=340.02s)]
*  given the kinds of threats I personally have seen from IDF soldiers toward me for speaking my mind, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  which I will continue to do because I'm not afraid of them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=350.82s)]
*  But nonetheless, this is an American contractor who's been on the ground, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  who got hired specifically to help deliver aid in the context of Gaza and the fact that these [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=357.78s)]
*  people have been starved for months and continue to be. There are more details that were shared [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  in this piece that I think you should read about. I'll give you a few of them. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=371.14s)]
*  So this contractor writes that prior to their departure to Gaza, the American contractor says [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=375.38s)]
*  that they were told they would be joining a good mission without providing any details. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=380.02s)]
*  They're then sent to Washington DC where they're given a little more details, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=385.3s)]
*  but very little information about the logistics, how they're supposed to carry out their duties. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=388.98s)]
*  And individuals who are not qualified were hired to be part of this, by the way. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  They write, some folks seemed way too old. It seemed like the company was so short on personnel [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=399.54s)]
*  that they weren't picky about who they allowed in on this. We were eventually each issued an AR [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=405.14s)]
*  style rifle as well as a pistol sidearm. But no one was tested to ensure they had proper training. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=412.02s)]
*  Some of us were also given machine guns. They also write that there were some non-lethal weapons [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=420.9s)]
*  provided as well. Things like flash grenades, pepper spray. But they also write that we're [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=429.06s)]
*  talking about people who don't have access to water, meaning the Palestinians, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=437.85999999999996s)]
*  and we're ready to spray them in the face with pepper spray. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=442.41999999999996s)]
*  Why would we do that? They're just trying to get aid. We're there to give them aid. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=446.17999999999995s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. The contractors are allegedly working 20 hour days [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  with no days off. That's also according to this piece. They're also not getting fed while they're [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=458.73999999999995s)]
*  in Gaza. Instead, they're getting a stipend and they're being told, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=464.26s)]
*  just go to a grocery store in Israel and get food when your shift is up. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=468.26s)]
*  Your 20 hour shift is up and you're probably exhausted and desperately need to sleep. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=472.74s)]
*  Some weeks they literally have no days off according to this individual's claims. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  And when it came to delivering aid, the group was overwhelmed with desperate people. But they say, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUIdvOufkA&t=485.38s)]
