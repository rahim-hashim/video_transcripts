# MAGA Hates The New Pope - May 8, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74)
*  Welcome to the on tour, it's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=0.0s)]
*  Cenk Uygur, Brett Ehrlich with you [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2.0s)]
*  guys. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=4.28s)]
*  Do we have a little bit of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=4.82s)]
*  a habemus popum situation? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=6.26s)]
*  We do, habemus popum like popcorn. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=8.02s)]
*  We got new popes everywhere. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=12.18s)]
*  Thank God, God's dad, God's son, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=13.9s)]
*  God himself, and the ghost God. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=16.22s)]
*  They all got a new pope today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=18.22s)]
*  All right, I hear that, yeah, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=20.38s)]
*  the Holy Ghost is super psyched. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=22.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=25.18s)]
*  Okay, so now we have that story for [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=25.68s)]
*  you guys, he's obviously a Marxist, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=28.24s)]
*  we'll explain. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  And then a little bit later, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  more internal fighting between [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=33.76s)]
*  the Republicans. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  And this is not like the old days [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=38.12s)]
*  where they had the fake fights and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=39.64s)]
*  they just pushed over to the right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=41.16s)]
*  These are real fights, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=43.22s)]
*  they're bloody. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=44.9s)]
*  And I don't know who's going to win [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=46.56s)]
*  them, and I don't know what [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=49.08s)]
*  the end game is. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  It is super interesting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  So chaos is broken out, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  you're not surprised by that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=55.46s)]
*  But that portion of the chaos, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=57.64s)]
*  it's got some upsides, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  at least for the rest of us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  All right, having said that, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=63.32s)]
*  let's hit it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  All right, let's do it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=65.72s)]
*  A new pope has been chosen, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=66.92s)]
*  that's right. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=68.84s)]
*  And MAGA is very unhappy about it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=69.8s)]
*  I love the idea of being mad about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=72.72s)]
*  the pope. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=74.84s)]
*  Here are the details, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=76.12s)]
*  his name is Pope Leo XIV. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=77.36s)]
*  And he is officially the first [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=79.0s)]
*  American pope. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=80.92s)]
*  He's from Chicago, Illinois. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=82.32s)]
*  His original name, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=84.56s)]
*  before he changed it, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=85.64s)]
*  because you got to as the pope, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=86.86s)]
*  was Cardinal Robert Prevost. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=88.62s)]
*  Pope Leo is not just from America, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=90.94s)]
*  he also has some strong opinions on [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  American politics. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  And that's triggered a ton of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=96.58s)]
*  right wingers we have a lot to talk [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=97.78s)]
*  about, we'll get to it momentarily. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=99.26s)]
*  But Cenk, what are your first [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=100.78s)]
*  reactions to the Pope of America? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=102.14s)]
*  I am a little disappointed they [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=103.9s)]
*  picked a Marxist. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=105.58000000000001s)]
*  And we'll explain to you guys all [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=106.78s)]
*  the different ways that he is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=108.98s)]
*  And you'll be shocked. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=111.26s)]
*  Well, if we prove that you would be [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  shocked. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=116.34s)]
*  So second of all, they said they [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=116.84s)]
*  got a pope from Chicago, Illinois. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=118.44s)]
*  I was like, Rick Strom, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=120.16s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=121.56s)]
*  But TYT sports is losing in value. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=123.04s)]
*  And then I found out it was [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=125.36s)]
*  Prevost, this close, okay? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=126.78s)]
*  So, young Turks are so old, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=128.52s)]
*  we're on to our fourth pope. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=131.68s)]
*  We started this 24 years ago. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=136.36s)]
*  This is our third or [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  fourth habemus popum, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=140.32s)]
*  depending on how you count [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=141.84s)]
*  Benedict and Francis. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=143.38s)]
*  because they were double quarter [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=144.58s)]
*  pounder and cheese for a while. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=146.38s)]
*  I don't know if I can say that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=147.98s)]
*  about the pope, but apparently you [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=149.26s)]
*  can say anything you want is we're [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=150.7s)]
*  going to see from the right wing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=152.06s)]
*  here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=153.44s)]
*  So lots of news about the pope. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=153.94s)]
*  And then I've got my thoughts and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=156.02s)]
*  I know why MAGA is upset. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=157.98s)]
*  And I want to help them with their [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  tears a little bit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  Yes, great, fantastic. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=162.98000000000002s)]
*  This is what originally the pope [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=165.62s)]
*  tweeted on X, he retweeted this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=169.9s)]
*  He said JD Vance is wrong, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=174.78s)]
*  Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  love for others. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=179.7s)]
*  That's something that apparently [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  JD Vance said, it's your family [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=183.18s)]
*  first, and it's you then your [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=184.9s)]
*  family, then your community. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  And the pope, who knows this stuff [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=187.82s)]
*  for sure, pointed out that is not [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=189.86s)]
*  the case. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=191.74s)]
*  I quote, this is what JD Vance said, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  there's a Christian concept that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=194.58s)]
*  you love your family and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=196.46s)]
*  then you love your neighbor and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=197.66s)]
*  then you love your community and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=199.1s)]
*  then you love your fellow citizens. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=200.62s)]
*  And then after that, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  a lot of the far left has [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=203.56s)]
*  completely inverted that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  JD, check your sources, I did, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  what you're talking about is from [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=208.76s)]
*  Scientology. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=210.56s)]
*  Here's a graphic from the book of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=211.2s)]
*  Scientology that says this is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=212.72s)]
*  exactly what the Scientologists [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=214.12s)]
*  believe, you dildo. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=215.84s)]
*  It's amazing, that's from my copy [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  of Scientology, no joke. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=219.44s)]
*  Pope Leo has also criticized Trump [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=221.28s)]
*  and his policies, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=223.44s)]
*  he posted this article in 2015. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=224.64s)]
*  Cardinal Dolan colon, why Donald [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=226.84s)]
*  Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric is [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=229.44s)]
*  so problematic. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=232.82s)]
*  And last month, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=234.54s)]
*  Pope Leo reposted this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=235.42s)]
*  As Trump and Bukele use oval to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=236.86s)]
*  laugh at feds illicit deportation [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=239.18s)]
*  of a US resident, once an [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=241.86s)]
*  undocumented Salvadorian himself, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=243.7s)]
*  now DC, Ox and Avellio asks, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=246.7s)]
*  do you not see the suffering? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=249.06s)]
*  Is your conscience not disturbed? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=251.46s)]
*  How can you stay quiet? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  Those posts and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=257.46s)]

*  Marxist. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=433.86s)]
*  So first of all, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=435.3s)]
*  there was a guy who was a Marxist [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=436.06s)]
*  who's religious to be fair. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=437.3s)]
*  His name was Jesus Christ. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=438.7s)]
*  He said give away all of your [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=440.94s)]

*  I'd say that's kind of fair. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=450.74s)]
*  There's a lot of quotes in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=453.14s)]
*  the Bible where he says literally [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=454.38s)]

*  Okay, so that's good. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=461.5s)]
*  But did the Pope say anything like [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=462.71999999999997s)]

*  I know why they're complaining. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=486.68s)]

*  speak up at some point because they [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=808.14s)]
*  are, because the leader of [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=810.12s)]
*  the Republican Party in the most [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=811.66s)]
*  powerful country in the world is so [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=813.5s)]
*  non-Christian. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=815.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to come back to [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=816.96s)]
*  Trump for a second. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=818.0s)]
*  But it's as if we then saw this guy [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=818.76s)]
*  and we were like, my God, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=821.32s)]
*  I can't believe the pope is [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=823.36s)]
*  anti-choice. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=825.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's not that surprising, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=826.2s)]
*  right? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=828.76s)]
*  We're used to popes being [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=829.64s)]
*  conservative, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=830.84s)]
*  But the pope appears to be pretty [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=832.28s)]
*  anti-LGBTQ, especially if you look [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=834.28s)]
*  at his past sayings. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=836.28s)]
*  That's not that surprising, right? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=838.24s)]
*  There's a bear, no, not, right? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=840.22s)]
*  And so, and he might have been part [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=842.02s)]
*  of a cover up of abuse. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=845.66s)]
*  Like, if you're on the left, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=849.06s)]
*  you have to accept that a huge [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=851.02s)]
*  percentage of religious leaders [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=852.84s)]
*  will be massively conservative, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=854.8s)]
*  right? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=856.84s)]
*  And then even the ones that are not [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=857.7s)]
*  massively conservative will have [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=859.42s)]
*  deeply conservative positions. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=861.06s)]
*  So we're used to it. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=862.82s)]
*  That's why we don't catch the kind [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=864.14s)]
*  of feelings that the right wing is [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=865.58s)]
*  catching. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=866.94s)]
*  Or otherwise, we'd be like, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=867.8s)]
*  this filthy capitalist pope. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=870.04s)]
*  I mean, economic system has [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  nothing to do with it, right? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=875.66s)]
*  So you just want to smear everyone [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=878.16s)]
*  as Marxist no matter what they do. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=880.12s)]
*  And they feel entitled to a pope of [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=882.0s)]
*  their liking, which is not an [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=884.36s)]
*  entitlement that any of us have [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=886.6s)]
*  gotten used to. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=888.64s)]
*  So that's why you have this [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=889.76s)]
*  disparate reaction when he has what [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=891.36s)]
*  some would consider progressive [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=893.56s)]
*  positions and [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=895.4399999999999s)]
*  some certainly conservative [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=896.5s)]
*  positions, right? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=898.1s)]
*  So we should be a tie, but [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=899.42s)]
*  it doesn't feel like a tie, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=900.98s)]
*  because they feel entitled to [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=902.38s)]
*  a 100% win. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=903.8199999999999s)]
*  And the one thing I keep forgetting [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=905.02s)]
*  is Catholics are one in five [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=907.02s)]
*  Americans, right? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=908.5799999999999s)]
*  But most Christians are not [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=909.78s)]
*  Catholic in America. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=911.9399999999999s)]
*  So when Lindsey Graham was like, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=913.9399999999999s)]
*  we should let Trump be the pope. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=915.6999999999999s)]
*  And Trump was like, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=917.5s)]
*  I'd love to be the pope. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=918.3399999999999s)]
*  Neither of them is Catholic. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=919.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's another thing I was [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=921.5s)]
*  going to get to, Brett. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=922.9399999999999s)]
*  So I mean, get a load of this. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=924.1s)]
*  So I'm going to quote one more for [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=925.3199999999999s)]
*  you, but there's literally dozens [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=927.1999999999999s)]
*  of these in the Bible, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=929.3599999999999s)]
*  including in the New Testament. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=930.64s)]
*  Deuteronomy 27 19, cursed is anyone [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=932.56s)]
*  who withholds justice from the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=935.92s)]
*  foreigner, the fatherless or [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=938.68s)]
*  the widow, that all the people [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=941.5999999999999s)]
*  shall say, amen, amen. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=944.4399999999999s)]
*  Cursed is anyone who withholds [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=946.88s)]
*  justice from the foreigner. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=949.52s)]
*  Now, are you sure you're all, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=952.4399999999999s)]
*  if you're on the right, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=954.9s)]
*  you sure you're all being good [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=955.96s)]
*  Christians? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=957.1s)]
*  You sure you're following [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=957.98s)]
*  the Bible? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=958.82s)]
*  Have you read the Bible in a while [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=960.02s)]
*  or have you had a preacher tell you [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=961.26s)]
*  what the Bible is? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=962.7s)]
*  Yeah, Deuteronomy 13, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=964.14s)]
*  I shall have a private jet. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=965.66s)]
*  I'd read the actual Bible if I was [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=968.1s)]
*  you, because you might be shocked [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=969.66s)]
*  at what's in it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=971.1800000000001s)]
*  And so that's the actual Bible. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=972.42s)]
*  Then Trump comes along and [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=975.38s)]
*  he's like, I'm Presbyterian, but [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=976.7s)]
*  so what, I'd like to be pope. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=978.34s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to be pope. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=980.0600000000001s)]
*  Imagine if Biden said he was going [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=981.58s)]
*  to be the pope and did an AI picture [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=983.12s)]
*  of him dressed as the pope. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=984.96s)]
*  You guys, you all know it, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=987.4s)]
*  the entire right wing would be like, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=988.88s)]
*  how dare you, we have never been so [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=991.0s)]
*  rendered in our lives, right? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=993.28s)]
*  Let alone if someone who was not [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=995.24s)]
*  Christian at all did it, like [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=997.2s)]
*  Trump, what's your favorite verse [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=999.0s)]
*  in the Bible? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1001.16s)]
*  Do I like all of them? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1002.0s)]
*  Would you like the whole [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1003.28s)]
*  testament or new testament? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1004.72s)]
*  Do I like both? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1006.44s)]
*  I like both, he's never read a word [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1007.64s)]
*  of it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1009.88s)]
*  You're praying to an orange Jesus, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1010.44s)]
*  come on guys, it's like get real. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1012.42s)]
*  Or you can say, you know what, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1014.5s)]
*  you're right, I'm an atheist now. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1016.4599999999999s)]
*  I didn't believe anything in [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1018.54s)]
*  the Bible, I just want money, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1019.9599999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1021.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think Trump's going to help [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1021.98s)]
*  me with money or Trump's going to [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1023.5s)]
*  help me with getting rid of [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1024.9s)]
*  immigrants or whatever. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1025.9s)]
*  Yeah, I don't care what Jesus said [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1027.1399999999999s)]
*  about immigrants and [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1028.78s)]
*  the needy and giving away yourself. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1029.7s)]
*  I'm not giving anything away, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1031.46s)]
*  screw Jesus, I'm with Trump. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1032.66s)]
*  Okay, that's fine, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1034.1s)]
*  at least you're being honest then. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1034.86s)]
*  Okay, and then finally, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1036.5s)]
*  I think we should pick new pope [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1037.78s)]
*  names, okay? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1039.06s)]
*  You don't like Leo? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1040.1200000000001s)]
*  I feel Leo is pretty informal. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1041.4s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm saying since if you [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1043.0s)]
*  get elected pope or selected pope, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1045.0400000000002s)]
*  you have to pick a new pope name, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1047.2s)]
*  we should all pick pope names. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1049.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1051.2s)]
*  So I just, right as you were [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1052.64s)]
*  talking, I wrote down two of them, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1054.1200000000001s)]
*  one for Trump, Pope Robert Barron [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1056.16s)]
*  the 13th. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1058.5600000000002s)]
*  Robert. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1059.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1060.64s)]

*  planet speak different languages is [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1098.6s)]
*  actually, if you listen to the Bible, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1100.58s)]

*  Real estate developers who built [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1104.52s)]

*  It was called the Tower of Babel. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1111.76s)]
*  And that's why we say babble like [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1114.0s)]
*  we don't understand you because God [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1115.4s)]
*  cursed everyone to speak different [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1116.92s)]

*  We'll have it all very conclusive, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1241.14s)]
*  but the actual deal is a very [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1243.14s)]
*  conclusive one. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1244.74s)]
*  We think just about everything's [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1245.9s)]

*  So today Donald Trump announced [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1250.46s)]
*  that he has reached a trade [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1252.16s)]
*  agreement with the United Kingdom. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1253.6200000000001s)]
*  But is it a good deal? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1256.0800000000002s)]
*  We will let you know. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1257.68s)]
*  We'll show you one Trump cabinet [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1258.92s)]
*  member who wildly embarrassed [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1261.2s)]
*  himself with how excited he was [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1263.3600000000001s)]
*  about this deal being made. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1265.5600000000002s)]

*  the details. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1269.96s)]
*  But first, Cenk, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1270.68s)]
*  your reaction to the story. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1271.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's not really a deal. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1272.3600000000001s)]
*  There is a part of it that is real. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1273.6000000000001s)]
*  We'll tell you which part that is. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1275.3600000000001s)]
*  But it's microscopic. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1277.1200000000001s)]
*  And so this is mainly Trump going, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1279.4s)]
*  we got a great deal, everybody, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1281.8600000000001s)]
*  don't worry about it. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1283.46s)]
*  But the way the stock market [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1284.7s)]
*  reacted was curious to me. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1286.22s)]
*  So let's show you what a non deal [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1288.18s)]
*  it is, so you have the right [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1290.38s)]
*  context for, yes, but [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1292.26s)]
*  what's going to happen next? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1293.78s)]
*  Because my theory is disaster is [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1295.94s)]

*  Let's see if I'm right. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1299.3s)]
*  Okay, so a lot of you might know [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1301.18s)]
*  that remember that Trump slapped [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1302.98s)]
*  all these tariffs on a bunch of [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1304.8600000000001s)]
*  different countries on what he [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1306.44s)]
*  called Liberation Day. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1308.14s)]
*  Here's what trade with the UK looked [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1310.12s)]
*  like before Liberation Day. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1312.48s)]
*  The US carried $11.9 billion trade [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1314.36s)]
*  surplus in goods with the UK in [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1317.28s)]
*  2024, which ranked the UK as [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1319.76s)]
*  the fifth highest surplus among all [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1322.08s)]
*  trade partners. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1324.96s)]
*  But very important to say that [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1327.0s)]
*  the United Kingdom was not one of [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1328.8s)]
*  the countries that faced those [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1330.8799999999999s)]
*  broad reciprocal tariffs, okay? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1332.72s)]
*  It was not one of the countries on [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1335.08s)]
*  the bulletin board. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1337.08s)]
*  However, it was subject to [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1338.74s)]
*  the universal 10% import tariff [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1340.46s)]
*  that applies all countries, okay? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1342.5s)]
*  So they didn't get any crazy ones [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1344.5s)]
*  slapped on them. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1346.58s)]
*  Trump was just like 10%. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1347.78s)]
*  So after this conversation, we'll [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1350.06s)]
*  talk about some of the nuances of [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1351.98s)]
*  this in a second, but roughly, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1353.72s)]
*  here's what they get. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1355.46s)]
*  The UK gets, we eliminate a 25% [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1356.94s)]
*  tariff on UK steel in aluminum. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1360.6200000000001s)]
*  It reduces the tariff on British [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1364.66s)]
*  cars from 25%, it was like de facto [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1367.32s)]
*  27.5 because of a service fee, and [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1369.6s)]
*  takes that down to 10% on first [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1372.08s)]
*  100,000 cars, okay? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1374.1999999999998s)]
*  What we get is we are fast tracking [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1375.8s)]
*  US goods through customs. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1378.8s)]
*  The UK is going to buy $10 billion [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1381.24s)]
*  worth of Boeing jets, and [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1384.1999999999998s)]
*  they promise to pull quote, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1386.4399999999998s)]
*  non-tariff barriers to goods. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1388.9199999999998s)]
*  And finally, according to [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1392.76s)]
*  the White House, the deal will, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1393.9599999999998s)]
*  $5 billion opportunity for [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1395.54s)]
*  new exports for farmers, ranchers, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1397.34s)]
*  and producers, including more than [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1399.66s)]
*  $700 million in ethanol exports, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1402.1s)]
*  and $250 million in American beef [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1404.42s)]
*  and other agricultural products. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1406.62s)]
*  There's still some details, but [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1409.7s)]
*  with that, just at that point, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1410.94s)]
*  we'll pause Cenk, what do you think? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1412.1s)]
*  So the beef, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1413.74s)]
*  the agricultural products is real. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1414.3799999999999s)]
*  Getting rid of some of the barriers [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1416.42s)]
*  that existed is real enough. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1418.74s)]
*  The $10 billion Boeing deal they [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1421.7s)]
*  were going to do anyway, right? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1423.1399999999999s)]
*  The fast tracking is pretty easy. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1424.84s)]
*  So here's how you can tell whether [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1427.76s)]
*  it's a big deal or not. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1429.52s)]
*  You go and look at how business [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1430.8799999999999s)]
*  folks are responding. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1432.72s)]
*  And so there, we had two curious [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1434.72s)]
*  things happen. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1436.3999999999999s)]
*  One was the markets responded [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1437.32s)]
*  really positively in the beginning. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1439.08s)]
*  They lost a little bit at the end, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  lost some of their gains at the end, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1442.56s)]
*  so still up a decent amount. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1444.36s)]
*  So they were really encouraged by [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1446.36s)]
*  this. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1447.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, let's see if I'm right or [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1449.0s)]
*  wrong, but I think they're wrong, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1450.1599999999999s)]
*  okay? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1451.3999999999999s)]
*  I think that they were so thirsty [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1452.24s)]
*  for good news that they were like, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1453.94s)]
*  we got a trade deal, kind of, kind [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1456.14s)]
*  of, we have a concepts of a trade [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1458.02s)]
*  deal, right? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1459.8600000000001s)]
*  And they got irrational exuberance, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1461.1000000000001s)]
*  but maybe I'm wrong. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1462.94s)]
*  So JP Morgan put out an analysis and [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1463.94s)]
*  they're like, it'll make just [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1466.46s)]
*  a tiny difference in the UK, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1468.78s)]
*  not sure it'll make any difference [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1470.98s)]
*  in the US. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1473.5s)]
*  So that's their guidance, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1475.0600000000002s)]
*  not to political world, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1476.74s)]
*  they don't care about us. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1478.18s)]
*  That's for the investment folks. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1480.02s)]
*  So if you're making decisions based [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1482.8s)]
*  on this deal, the effect is going [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1485.0s)]
*  to be microscopic. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1487.04s)]
*  So that sounds right to me based on [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1489.28s)]
*  what I know, and [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1491.2s)]
*  their analysis of it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1492.12s)]
*  So I think people are excited for [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1493.76s)]
*  no reason at all, only because [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1495.96s)]
*  Trump punched himself in the face [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1498.0s)]
*  so hard. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1500.28s)]
*  And they think they stopped [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1501.6399999999999s)]
*  bleeding in one of the noses, but [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1503.48s)]
*  I don't think they did. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1505.6s)]
*  And so I'll get to what I think is [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1507.24s)]
*  going to happen next in a second. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  Gotcha, okay, so [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1510.1399999999999s)]
*  then we'll go on with some more [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1511.06s)]
*  details on it. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1512.58s)]
*  It seems that every day since [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1514.58s)]
*  Trump's second term began, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1515.8799999999999s)]
*  at least one cabinet member has [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1517.06s)]
*  utterly debased themselves in front [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1518.54s)]
*  of the cameras. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1520.3799999999999s)]
*  And in an attempt to essentially [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1521.4599999999998s)]
*  spin the effectiveness of Donald [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1523.3799999999999s)]
*  Trump and tout how awesome he was [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1525.4199999999998s)]
*  and basically say, please, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1527.3799999999999s)]
*  please don't fire me. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1529.02s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1530.78s)]
*  said this on purpose in front [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1532.8999999999999s)]
*  of everyone. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1534.6599999999999s)]
*  This was the president's deal and [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1537.1s)]
*  that's not the way it works. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1539.7199999999998s)]
*  If you got to sit next to him, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1540.8799999999999s)]
*  I have the best deal maker to my [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1542.52s)]
*  left. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1544.36s)]
*  And if you don't think that we take [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1545.28s)]
*  advantage of him calling the prime [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1547.1599999999999s)]
*  minister and getting that deal [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1549.12s)]
*  done, you don't understand who's [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1550.8s)]
*  the President of the United States. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1552.76s)]
*  So he's the closer, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1554.4399999999998s)]
*  he gets deals done that we could [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1555.6799999999998s)]
*  never get done because he [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1557.6399999999999s)]
*  understands business, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1559.24s)]
*  he understands deals. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1560.84s)]
*  And that's why we're here today. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1562.56s)]
*  And this is a perfect example of [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1564.08s)]
*  why Donald Trump produced [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1566.1999999999998s)]
*  Liberation Day. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1567.98s)]
*  People don't understand he gets [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1569.3s)]
*  things done in a matter of time. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1571.58s)]

*  And MAGA, if you're not going blah [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1834.48s)]
*  over Lutnick and Bondi and etc, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1836.3200000000002s)]
*  doing the same, I mean, MAGA is [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1838.2s)]
*  supposed to be tough guys. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1840.24s)]
*  You really want to be known as [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1842.92s)]
*  ass kissers? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1844.52s)]
*  I mean, up to you guys. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1845.76s)]
*  So on the trade policy itself, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1847.24s)]
*  here's what's frustrating for me. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1848.68s)]
*  Is like, he went out there and [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1850.0800000000002s)]
*  was like, I am going to, they want [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1851.96s)]
*  to spin it as Donald Trump shook up [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1854.26s)]
*  the world and was like, all right, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1856.54s)]
*  come and play. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1858.94s)]
*  But the first person he's making a [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1861.14s)]
*  deal with, he didn't do that too. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1862.42s)]
*  He just put a 10% tariff on it. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1864.22s)]
*  He didn't do those like crazy [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1865.94s)]
*  reciprocal tariffs on that. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1867.08s)]
*  So that isn't part of the plan. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1868.22s)]
*  This is, and then also Navarro said [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1870.14s)]
*  on day 90, we'll have, as one of [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1872.66s)]
*  them said, they have 200 trade [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1874.98s)]
*  deals, there's not 200 countries. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1877.14s)]
*  This is the stuff I have so [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1879.6200000000001s)]
*  much trouble with. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1880.98s)]
*  The left gets made fun of for [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1882.0s)]
*  pretending everybody, for [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1884.04s)]
*  treating everybody like they're [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1886.04s)]
*  stupid, but I can't call out that [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1888.3600000000001s)]
*  this guy's a weirdo for saying that [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1890.48s)]
*  there's 200 countries and that [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1892.6s)]
*  everybody is going to go with him [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1894.48s)]
*  on that, I find that insane. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1896.3600000000001s)]
*  This was obviously not the plan and [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1898.1200000000001s)]
*  this stuff, most of the deals that [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1900.08s)]
*  Cenk points out were going to [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1902.16s)]
*  happen anyway. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1903.78s)]
*  I don't know about any ongoing [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1904.76s)]
*  trade deals that have specific [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1906.72s)]
*  quotas for deals that were already [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1908.84s)]
*  products for specific planes you [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1911.26s)]
*  were going to buy. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1913.42s)]
*  Yeah, look real quick on that [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1915.14s)]
*  stuff. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1916.94s)]
*  So number one, let's notice that, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1917.54s)]
*  great, Boeing got a deal. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1920.14s)]
*  Who's Boeing? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1921.98s)]
*  Is Boeing living in Kansas, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1924.14s)]
*  Nebraska? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1925.42s)]
*  Where does Boeing live? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1925.94s)]
*  It's a corporation. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1926.86s)]
*  Another corporation got another $10 [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1928.42s)]
*  billion deal. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1930.18s)]
*  Maybe that creates a couple of jobs [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1931.14s)]
*  here in America, but [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1932.94s)]
*  don't get it twisted like they're [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1933.98s)]
*  doing you a favor. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1935.58s)]
*  They're doing a giant corporation [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1936.82s)]
*  who's a donor and [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1938.78s)]
*  a military contractor a deal and [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1939.68s)]
*  a favor, right? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1941.88s)]
*  What I think people want from [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1943.28s)]
*  Boeing is that if the, well, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1945.0400000000002s)]
*  I think most people want the [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1946.72s)]
*  government to do with Boeing is go [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1948.0800000000002s)]
*  in there and push back against some [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1949.92s)]
*  of the weird like, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1951.72s)]
*  the weird like, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1952.76s)]
*  shareholder serving nonsense that [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1953.68s)]
*  they've been doing where they've [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1955.72s)]
*  been cutting, going through and [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1957.52s)]
*  not actually adhering to safety [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1959.3600000000001s)]
*  standards. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1961.16s)]
*  Like that's what we want out of [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1962.0s)]
*  Boeing. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1963.2s)]
*  We don't need like fix the planes [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1963.72s)]
*  first then sell them to Europe. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1965.16s)]
*  Yeah, so 6P44 had an interesting [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1966.78s)]
*  comment on Twitch and [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1969.5s)]
*  one of our members on Twitch. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1971.06s)]
*  The United States imports a wide [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1973.82s)]
*  variety of goods from the UK. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1975.82s)]
*  A significant portion of the UK [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1978.02s)]
*  made cars including, yeah, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1980.06s)]
*  premium brands like Bentley and [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1982.02s)]
*  McLaren are exported to the US. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1984.02s)]
*  And I was like, that's why Britain [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1986.14s)]
*  was up first, not because there's [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1988.1s)]
*  amazing ally, etc. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1989.98s)]
*  But because probably some rich [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1991.02s)]
*  people called and they're like, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1992.78s)]
*  do you know how much the price of [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1995.48s)]
*  Bentley's went up? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1996.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1997.72s)]
*  No, I need to deal with [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1998.22s)]
*  the British immediately. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=1999.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay, so anyway, good point. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2002.1599999999999s)]
*  I love our members. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2004.2s)]
*  By the way, the guy who said that [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2005.96s)]
*  they have already started a 200 [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2007.8s)]
*  trade deals was Donald Trump [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2009.6599999999999s)]
*  himself. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2011.36s)]
*  Donald Trump himself. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2012.12s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2012.84s)]
*  I mean, and nobody can correct [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2014.8s)]
*  the President, hey, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2016.0s)]
*  there aren't that many countries, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2016.8799999999999s)]
*  let alone the ones that you put [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2018.36s)]
*  tariffs on. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2019.52s)]
*  Let alone the fact that we only have [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2020.52s)]
*  one kind of a deal with one country [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2022.56s)]
*  and China's never called and [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2024.5800000000002s)]
*  you kept saying that, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2026.3400000000001s)]
*  they're calling to try to make a [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2027.68s)]
*  deal and then your Treasury [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2029.5800000000002s)]
*  Secretary came out and said, no, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2031.22s)]
*  they're not. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2033.1000000000001s)]
*  We've had no contact with them at [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2034.02s)]
*  all, right? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2035.66s)]
*  Like when do people get tired of [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2036.54s)]
*  the lies? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2038.14s)]
*  And I think that a lot of people [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2039.38s)]
*  are actually, there's folks like [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2040.8600000000001s)]
*  Eric Erickson and [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2042.5800000000002s)]
*  other right wingers who are like, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2043.5s)]
*  this deal sucks. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2045.3400000000001s)]
*  And so, as I've been saying, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2047.42s)]
*  they're splintering like crazy. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2049.54s)]
*  And remember, this one they [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2052.46s)]
*  splinter even more on because big [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2053.84s)]
*  business is on the opposite side. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2055.52s)]
*  So whoever's getting paid by big [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2057.84s)]
*  business is attacking this. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2059.44s)]
*  And Trump can't stop that because [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2061.1600000000003s)]
*  there's too many of them, right? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2062.48s)]
*  And if you're a steel worker, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2064.0800000000004s)]
*  you're like, that's awesome that [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2065.56s)]
*  Trump just helped British steel [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2067.4s)]
*  workers by eliminating that terror. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2069.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you make a fair [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2072.0s)]
*  trade deal, no problem. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2073.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, their side is going to win [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2074.88s)]
*  while we win as well. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2076.48s)]
*  Whether it's a good trade deal is [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2077.96s)]
*  a different question. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2079.4s)]
*  As Erickson points out, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2080.1600000000003s)]
*  again, a right winger, he's like, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2081.36s)]
*  but Britain basically has 2%, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2083.18s)]
*  we kept 10% on them. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2085.58s)]
*  So that's a 5X, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2088.54s)]
*  it's not reciprocal at all. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2089.54s)]
*  It's still kind of gigantic, and [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2091.3799999999997s)]
*  it's still going to raise prices [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2093.3399999999997s)]
*  here in America, not in Britain, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2094.92s)]
*  right? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2096.74s)]
*  And so they're just seeing this all [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2097.7799999999997s)]
*  wrong. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2099.3799999999997s)]
*  So last thing's here for me is, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2099.8799999999997s)]
*  what's next? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2102.02s)]
*  So what's next is in the Port of [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2104.14s)]
*  Seattle, they did a story on cable [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2106.2999999999997s)]
*  news outlets yesterday. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2108.8599999999997s)]
*  There was a grand total of zero [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2111.08s)]
*  ships that had come in yesterday. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2112.92s)]
*  And the last time that happened was [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2115.7999999999997s)]
*  during the great supply chain [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2117.3599999999997s)]
*  problems of the pandemic. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2118.64s)]
*  The ships are not coming in because [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2120.44s)]
*  there's nothing to sell because [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2121.8199999999997s)]
*  they normally get from Asia, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2123.2s)]
*  not just China, he explained, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2124.68s)]
*  the guy who runs the port, but [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2126.04s)]
*  a lot of Asia. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2127.68s)]
*  But the ones from China has [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2129.12s)]
*  145% tariffs, so [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2130.7999999999997s)]
*  you can't sell them, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2131.96s)]
*  it's way too expensive. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2133.3599999999997s)]
*  So they're not bothering to ship [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2135.0s)]
*  it, because no one's going to buy [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2136.3199999999997s)]
*  it with that kind of tariff. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2137.88s)]
*  So tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2140.14s)]
*  tick, tick, tick, tick. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2142.1s)]
*  So what I always tell you is hold [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2143.98s)]
*  us accountable. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2145.2200000000003s)]
*  If it turns out there are no empty [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2145.98s)]
*  shelves, the prices don't go up. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2147.42s)]
*  I was being alarmist because I have [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2149.14s)]
*  TDS, right? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2151.1800000000003s)]
*  Then okay, say, hey, Cenk, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2152.58s)]
*  you were wrong, look at this. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2153.6600000000003s)]
*  Here we are in June, July, August, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2154.78s)]
*  and nothing happened, and we got [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2156.82s)]
*  nothing but great deals from Trump. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2158.6600000000003s)]
*  All right, then we'll see if that [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2160.9s)]
*  happened, okay? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2162.26s)]
*  Well, my guess is, once they start [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2163.14s)]
*  seeing empty shelves in the higher [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2165.1s)]
*  prices, a larger number of people [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2166.94s)]

*  And then that's when Trump is going [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2172.64s)]
*  to start backpedaling furiously. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2174.56s)]

*  the drug companies, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2586.7400000000002s)]
*  that would be great. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2587.54s)]
*  Now, is she going to do that? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2588.3s)]
*  I would be shocked. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2590.66s)]
*  I would fall over and, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2591.72s)]
*  they always promise these things. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2593.08s)]
*  Do they actually, so far have they [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2597.8399999999997s)]
*  delivered on any of them? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2599.48s)]
*  No, we had one rule from the Health [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2601.0s)]

*  don't criticize Israel, otherwise [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2603.8799999999997s)]
*  it'll be bad for your health, right? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2605.3599999999997s)]
*  What does that have to do with [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2606.72s)]
*  anything, okay? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2610.04s)]
*  So if they focus like a lazy remond [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2611.52s)]
*  these, great, but [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2614.72s)]
*  they're not going to, and [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2616.2799999999997s)]

*  measles. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2620.5s)]
*  Man, I don't know why they don't [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2622.18s)]
*  want to be popular. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2623.7400000000002s)]
*  Like a huge portion of maha and [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2624.7400000000002s)]
*  people that like what they're [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2626.62s)]

*  our food and our medicine and [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2634.62s)]
*  they're charging prices that [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2636.22s)]
*  are way too high. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2637.7400000000002s)]
*  If you actually tackle that, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2638.7s)]
*  you'd be a hero, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2640.22s)]
*  they'd build statues of you. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2641.1s)]
*  But this is not going to do that. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2642.9s)]
*  Now, so, and [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2644.58s)]
*  if I'm wrong about it, great, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2645.18s)]
*  I'm super happy to be wrong about [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2646.7s)]
*  that. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2648.34s)]
*  Okay, now, so [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2649.0s)]
*  why do I think that dietary [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2649.88s)]
*  supplements, come on, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2651.32s)]
*  get the hell out of here, man. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2652.56s)]
*  I know, I know, my thing is going [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2654.36s)]

*  I got it, I got it, okay? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2657.0s)]
*  And I'm going to be smarter if I [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2658.12s)]
*  take your dietary supplements and [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2659.6s)]
*  I'm going to live forever. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2661.28s)]

*  I don't believe it at all, okay? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2663.56s)]
*  So are there limitations to [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2665.76s)]
*  Western medicine? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2667.0s)]
*  Yes, but is Western medicine [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2667.64s)]
*  awesome? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2669.64s)]
*  Yes, it's awesome. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2670.56s)]
*  That doesn't mean we should pay [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2672.6s)]
*  super high drug prices, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2673.84s)]
*  that's corporate power, right? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2674.84s)]
*  But the medicine actually works and [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2676.72s)]
*  your ointment might help around [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2678.62s)]
*  the edges, but [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2680.58s)]
*  it ain't going to be cancer, okay? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2681.46s)]
*  So and then one more thing for [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2683.54s)]
*  now is that, look, so [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2685.74s)]
*  now the Loomer part, right? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2687.42s)]
*  I don't understand why she has this [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2689.74s)]
*  unbelievable outsized influence and [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2692.74s)]
*  power. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2695.98s)]
*  Like she previously was such [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2696.86s)]
*  a rando fringe character, right? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2699.46s)]
*  I mean, in the soap, like Dan [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2702.8199999999997s)]
*  Bongino was, it's just a big [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2704.94s)]
*  random person, was way bigger than [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2707.0s)]
*  Laura Loomer. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2709.32s)]
*  Now he's like deputy under deputy [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2710.12s)]
*  of the under something or other, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2712.2s)]
*  right? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2714.12s)]
*  Whereas Laura Loomer is like, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2714.64s)]
*  you're fired, you're fired. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2716.16s)]
*  She's like the new apprentice, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2717.52s)]
*  right? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2719.4s)]
*  And so she's like, you're hired, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2720.0s)]
*  you're fired, and everybody's [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2721.68s)]
*  listening to her and [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2723.2400000000002s)]
*  Trump's listening to her. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2724.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2725.8s)]
*  I don't get it, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2727.36s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2728.16s)]
*  It would be like, just again, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2729.64s)]
*  you pick like a super rando lefty [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2731.76s)]
*  online who blogs from time to time [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2733.84s)]
*  and then they get to make decisions [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2735.98s)]
*  for Joe Biden when he's in office. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2738.18s)]
*  Unimaginable, right? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2740.58s)]
*  The Democrats don't listen to [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2742.3s)]
*  their base enough. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2743.5s)]
*  If this is just like there's no [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2744.66s)]
*  other shenanigans going on, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2745.9s)]
*  this might be listening to your [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2747.18s)]
*  base a little bit too much. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2748.42s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if it's like on [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2750.3s)]
*  purpose or just by happenstance [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2751.7400000000002s)]
*  because Trump is such a like, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2753.34s)]
*  who am I talking to right now? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2754.7s)]
*  And that's who I'm going to cater [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2756.02s)]
*  the pitch to, individual. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2757.86s)]
*  Like the way the algorithms work is [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2760.3s)]
*  they just kind of send it to [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2762.54s)]
*  a kind of person. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2764.2200000000003s)]
*  They send what you're saying to [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2765.72s)]
*  a kind of person who'd be into [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2767.16s)]
*  that. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2768.56s)]
*  And so that benefits someone like [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2769.56s)]
*  Trump who's always lying and [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2771.62s)]
*  trying to make one kind of person [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2773.2599999999998s)]

*  And that's all they see in their [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2777.3199999999997s)]
*  feeds is that kind of stuff. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2778.7599999999998s)]
*  So Trump is doing the big umbrella [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2779.9199999999996s)]
*  thing by just pulling RFK Jr. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2782.3999999999996s)]

*  people who are into this stuff that [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2785.96s)]

*  all they see all day on their feeds. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2790.68s)]

*  I'm going to say he's in charge. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2794.78s)]

*  And all the RFK stands are now on [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2799.6600000000003s)]
*  my side. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2801.2200000000003s)]
*  I think that's what it is. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2802.42s)]
*  I think the Democrats can probably [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2803.3s)]
*  learn from that because there's [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2805.1000000000004s)]
*  less danger in letting progressives [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2806.6600000000003s)]
*  be in charge of stuff. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2808.82s)]

*  I think that's the problem. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2842.84s)]
*  I will do say one positive upside [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2844.56s)]

*  And certainly in Trump one, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2861.5s)]
*  no one was allowed to dissent. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2863.3s)]

*  we're going to tell you the vice [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2869.6600000000003s)]
*  president, obviously Laura Loomer, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2870.98s)]

*  these are real conflicts that [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2879.26s)]

*  This is not playing around. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2882.12s)]

*  So I'm glad there's dissension. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2884.42s)]
*  So here's Nicole Shanahan who is [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2886.7200000000003s)]
*  RFK Jr's former running mate. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2888.36s)]

*  Yes, it's very strange, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2901.56s)]
*  doesn't make any sense. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2902.44s)]
*  I was promised that if I supported [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2903.32s)]

*  With regards to the siblings, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2929.26s)]

*  Basically, The Manchurian Candidate [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2943.56s)]
*  is a movie book and [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2945.92s)]
*  then two movies about someone [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2946.88s)]
*  getting brainwashed and [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2948.48s)]
*  then put into the highest levels of [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2949.96s)]

*  MAGA, you got to be super pissed [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2960.56s)]

*  Loomer said big guy, none of her. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2981.38s)]

*  Right? That's my guess. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2985.3s)]
*  I know all the people think he's [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2986.58s)]
*  a strategic genius. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2988.02s)]
*  Doesn't know what the Declaration [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=2990.1s)]

*  Yeah. So when's he going to unleash [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3009.84s)]
*  this information and put the child [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3011.72s)]

*  It's not the right time yet, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3017.32s)]
*  is what one literally said to me. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3018.48s)]
*  It's like, so [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3019.68s)]
*  when's the right time going to be? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3020.08s)]
*  Anyways, wasn't he with Epstein [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3021.36s)]
*  multiple times over the years and [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3022.64s)]
*  didn't he just bring a section of [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3023.96s)]
*  sex trafficker back to the states [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3025.34s)]

*  I don't know, you tell me. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3028.3s)]

*  Something that has captivated [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3067.5s)]
*  the attention of people not just [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3069.18s)]
*  here in the United States, but [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3070.7799999999997s)]

*  Attorney General Pam Blondie, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3085.7s)]

*  Now Cenk, as we talked about, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3088.44s)]

*  get these files released? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3095.08s)]
*  No, the Epstein files are one of [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3096.52s)]
*  the most interesting things going [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3098.6s)]
*  on in the US government now. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3100.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3102.8s)]
*  Because of their importance? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3104.48s)]
*  Well, they're very important and [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3105.52s)]
*  I want them released. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3106.92s)]
*  God knows what they're doing with [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3107.92s)]
*  them now. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3109.44s)]
*  But more so because it is showing [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3110.0s)]
*  a lot of MAGA, not a little number [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3112.44s)]
*  of folks that voted for Trump. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3114.84s)]
*  A lot of them are going, I guess [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3117.18s)]
*  everyone was liars. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3119.8599999999997s)]
*  Pam Blondie was a liar, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3121.54s)]
*  Trump was a liar, because they said [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3122.92s)]
*  day one, Cash Patel's a liar. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3124.98s)]
*  They said day one, this is day 108. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3126.98s)]
*  And the only thing they could [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3129.98s)]
*  possibly be doing is scrubbing those [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3131.74s)]
*  files as we speak. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3133.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3134.98s)]
*  Right? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3135.5s)]
*  So but this fight though is [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3136.02s)]
*  important because they're not [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3137.7s)]
*  holding the line. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3139.62s)]
*  In the past, they will always hold [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3140.74s)]
*  the line. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3142.8199999999997s)]
*  Pam Blondie is not a liar, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3143.42s)]
*  but she's not a liar. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3144.98s)]
*  She's not a liar. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3146.28s)]
*  Those lines are obviously true. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3147.2400000000002s)]
*  And they would have flipped [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3149.2400000000002s)]
*  already and they would have been [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3150.0400000000004s)]
*  like Epstein was an upstanding [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3151.0400000000004s)]
*  citizen. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3152.1600000000003s)]
*  Of course Trump shouldn't release [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3152.6600000000003s)]
*  his files. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3154.1200000000003s)]
*  This could hurt people, etc. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3154.84s)]
*  But they're not doing that. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3156.0800000000004s)]
*  They're looking to rip somebody's [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3157.5600000000004s)]
*  face off because these files [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3159.44s)]
*  haven't been released and [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3160.96s)]
*  aren't going to be released. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3162.2400000000002s)]
*  And they're beginning to realize, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3163.8s)]
*  maybe that Trump's also a politician. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3165.8s)]
*  So this lateness is something that [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3168.44s)]
*  Laura Loomer is taking very [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3170.6800000000003s)]
*  personally. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3172.32s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3173.5200000000004s)]
*  And usually you hear all these [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3174.16s)]
*  canned responses from politicians [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3175.98s)]
*  that just go ahead and [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3178.2799999999997s)]
*  defend Pam Blondie, right? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3179.72s)]
*  And they say, Pam Blondie is doing [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3181.94s)]
*  such a great job. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3183.8999999999996s)]
*  It's like all this circle jerk [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3184.94s)]
*  bull, yeah, yeah, she's so amazing. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3186.8399999999997s)]
*  My gosh, she's so great, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3189.94s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3190.8399999999997s)]
*  Right, yeah, she's not so great. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3192.1s)]
*  Trust me, guys. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3193.46s)]
*  She's not really doing such [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3194.22s)]
*  a great job. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3194.94s)]
*  First she said that the files were [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3195.5s)]
*  on her desk, right? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3196.94s)]
*  And then she had that ridiculous [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3197.94s)]
*  binder gate situation at the White [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3199.3399999999997s)]
*  House where she made all these [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3200.8599999999997s)]
*  crazy binders that were not even [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3202.14s)]
*  full of Epstein documents and had [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3203.56s)]
*  these influencers essentially run [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3205.2799999999997s)]
*  a state media campaign for her [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3207.12s)]
*  where they wave these binders [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3208.74s)]
*  around pretending like they were [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3210.48s)]
*  given Epstein files by Pam Blondie. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3212.38s)]
*  Well, it turns out there's really [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3214.72s)]
*  nothing in the binder. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3216.42s)]
*  Then she goes on Fox News and says, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3217.68s)]
*  the files are on my desk right now. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3220.32s)]
*  Then she tells Mark Levin that the [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3223.12s)]
*  files are being delivered to my [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3226.0s)]
*  office in a truck. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3228.72s)]
*  So they were on her desk, but [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3230.4s)]
*  then they weren't on her desk. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3232.46s)]
*  And then they were delivered to her [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3234.86s)]
*  office in a truck. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3236.7400000000002s)]
*  And then the big bad bogeymen over [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3238.06s)]
*  at the Deep State were trying to [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3240.18s)]
*  sabotage her and they lied to her [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3242.06s)]
*  about the real Epstein documents. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3244.02s)]
*  And then they were going to be [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3246.7400000000002s)]
*  released at a later date, but [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3248.42s)]
*  now, right, we don't know. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3250.1s)]
*  So she's not the only one who [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3253.1s)]
*  thinks that, we have more. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3254.86s)]
*  I hope James has the Epstein files [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3258.38s)]
*  because I don't think the Department [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3261.0s)]
*  of Justice has them, or at least [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3263.24s)]
*  the Attorney General does not have [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3265.16s)]
*  them or she would have turned them [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3267.3199999999997s)]
*  over. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3269.24s)]
*  The President ordered them [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3269.7599999999998s)]
*  released, the Attorney General [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3270.96s)]
*  ordered them released. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3272.6s)]
*  We all know they have not been [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3273.96s)]
*  released. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3275.48s)]
*  And one of my biggest fears that I [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3276.2s)]
*  had, and I expressed this with, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3278.2s)]
*  was crash Patel and a lot of people, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3280.08s)]
*  Stephen Miller and a lot of people [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3282.16s)]
*  going into the new administration. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3284.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, I hope they're not [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3286.6s)]
*  shredding documents, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3288.44s)]
*  right now. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3289.86s)]

*  the transition. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3292.1400000000003s)]

*  documents, but you all need to go [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3295.1800000000003s)]
*  on that first day and try to get [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3297.1000000000004s)]
*  all this stuff released because my [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3298.84s)]
*  fear is from what I've dealt with [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3300.94s)]

*  Let's take a look at this. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3323.0s)]
*  I have full faith in cash Patel and [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3324.3999999999996s)]
*  AG Bondi to deliver those files, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3326.6s)]
*  but I want to be very clear about [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3328.64s)]
*  something the American people want [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3330.68s)]

*  And although we are same team, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3335.2s)]
*  I'm going to continue to press for [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3336.7999999999997s)]
*  that transparency because that is [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3338.52s)]
*  exactly what the American people [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3340.2799999999997s)]
*  asked for when they elected [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3341.9599999999996s)]

*  ten pages names redacted of victims [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3348.14s)]
*  and information explaining what [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3350.18s)]
*  Epstein was doing confirming some [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3352.18s)]

*  I told the crew over the weekend I [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3369.94s)]
*  said it's Pam Bondi. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3372.54s)]
*  It's Pam Bondi, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3374.28s)]
*  according to my sources. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3375.48s)]

*  what they've done to children, and [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3385.4s)]

*  The number one accuser of Epstein, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3388.0s)]

*  I don't know what to make of it, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3398.4s)]
*  Cenk, they all seem pretty upset. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3399.5200000000004s)]
*  And their job is to tell Trump that [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3401.2000000000003s)]
*  he's right about everything. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3402.6000000000004s)]

*  Yeah, look, again, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3404.82s)]
*  two parts of this story. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3406.0600000000004s)]
*  The fact that they're all pissed is [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3407.6600000000003s)]
*  great news. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3409.6200000000003s)]
*  It's great news on a couple fronts, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3411.02s)]
*  one, they should be pissed. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3412.6200000000003s)]
*  There was a giant lie about [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3414.0600000000004s)]
*  the FC files. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3415.5600000000004s)]
*  I think the FC files are actually [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3416.94s)]
*  really important. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3418.7000000000003s)]
*  And so did Epstein use blackmail on [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3419.86s)]
*  politicians? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3422.7400000000002s)]
*  It's a super important question, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3424.82s)]
*  right? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3426.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, I'm not sure that it gets [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3427.5800000000004s)]
*  more important than that. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3428.9s)]
*  So the fact that they're not [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3430.1000000000004s)]
*  letting it go is great news. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3431.5s)]
*  But equally important is, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3433.12s)]
*  this is not the cult you knew back [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3434.7999999999997s)]
*  in 2016. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3436.8399999999997s)]
*  I know when I said that, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3437.4s)]
*  everybody got super mad, no way. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3438.64s)]
*  You're doing something. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3440.64s)]
*  No, guys, here they are. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3442.48s)]
*  I mean, do we have to show you? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3443.92s)]
*  5, 10, 15, 20? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3445.52s)]
*  So they're not all turned on Trump, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3447.64s)]
*  but they're not saying that we [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3449.6s)]
*  regret or crying, we wish we'd [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3451.4s)]
*  voted for Kamala Harris. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3453.12s)]
*  Of course, that's not going to [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3454.92s)]
*  happen, right? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3455.88s)]
*  They're mega, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3456.56s)]
*  they're conservatives, right? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3457.16s)]
*  But they begin to realize that [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3458.6s)]
*  maybe, just maybe, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3460.12s)]
*  that Trump and the people in [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3461.04s)]
*  the Trump administration might be [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3462.5s)]
*  full of crap. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3464.14s)]
*  That is an awesome development, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3464.86s)]
*  a wonderful development. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3466.7400000000002s)]
*  So I mean, in the past, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3468.5s)]
*  they would have never called out [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3469.54s)]
*  somebody like Pam Bondi, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3470.98s)]
*  the attorney general, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3472.1s)]
*  when Trump is still 100% on her [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3473.42s)]
*  side calling her Pam Blondie, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3475.34s)]
*  the liar. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3477.22s)]
*  And I love that they're waking up [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3478.9s)]
*  to the fact that, it turns out [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3480.34s)]
*  politicians might be liars. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3481.7400000000002s)]
*  Of course, of course, but [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3483.9s)]
*  in the past, they would have said, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3485.54s)]
*  yeah, that's true of the Uniparty, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3487.5s)]
*  and they might even set it up [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3489.42s)]
*  Mitch McConnell, etc., right? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3490.82s)]
*  Of the establishment of [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3492.82s)]
*  Republicans, but they would have [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3493.62s)]
*  never said it about Trump. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3494.52s)]
*  They would have never said it about [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3495.78s)]
*  MAGA people, and now they're saying [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3497.02s)]
*  it left and right and center. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3498.42s)]
*  They're saying it everywhere. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3499.94s)]
*  I got more on that, but [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3501.78s)]
*  you want to jump in on that? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3502.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3503.7s)]
*  I don't know if they're a different [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3504.9s)]

*  their kidneys or [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3516.78s)]
*  wherever adrenochrome comes from. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3517.46s)]
*  It's just they've had enough time [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3519.1s)]
*  to entertain the notion that [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3520.78s)]
*  maybe Trump's a politician. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3522.2s)]
*  And he was able to be like, hey, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3523.96s)]
*  I'm the alternative to the insider [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3525.7599999999998s)]

*  president before. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3529.3799999999997s)]
*  And now he's been president for [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3530.9199999999996s)]
*  a grand total of four years and [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3532.5s)]
*  100 days. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3533.94s)]

*  But some of them are going to take [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3547.16s)]
*  those. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3548.3599999999997s)]
*  But what's crazy to me is that they [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3548.8799999999997s)]
*  always thought Trump was [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3550.6s)]
*  the solution to this stuff, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3551.86s)]
*  even though there's tons of photos [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3553.26s)]
*  of Trump with these people. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3555.2000000000003s)]
*  And the answer electorally is to [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3556.82s)]
*  get them to get so [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3558.98s)]
*  disenchanted by Donald Trump, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3560.02s)]
*  they go back to not voting at all. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3562.1200000000003s)]
*  Or switch sides, I just, one thing [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3564.1000000000004s)]
*  is easier than the other. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3566.7400000000002s)]
*  I think those are the two [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3568.78s)]
*  possibilities. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3569.94s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you, Brett. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3570.6600000000003s)]
*  But look, think about the entire [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3571.7000000000003s)]
*  spectrum. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3573.58s)]
*  So you're talking about hardcore [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3574.1000000000004s)]
*  QAnon guys, right? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3576.1400000000003s)]
*  And that is a shockingly high 15% [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3577.34s)]
*  of the country, right? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3579.34s)]
*  15% of the country, it makes me [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3580.8s)]
*  despair of humanity that it's 15% [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3582.44s)]
*  of the country, right? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3584.44s)]
*  So that's a big, big number. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3586.0400000000004s)]
*  So I forget if it's 15% of the [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3588.2000000000003s)]
*  country or the republicans, but [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3589.44s)]
*  either way it's a giant number, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3590.84s)]
*  right? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3592.2000000000003s)]
*  But Trump got 51% of the vote, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3592.7200000000003s)]
*  right, a little bit over 51%. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3596.1200000000003s)]
*  So there's an enormous part of that [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3600.1200000000003s)]
*  political spectrum that voted for [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3601.84s)]
*  Trump that isn't QAnon, right? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3603.52s)]
*  And that thought, well, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3605.28s)]
*  I mean, he's anti-establishment. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3606.44s)]
*  And I know the establishment guys [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3608.52s)]
*  are going to go to crap, right? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3609.9s)]
*  So he seems like he's authentic [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3611.02s)]
*  because he says crazy stuff, right? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3612.46s)]
*  And that seems all the, and [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3614.42s)]
*  I hate inflation and immigration, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3615.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm voting for that. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3617.26s)]
*  Those guys, we can definitely win [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3618.2200000000003s)]
*  back. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3619.86s)]
*  And the fact that there's some of [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3620.38s)]
*  them are also waking up and going, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3622.1800000000003s)]
*  yeah, not what I bargained for, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3624.2200000000003s)]
*  right? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3626.02s)]
*  And I didn't know he was, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3626.52s)]
*  they didn't know. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3627.82s)]
*  And for us, it seems crazy. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3628.7400000000002s)]
*  How could you not know that [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3630.06s)]
*  Donald Trump's a liar, right, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3630.98s)]
*  in a con man? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3632.1800000000003s)]
*  But they didn't know because they [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3633.2200000000003s)]
*  didn't, that's not the media they [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3634.3s)]
*  got, right? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3635.34s)]
*  But look at now the change, right? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3635.86s)]
*  So even Laura Loomer, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3637.7000000000003s)]
*  genuinely little nutso, right? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3639.48s)]
*  And I'll come back to my [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3641.92s)]
*  disagreements with her in a second. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3642.68s)]
*  And my agreement's interesting, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3644.08s)]
*  but she's like, yeah, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3645.88s)]
*  what's Pam Blonde going to do? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3647.16s)]
*  Blame the boogeyman deep state? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3649.08s)]
*  So now they're saying that [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3652.56s)]
*  the deep state's an excuse. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3654.44s)]
*  I mean, I never thought I'd see, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3656.44s)]
*  even I didn't think that would [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3658.12s)]
*  happen, right? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3659.6s)]
*  The deep state is BS and [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3660.52s)]
*  an excuse for not doing the thing [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3661.92s)]
*  you're supposed to do? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3663.8s)]
*  That's a great development. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3665.16s)]
*  Right, my pitch to them, and [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3666.2599999999998s)]
*  the only reason I say that it's [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3667.9799999999996s)]
*  more like QAnon is because it's [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3669.8999999999996s)]
*  an Epstein thing, right? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3671.7799999999997s)]
*  Like this is an Epstein story, so [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3673.4199999999996s)]
*  that's explicitly what it's about. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3674.9799999999996s)]
*  It's not like, tell me about how [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3676.9799999999996s)]
*  come a shoe factory closed? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3678.4199999999996s)]
*  And they're like, because they need [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3679.9799999999996s)]
*  the rubber for [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3681.3399999999997s)]
*  the adrenochrome extraction. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3682.06s)]
*  That's different. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3683.18s)]
*  But in this scenario, I just think [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3684.06s)]
*  I have an easier time getting [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3686.4599999999996s)]
*  people to come around on points [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3688.2999999999997s)]
*  when I go, you get to believe what [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3690.3799999999997s)]
*  you believed before. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3692.54s)]
*  Because before this, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3694.7200000000003s)]
*  you thought that all billionaires [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3695.7200000000003s)]
*  were corrupt weirdos living in [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3697.1600000000003s)]
*  a cabal and giving each other [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3698.44s)]
*  favors and covering stuff up for [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3699.6400000000003s)]
*  each other. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3701.0400000000004s)]
*  What if I told you, if you dislike [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3701.84s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3703.7200000000003s)]
*  you could go right back to believing [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3705.3s)]
*  everything you believed in [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3706.98s)]
*  the past? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3708.3s)]
*  Because what's more likely, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3708.96s)]
*  that this one billionaire, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3710.5200000000004s)]
*  these two billionaires are [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3712.0400000000004s)]
*  the exception? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3713.5200000000004s)]
*  But meanwhile, the other billionaires [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3714.48s)]
*  flocked to him the minute he said, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3716.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to go after you guys. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3717.6000000000004s)]
*  Or is it more likely that all [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3719.5200000000004s)]
*  the billionaires are acting the [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3721.0400000000004s)]
*  same way you always thought they [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3722.86s)]
*  did and Donald Trump is no [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3724.54s)]
*  exception? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3725.88s)]
*  Yeah, so last things on this for [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3726.9s)]
*  Loomer, look, she hates Muslims and [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3728.78s)]
*  she says she's a proud Islamophobe, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3730.7400000000002s)]
*  etc. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3732.78s)]
*  But do I agree with her on [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3733.58s)]
*  the FC boss? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3734.7400000000002s)]
*  I do. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3735.38s)]
*  See, you could massively, as much [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3736.02s)]
*  disagreement as possible, 100%. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3738.7000000000003s)]
*  I grew up Muslim, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3742.2200000000003s)]
*  my family's Muslim, saying that [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3743.2200000000003s)]
*  you're an Islamophobe and [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3745.06s)]
*  you hate or fear Muslims is [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3746.54s)]
*  terrible, can't get worse, right? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3747.94s)]
*  What am I going to do, agree to, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3750.1400000000003s)]
*  yeah, you all should hate me? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3751.54s)]
*  No, of course, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3752.9s)]
*  I disagree with that 100%. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3753.8s)]

*  And then the funniest defense of [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3766.36s)]
*  Trump, by the way, on social media [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3768.2400000000002s)]
*  was, he's just doing this to [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3770.32s)]
*  protect Democrats. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3772.0800000000004s)]
*  Trump's a well-known [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3773.6000000000004s)]
*  Democrat protector, so [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3775.6400000000003s)]
*  that's probably the right answer. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3777.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, if you're going to come up [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3780.04s)]
*  with a flimsy excuse, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3781.5s)]
*  do better than that. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3782.38s)]
*  And finally, if you thought they [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3783.54s)]
*  were angry about all this, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3784.94s)]
*  Cash Patel just said in hearings [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3786.18s)]
*  today that he's like, no, no, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3787.72s)]
*  Epstein was definitely a suicide. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3789.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3791.58s)]
*  They're not going to like that, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3792.1s)]
*  because it is unlikely to be [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3793.9s)]
*  a suicide. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3795.7400000000002s)]
*  And certainly, MAGA thinks it's [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3797.1s)]
*  very, very unlikely to be a suicide. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3798.94s)]
*  So that is not going to play well, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3801.5s)]
*  and I'm looking forward to that [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3802.98s)]
*  tomorrow. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3804.34s)]
*  All right, that's all the time we [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3804.86s)]

*  Okay, so guys, we're going to take [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3807.9s)]
*  a break here, of course. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3809.62s)]
*  We've got a second hour with [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3810.88s)]

*  not speaking of cash. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3814.04s)]
*  Joe Biden, what are you doing, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3817.1600000000003s)]
*  brother? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3818.6s)]
*  What are you doing, brother? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3819.1600000000003s)]
*  All right, we'll talk about what [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryalM01ae74&t=3821.52s)]
