# Trump GUSHES Over Benjamin Netanyahu
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M)
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=0.0s)]
*  the likes of which I've never seen before. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=4.64s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen, I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=6.94s)]
*  When I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  everything you have on them. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=15.8s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=17.04s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=18.68s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=20.64s)]
*  Basically I have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=24.12s)]
*  know what the **** they're doing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=29.36s)]
*  You understand that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=34.24s)]
*  And while Trump had some pretty harsh feedback for Israel at the start of this week, the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=35.04s)]
*  president is now providing cover for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=40.52s)]
*  in which he's facing serious charges and trials over. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=45.68s)]
*  Now in a lengthy truth social post, Trump said the following, quote, I was shocked to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=49.8s)]
*  hear that the state of Israel, which has just had one of its greatest moments in history. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=53.92s)]
*  I'm gonna do my best not to vomit as I read this statement. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  So just bear with me. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=65.28s)]
*  And is strongly led by Bibi Netanyahu is continuing its ridiculous witch hunt against their great [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=66.88000000000001s)]
*  wartime prime minister. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=72.88s)]
*  Bibi and I just went through hell together, fighting a very tough and brilliant long time [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=75.2s)]
*  enemy of Israel, Iran. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=81.28s)]
*  Bibi could not have been better, sharper or stronger in his love for the incredible Holy [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=83.44s)]
*  Land. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=90.48s)]
*  Despite all of this, I just learned that Bibi has been summoned to court on Monday for the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=91.28s)]
*  continuation of this long running politically motivated case in order to do him great harm. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=96.08s)]
*  Such a witch hunt for a man who has given so much is unthinkable to me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=102.48s)]
*  Now, Netanyahu is facing some very serious charges, a lot of pay to play schemes, quid [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  pro quo, corruption. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=117.6s)]
*  I'm gonna get into the details in just a minute, but I wanted to give you an opportunity to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=119.92s)]
*  comment on what Trump wrote there, Cenk. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=123.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a couple of possibilities. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=126.08s)]
*  One is as you were joking in the beginning, I've seen files. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=129.2s)]
*  Another is, they APAC or the Adelsus have promised [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=133.28s)]
*  a new bucket of several hundred million dollars. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=137.84s)]
*  We've told you many times Trump has gotten $337 million just from the Adelson family [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=142.32s)]
*  to do whatever Israel demands. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=146.88s)]
*  But as you saw in that first clip, he didn't in the case of Iran. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=148.64s)]
*  When they wanted to continue bombing, Trump said no, which is surprising. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  But we're here to deliver the real news to you and not what you wanna hear necessarily. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  And so Trump did the right thing in that case. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=161.04s)]
*  Now he's back to being an Israeli butler and holding Netanyahu's chair for him. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=163.12s)]
*  So it makes you wonder why. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=169.36s)]
*  But there is a third possible reason, which is that he thinks, look, I got Israel to stop. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  That was hard. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=177.04s)]
*  They have enormous power within America. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=178.08s)]
*  And since Netanyahu listened to me there, I'm going to give him a carrot here, carrots and sticks. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=181.44s)]
*  And the carrot is, you should stop his corruption trial. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=187.52s)]
*  It is a terrible conspiracy against my beloved Bibi. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=191.12s)]
*  But we do know that he called Bibi Netanyahu when Netanyahu wanted to drop more bombs on Iran. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=194.32s)]
*  And apparently ripped into him. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  So he's playing carrots and sticks here is another possibility. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=203.92s)]
*  There's one more possibility, Cenk. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=207.92s)]
*  And it's the likelihood that Trump looks at another world leader who's accused of corruption [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=210.56s)]
*  and says, they're before the grace of God go I. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  I think he probably relates to Netanyahu when it comes to issues of corruption. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=220.8s)]
*  100%, Ana, you're right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  That's a fourth possibility. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=226.88s)]
*  Because he's let so many white collar criminals go in America. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  Pardon people on fraud charges, almost always white collar crime. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=232.4s)]
*  A lot of them have paid him off, but a couple I can't even see if they did a campaign contribution [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  or bought some meme coin or whatever junk he has. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  I just think that he has this like, and that's part of why he let [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=245.6s)]
*  Blagojevich go, the former corrupt Democratic governor of Illinois. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=249.52s)]
*  If he knows you personally, he's much more likely to give you a pardon or push for one. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=254.0s)]
*  And if you're corrupt or fraudulent, etc., then he's like, well, yeah, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=259.2s)]
*  then he sees a kindred spirit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=264.72s)]
*  So that is a fourth possibility. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=266.32s)]
*  Yeah, so I wanna get you a few details about the corruption charges themselves. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=267.68s)]
*  And I'm really happy that these charges haven't been dropped. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=273.2s)]
*  Despite the fact that there's an ongoing genocide in Gaza, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=276.0s)]
*  Netanyahu will have to go to court on Monday. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=280.56s)]
*  So I'm again, very happy about that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  So Netanyahu is currently on trial for three corruption cases, not just one. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=284.96s)]
*  That include accusations of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=289.68s)]
*  Case 1000 has to do with the Hollywood billionaire who [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=294.56s)]
*  allegedly bribed him in return for some favors. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=299.28s)]
*  So he is charged with fraud and breach of trust surrounding allegations that he and his wife Sarah [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=302.0s)]
*  received expensive gifts illicitly from Hollywood media mogul Arnon Milken, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  worth some $206,231. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=313.76s)]
*  And that Netanyahu violated conflict of interest laws when he provided Milken with [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=317.04s)]
*  assistance in renewing his long term US residency visa and sought to help him with tax issues. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=321.6s)]
*  Then there's case 2000. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=328.48s)]
*  In that case, the Prime Minister is accused of fraud and breach of trust over his alleged [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=330.96s)]
*  attempt to reach a quid pro quo agreement with the publisher of the Yediyoth. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=335.12s)]
*  I don't know how to pronounce that, but a newspaper basically, Arnon Noni Moses, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=343.04s)]
*  whereby Yediyoth would give the Prime Minister more positive media coverage in exchange for [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=348.0s)]
*  legislation weakening its key rival, the Israel Hion Free Sheet. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=353.84s)]
*  And then finally, the more serious case is case 4000, also known as the Bizek Walla case. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=361.2s)]
*  It's the most serious case the Prime Minister faces in which he is accused of authorizing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=368.64s)]
*  regulatory decisions that financially benefited Bizek telecommunications giant shareholder [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=372.96s)]
*  Saul Elavick by hundreds of millions of shekels. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  In return, Netanyahu allegedly received favorable media coverage from the Walla [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  news site, which of course this guy that engaged in this corruption with him allegedly [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  owns. And the Israeli Prime Minister in an effort to secure positive coverage for himself and his [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=394.88s)]
*  family allegedly pushed beneficial regulations for powerful individuals in the media, the outlet [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  reported. So this trial is one of the most controversial legal proceedings Israel has [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=405.12s)]
*  faced. I think Netanyahu overall is a bad guy aside from his corruption. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  He's a war criminal. He is obsessed with power. He's a complete and utter narcissist who has, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=418.64s)]
*  I believe, destroyed the perception of Israel in the international community because of the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=424.48s)]
*  fact that he has led the country in its genocide against Palestinians. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=430.24s)]
*  But Donald Trump ended his statement by saying that Bibi Netanyahu's trial should be cancelled [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=436.16s)]
*  immediately or a pardon given to a great hero. I can't stomach it. You guys can see it for [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=440.88s)]
*  yourselves, okay? He thinks that all charges should be dropped. But what's also really [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=446.88s)]
*  interesting, Cenk, is that the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog, has stated that a pardon for Bibi is [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=451.68s)]
*  not currently on the table. And others in Israel, including the leader of the opposition party, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=460.0s)]
*  Yair Lapid, says this. With all due respect and gratitude to the President of the United States, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=468.08s)]
*  he's not supposed to intervene in a legal process of an independent state. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=473.36s)]
*  You guys don't like when a foreign leader intervenes in proceedings in your [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=480.88s)]
*  sovereign country in your independent state. Ain't nothing independent about Israel if they're taking [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=486.16s)]
*  our tax dollars, okay? I'm sorry, but they're highly dependent on the United States. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't think that Trump should have any say in Bibi's corruption charges at all. I wanna be [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=496.72s)]
*  clear about that. But what's good for the goose is good for the mother f-ing gander. But go ahead, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  Cenk. Yeah, no, that is hilarious. I can't believe you guys are interfering in our government. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=507.76000000000005s)]
*  AIPAC, make them stop. I mean, the irony of that is hilarious. Okay, now, look, in credit to Israel, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=512.96s)]
*  their corruption laws are actually much tougher than ours and better than ours. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=522.08s)]
*  So the things that they describe about Netanyahu is Tuesday for an American politician, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=528.24s)]
*  like take goodies from donors. Like, wait, how would we survive if we didn't? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=532.88s)]
*  And then rig the rules so that it's in their benefit? Well, that's what we do for Israel. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=540.08s)]
*  So that's illegal in Israel, but we do it for Israel here in America. And for the military [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  industrial complex and the oil companies and all those guys. That's why I have to look up shirt, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  right? Your problems aren't to your left or to your right. Look up, okay? And in this case, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=557.6s)]
*  it's the donors, right? Shoptyt.com, by the way. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  But these are real laws in Israel. It is definitely corruption. Of course, Netanyahu did it. You think [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  he has moral principles that would prevent him from doing corruption? That's hilarious. I mean, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=574.48s)]
*  no one believes that. I don't even think, I mean, maybe some hard right-wing Israelis do, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=580.32s)]
*  but most of Israel doesn't even believe that. But will they actually prosecute him? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't know, right? Because- [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=589.76s)]
*  They're prosecuting him right now, Cenk. He's gonna go to court on Monday. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=592.0s)]
*  So- Yeah, I hear you. But he's gonna go to prison? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=595.36s)]
*  I would be shocked because he's killed so many Palestinians. Because of that, he has popularity. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=599.0400000000001s)]
*  Because of the corruption and other problems, he's unpopular in a lot of ways in Israel. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=605.76s)]
*  But 80% of Israelis think they haven't gone far enough in Gaza. So they like that he, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=610.32s)]
*  the mayhem and the murder that he committed in Gaza. And his main competitor, I mean, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=615.36s)]
*  Yair Lapid might be from another party, but Nifet Ali Bennett is more likely to win [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=620.16s)]
*  if there's an election. And he's also a super hard right-winger who also hates the Palestinians [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  and would never let them go and is thrilled with the oppression and destruction in Gaza. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=631.6800000000001s)]
*  So that's why in some ways he's hated, and in other ways, he's a national hero [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=638.0s)]
*  for how he's massacred and slaughtered the Palestinians. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=645.12s)]
*  So he's gonna go to prison. If he does, I'll be very impressed by the Israeli court system. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ko0A2bnx8M&t=648.16s)]
