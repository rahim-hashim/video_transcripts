TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Will "America First" TURN On Trump After Israel's Strike?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w)
*  As we mentioned earlier, some of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=0.0s)]
*  the America first Republicans are [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=1.72s)]
*  walking on eggshells as they try to [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=3.6s)]
*  call for peace without actually [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=5.44s)]
*  saying anything bad about Trump and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=7.28s)]
*  his administration. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=9.3s)]
*  So Representative Marjorie Taylor [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=10.98s)]
*  Green wrote this, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm praying for peace, she says, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=14.24s)]
*  peace, that is my official [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=16.32s)]
*  position. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=17.84s)]
*  Not very strong from her. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Charlie Kirk wrote on X, in the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=21.36s)]
*  hours and days to come, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=23.12s)]
*  there will be hawks who urge [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=24.52s)]
*  America to increase its involvement [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=26.12s)]
*  in this conflict. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  We should be deeply skeptical of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=29.72s)]
*  these arguments. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Israel believed their existence was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=32.44s)]
*  at stake and they acted [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=34.6s)]
*  accordingly and impressively. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=35.8s)]
*  This is Israel's fight to finish as [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=37.8s)]
*  they see fit, not America's. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=39.96s)]
*  And other conservatives who are [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=42.92s)]
*  speaking out are a little bit more [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  forceful in doing so. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  In his newsletter, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=47.56s)]
*  Tucker Carlson wrote this, he said, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=48.54s)]
*  on Thursday, Iran's president [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=50.56s)]
*  threatened to destroy any country [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=52.16s)]
*  that eliminates his government's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=53.92s)]
*  nuclear facilities. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=55.72s)]
*  Now the world will learn what that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=57.32s)]
*  looks like. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=59.32s)]
*  While the American military may not [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=60.44s)]
*  have physically perpetuated [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=62.68s)]
*  the assault, years of funding and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=64.56s)]
*  sending weapons to Israel, which [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=66.64s)]
*  Donald Trump just bragged about on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=68.72s)]
*  truth social undeniably placed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=70.72s)]
*  the United States at the center of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=72.6s)]
*  last night's event. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=74.6s)]
*  Washington knew these attacks [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=75.72s)]
*  would happen, they aided Israel in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=77.48s)]
*  carrying them out. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=79.68s)]
*  Despite being complicit in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=81.2s)]
*  the act of war, the president hopes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=82.64s)]
*  last night's events will help his [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=84.68s)]
*  ongoing nuclear negotiations with [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=86.64s)]
*  Iran. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=88.72s)]
*  And finally, Sager and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=89.92s)]
*  Jette wrote, Trump has now praised [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=91.62s)]
*  Israel's strike, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=93.96s)]
*  affirmed US material support, and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=95.2s)]
*  Israeli media is reporting his [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=97.24s)]
*  public opposition was a disinformation [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=99.0s)]
*  campaign to mislead Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=101.32s)]
*  So in other words, Trump, not Israel, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=103.12s)]
*  has made a mockery of all of us who [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=105.8s)]
*  wanted to avoid this war. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=107.88s)]
*  So yeah, he posted that in response [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=109.9s)]
*  to one of his own earlier tweets [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=111.8s)]
*  where he had initially said that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=113.48s)]
*  Israel has made a mockery out of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=115.2s)]
*  the United States. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=116.84s)]
*  And he clarified, no, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=117.8s)]
*  it wasn't just Israel, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=118.72s)]
*  it was our own president who did [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  this to us. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=121.08s)]
*  And Representative Thomas Massey, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=121.6s)]
*  he posted this in response to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=124.0s)]
*  someone calling out the Trump [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=125.8s)]
*  administration as Bush 3.0, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  voted unity party, got uniparty. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=129.8s)]
*  Okay, so last one, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=133.88s)]
*  we're going to end with Jack [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=134.88s)]
*  Posobiec and Matt Walsh. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=136.2s)]
*  And they're taking this opportunity [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=137.92s)]
*  to argue that the United States [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=139.72s)]
*  should take a page from Israel's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=141.28s)]
*  playbook. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=142.92s)]
*  Jack Posobiec asked, when are we [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=143.64s)]
*  going after the cartels like this? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  And then Matt Walsh responded, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=148.44s)]
*  very good question. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=150.0s)]
*  The cartels have been poisoning and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  murdering Americans for decades. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=152.68s)]
*  We could kill them all with [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=154.68s)]
*  a well-planned attack. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=156.08s)]
*  Why haven't we? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=157.28s)]
*  Why haven't we? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=158.28s)]
*  So I like their response to all of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=160.24s)]
*  this was just to completely change [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=162.0s)]
*  the subject and talk about [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  something else that is not [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=165.44s)]
*  the possibility of Trump leading [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=167.12s)]
*  this country into potentially what [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=169.28s)]
*  can be a very large scale war after [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=171.68s)]
*  campaigning repeatedly and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=174.55999999999997s)]
*  calling himself the anti-war [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  president, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=178.44s)]
*  That was one of the big things on [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=180.04s)]
*  his campaign, several campaigns, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=181.64s)]
*  that he said, you know what? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm the anti-war president. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to end the wars as soon [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=186.27999999999997s)]
*  as I get into office, which he [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=187.76s)]
*  hasn't been able to do. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=189.2s)]
*  And I'm not going to get us into [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=190.56s)]
*  any new ones. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  And here we are on the brink of what [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=192.92s)]
*  could be a very large scale [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  conflict. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  But what's a right winger to do? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=197.2s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  disappointing, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=201.32s)]
*  She's known for saying the things [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=203.12s)]
*  that others would never dare to say. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=204.88s)]
*  Where is she now? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=206.56s)]
*  She clearly feels some type of way, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=207.6s)]
*  but now she's too scared to speak [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=210.08s)]
*  up when war is on the actual line. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=212.12s)]
*  And now we've heard from Trump and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=214.88s)]
*  Marco Rubio that Trump didn't [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=216.76s)]
*  actually want this attack to go [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=218.4s)]
*  through, but Israel did it anyway. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  By the way, that makes what Lindsey [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=222.12s)]
*  Graham said in the previous segment [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  all the more ridiculous. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=225.56s)]
*  None of this makes the United [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=226.72s)]
*  States or this Trump administration [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=228.12s)]
*  look good or strong or competent. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=230.08s)]
*  And it is weird, in these [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=232.16s)]
*  discussions between the right wing [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=233.84s)]
*  and the right wing, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=236.16s)]
*  These debates that it's having [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=238.0s)]
*  within itself, we on the left are [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=239.8s)]
*  saying, you know what? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=241.68s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of agree with these [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=243.16s)]
*  right wingers over here, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=244.56s)]
*  not those right wingers over there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=245.68s)]
*  But that's not even what it's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=247.42s)]
*  about, and that's something about [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=248.76s)]
*  this particular story that's so [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=250.48s)]
*  interesting, is that people are [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=252.16s)]
*  looking at this from an outside [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=253.92s)]
*  perspective because now things [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  could potentially get very real. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  And they're saying, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't actually want this, right? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=259.84s)]
*  This is not what I voted for. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=261.0s)]
*  This is not the administration [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=262.8s)]
*  that I voted for, the people who [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=264.2s)]
*  did actually vote for Trump. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=265.6s)]
*  So, Michael, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=266.96s)]
*  let's get your thoughts on this. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=267.72s)]
*  What's astonishing is that they're [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=269.72s)]
*  happy with everything else, right? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=271.4s)]
*  Now they come at this like, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=273.28s)]
*  now this is ridiculous. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=275.12s)]
*  This isn't what I asked for. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=276.84s)]
*  Yeah, everybody has a line. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=277.84s)]
*  Right, I guess so, but that bill, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=279.12s)]
*  that big beautiful bill, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=280.72s)]
*  I love everything in that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=281.92s)]
*  I love what's happening in cities [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=283.36s)]
*  across America, but come on. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=284.72s)]
*  You're right, yes, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=286.52s)]
*  everybody's got a line. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=287.44s)]
*  And it also from just sort of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  a thousand feet away political [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  perspective, it's interesting to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  see a fractured Republican party. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=297.0s)]
*  Because generally in contemporary [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=299.88s)]
*  history, you don't see that a lot. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=301.72s)]
*  But you have seen it in the House [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=303.72s)]
*  of Representatives, and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  now you're seeing it sort of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=306.12s)]
*  writ large within the party. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=307.36s)]
*  That there are these serious [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  divides over serious issues, and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=310.6s)]
*  that doesn't happen. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=312.32000000000005s)]
*  They usually march in lockstep with [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  one another. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=315.48s)]
*  And as I guess it was Matthew [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  said, voted unity party got uniparty. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=318.16s)]
*  And the truth is that that is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=320.92s)]
*  unusual and that has worked [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=322.68s)]
*  against Republicans in the House. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=324.52s)]
*  It has held up legislation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=327.12s)]
*  When this bill comes back from [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=329.08s)]
*  the Senate, it's going to hold it [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=330.56s)]
*  up and maybe make it unsuccessful [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=332.24s)]
*  on the first few tries because of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=333.92s)]
*  the fact that they're so divided. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=335.56s)]
*  And then you get to an issue like [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=337.88s)]
*  this, which is a fundamental issue. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=339.36s)]
*  And you have a president who really [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=341.32s)]
*  isn't in tune with either side. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=343.04s)]
*  He says the right things in terms [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=344.56s)]
*  of saying he does the sloganeering [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=346.56s)]
*  very well, but he doesn't do [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  the other part because he doesn't [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  understand it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=352.24s)]
*  He's about the sloganeering and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  the America first, it sounds good. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=354.44s)]
*  And it works on the trail and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=356.08s)]
*  it did work on the trail at least [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  twice. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  So it's a fascinating thing to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=359.44s)]
*  watch within the Republican party. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  As for Matt Walsh and [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=363.12s)]
*  Jack Bosoviak, I don't agree with [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  these guys very often. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  But it is and I understand it's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=367.2s)]
*  diverting from what the issue at [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=369.2s)]
*  hand is. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=371.28s)]
*  But if you're saying like we're [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=372.0s)]
*  going to go into another country [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  and bomb their nuclear facilities [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=375.8s)]
*  and keep our people, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=377.76s)]
*  put our people in danger. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=378.84s)]
*  Well, why not go to a place where [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=380.4s)]
*  they're already in danger and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  blow the cartels away? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=382.96s)]
*  It's an interesting take at [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=384.52s)]
*  the very least. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=385.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't love it, but [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=387.32s)]
*  it is definitely interesting. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  So a couple of things. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=389.56s)]
*  First, let's start out with our [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=390.96s)]
*  poll on when we do the show live, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=392.24s)]
*  which is Monday through Friday 6 to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  8 PM Eastern. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=395.32s)]
*  Make sure you're checking it out [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=396.24s)]
*  every day. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=397.4s)]
*  We ask you guys to get involved. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  So in this case, will the America [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=398.96s)]
*  first crowd turn on Trump if the US [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  gets involved in the war? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=403.0s)]
*  And so 54% so far saying no. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=405.08s)]
*  And remember, we covered it a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=408.8s)]
*  little bit earlier, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=410.35999999999996s)]
*  the Warhawks, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=411.4s)]
*  So they were always in favor of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  war, those are the neocons and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=414.56s)]
*  they're also in the Republican [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  Party. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  So those guys are not going to turn [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=418.08s)]
*  because they've always been in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=419.88s)]
*  favor of war. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=421.4s)]
*  So the question is, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=422.2s)]
*  is MAGA going to turn? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  So now, let's break that down, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=424.52s)]
*  right? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=426.28s)]
*  So first category of Republicans, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=426.91999999999996s)]
*  the neocons, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=428.76s)]
*  they wanted this all along. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=429.44s)]
*  Second category is Marjorie Taylor [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=430.52s)]
*  Green category in my opinion, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=433.48s)]
*  which is the people who are [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=435.68s)]
*  wishy washy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=437.64s)]
*  So she came on this show and said [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=439.24s)]
*  Israel shouldn't get any more money [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=440.64s)]
*  and that we definitely shouldn't [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=442.36s)]
*  attack Iran. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=443.96s)]
*  But then Israel does attack Iran, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=444.56s)]
*  we do help them. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=446.96s)]
*  And now all of a sudden it's, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=448.44s)]
*  I'm praying for peace. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=450.6s)]
*  Okay, thoughts and prayers. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=453.28s)]
*  What happened? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=455.24s)]
*  I thought you were going to be [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=455.74s)]
*  against it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=456.72s)]
*  Are you against it? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=457.28s)]
*  Or you said MAGA would definitely [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=458.6s)]
*  be against it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=460.44s)]
*  So she's on the record on that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=461.44s)]
*  Let's see how she handles this [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=463.96s)]
*  going forward. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=466.16s)]
*  Apparently a little bit afraid to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=467.04s)]
*  take on Daddy Trump. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=469.68s)]
*  Now, the third category are [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=471.44s)]
*  the people who are like, well, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=473.88s)]
*  I'm stuck here. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=476.72s)]
*  And this is the most [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  interesting category. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=481.12s)]
*  Psobiac and Charlie Kirk both [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=482.72s)]
*  referenced their audience and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=485.48s)]
*  MAGA and America First and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=488.32s)]
*  how they felt about it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=490.64s)]
*  So Charlie Kirk was like, well, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=492.52s)]
*  you know me guys, I love Israel and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=494.8s)]
*  I think Israel's such an important [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=497.24s)]
*  ally and wonderful in parts that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=499.56s)]
*  we didn't read you. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=501.68s)]
*  He had a much longer statement. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=502.84s)]
*  He's like, but [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=504.4s)]
*  I hear what my audience is saying. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=505.12s)]
*  See, I told you forget the leaders [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=508.08s)]
*  the actual MAGA voters. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=509.88s)]
*  A lot of them actually believed [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=511.24s)]
*  anti-war stuff and are anti-war. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=513.04s)]
*  And Michael talked to them and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=515.36s)]
*  they said the craziest things for [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=516.84s)]
*  one, two years straight that he [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=518.56s)]
*  did all those interviews. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=520.48s)]
*  But were they actually anti-war? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=522.0s)]
*  Yes, they were anti-war. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=523.8s)]
*  And also unanimously, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=524.96s)]
*  they differed on other things, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=525.84s)]
*  Cenk, but they were you. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=527.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, mine was more than [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=528.4s)]
*  anecdotal. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=530.2s)]
*  Like I spoke to hundreds and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=531.12s)]
*  hundreds of people. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=532.52s)]
*  They all were unanimous about being [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=534.0s)]
*  anti-war. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=535.76s)]
*  Yeah, and when I tweet and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=536.28s)]
*  I got a lot of followers who are [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=537.4s)]
*  independents and Democrats, but [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  also a lot who are MAGA, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=540.08s)]
*  So when I say anti-war, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=541.76s)]
*  they're like, yes. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=543.48s)]
*  When I say Trump shouldn't send in [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  tanks into military and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=546.72s)]
*  Marines into US cities, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=548.04s)]
*  they're like, boo. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=549.48s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  Like they hate that. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=551.08s)]
*  So they're very clear on what they [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=553.64s)]
*  want and don't want. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=555.12s)]
*  They're not shy at all, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=556.0s)]
*  And they didn't want this war. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  That's why Charlie Kirk's like, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm kind of in the middle. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=559.88s)]
*  Don't yell at me either side. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=561.0s)]
*  Pesopiak is kind of funny thing. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=562.76s)]
*  And again, the longer version that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=564.36s)]
*  I watched of his thing, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=566.24s)]
*  he clearly said MAGA is against [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=567.64s)]
*  this, this is bad. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=569.72s)]
*  I'm worried we're going to get [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=571.12s)]
*  sucked into the war. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=572.96s)]
*  But in order to split the baby, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=574.6s)]
*  he's like, but [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=576.12s)]
*  maybe we should do it in Mexico. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=576.88s)]
*  It's like such a terrible idea for [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=579.64s)]
*  Israel to do this to Iran. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=581.76s)]
*  And in the same breath, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=583.32s)]
*  we should do it to Mexico. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=585.0s)]
*  It's crazy, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=587.2s)]
*  Well, also, I know, but when you, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=588.52s)]
*  right, but when you, it's a totally [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=590.48s)]
*  different conversation and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=592.6s)]
*  you're talking about something else. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=594.2s)]
*  But there is something still [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=596.16s)]
*  compelling to me about that as [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=598.08s)]
*  a juxtaposition to what's going on [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=600.08s)]
*  in the world in terms of what it's [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=602.4s)]
*  doing to America versus just out in [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  the ether. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=607.2s)]
*  Yeah, I understand what you're [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=608.0s)]
*  saying, not that it's right, but [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=609.16s)]
*  that the America first thinks at [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=610.44s)]
*  least the cartels affect us. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=611.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=613.36s)]
*  Whereas Iran doesn't affect us at [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=613.88s)]
*  all. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=615.4s)]
*  And so what are we doing over [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=615.9s)]
*  there? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=617.12s)]
*  And then lastly, you have the group [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=617.84s)]
*  that really is against the war and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=619.76s)]
*  that's Tucker Carlson and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=621.48s)]
*  Tom Massie, right? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=622.68s)]
*  So Tucker Carlson said Trump is [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=623.76s)]
*  complicit, that is heavy language, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=625.6s)]
*  right? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=627.72s)]
*  And we shared some of the other [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=628.6s)]
*  things that he said there. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=629.92s)]
*  And I agree with Tucker on that [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=630.84s)]
*  one. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=632.28s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=632.8s)]
*  I don't know if you noticed, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=633.4s)]
*  he kind of called Trump dumb. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=634.64s)]
*  You might have missed it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=636.0s)]
*  So when he has read it to you [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=637.12s)]
*  there, I'm going to read it again. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=638.84s)]
*  This graphic nine, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=641.04s)]
*  despite being complicit in [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=642.24s)]
*  the act of war, the president hopes [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=643.84s)]
*  last night's events will help his [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=646.04s)]
*  ongoing nuclear negotiations with [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=648.16s)]
*  Iran. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=650.24s)]
*  He's being snide there. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=651.32s)]
*  I know a lot of people will miss it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=652.64s)]
*  But Trump, the story is, and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=654.48s)]
*  we talked about this a little bit [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=656.12s)]
*  in the first hour, that Trump told [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=658.12s)]
*  Netanyahu not to attack. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=660.6s)]
*  But then they were in his ear and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=663.64s)]
*  they're like, no. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=665.28s)]
*  If we attack, we might be more [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=667.12s)]
*  likely to get them to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=668.72s)]
*  the negotiating table. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=669.8s)]
*  And apparently Trump believed that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=671.88s)]
*  enough to get some of our troops [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=674.24s)]
*  out on Thursday, etc. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=676.24s)]
*  And leave it basically dealers [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=677.96s)]
*  choice for Israel, right? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=679.96s)]
*  And then Netanyahu was like, yes, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=682.32s)]
*  sucker, right? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=684.32s)]
*  because the minute I attack, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=685.92s)]
*  you're going to have to defend me. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=687.08s)]
*  And then you're right in [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=688.48s)]
*  the middle of the war. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=689.16s)]
*  And that's what Tucker's referring [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=690.28s)]
*  to, maybe it'll bring us back to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=692.32s)]

*  It's subtle, but [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=696.4s)]
*  he's definitely being sarcastic [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=697.28s)]
*  there about how dumb Trump is and [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=699.0s)]
*  how he got played by Netanyahu. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=700.6s)]
*  And also we shouldn't leave this [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=702.24s)]
*  conversation without mentioning [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=703.84s)]
*  Steven Witkoff, who is an Upper East [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=705.68s)]
*  Side real estate executive, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=707.68s)]
*  is the person in the Middle East [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  representing the United States and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  all of these dealings. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=713.3199999999999s)]
*  And when you talk about only the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=714.92s)]
*  best people, which Trump has said [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=716.64s)]
*  over and over again, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=718.6s)]
*  that's not who you want over there [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=719.88s)]
*  right now dealing with this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=721.96s)]
*  These are unserious people and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=723.8s)]
*  these are serious events that [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=725.36s)]
*  are happening. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=726.82s)]
*  Yeah, and lastly, sorry, yes. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=727.5600000000001s)]
*  Lastly for me is, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=730.6800000000001s)]
*  Massey is truly anti-war. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=732.28s)]
*  So I give Massey credit. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=734.36s)]
*  And today, America first crowd [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=736.28s)]
*  lost, they lost today. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=738.92s)]
*  So maybe they come back, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=741.52s)]
*  maybe they convince Trump, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=742.72s)]
*  maybe Trump flip flops. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=744.04s)]
*  And if he does it in the middle of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=745.6s)]
*  a war, it'll be super [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=747.04s)]
*  interesting to see, right? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=748.16s)]
*  But Magas hurt dog, don't ask him [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=750.28s)]
*  if they're all right, because they [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  have a heavy blow from the neocons [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=753.68s)]
*  today, yes. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=755.4s)]
*  Yeah, and like Trump, he has to be [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=756.12s)]
*  the strong man because he would [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=758.12s)]
*  lose whatever is left of his base [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=759.92s)]
*  if he loses that image. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=761.8399999999999s)]
*  So as much as the right is [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=763.9599999999999s)]
*  struggling with their messaging [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=765.28s)]
*  here, Trump is too, right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=767.04s)]
*  He has to be anti-war, but [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=768.56s)]
*  he also has to maintain this facade [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=770.0s)]
*  that he's actually in control of [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=772.0s)]
*  Israel and Netanyahu. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=773.8399999999999s)]
*  But he especially can't be [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=775.92s)]
*  due by Israel after he gave Biden [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=777.5s)]
*  such a hard time about being [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=779.4s)]
*  the submissive one in the US Israel [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=780.92s)]
*  relationship. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=782.96s)]
*  And then on top of that, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=784.24s)]
*  there's also the relationship [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=785.48s)]
*  between Trump and Putin that Trump [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=787.12s)]
*  is worried about rocking and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=788.96s)]
*  he doesn't want to mess with any [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=790.44s)]
*  of that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=792.0s)]
*  But I mean, like Cenk, you ask kind [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  of rhetorically there, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=794.36s)]
*  what are we doing over there? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  But I do wonder if people really [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=797.2800000000001s)]
*  understand what's going on between [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=799.24s)]
*  both Israel and Iran and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=801.6s)]
*  why are we even involved? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=803.2s)]
*  With all of these wars that we see [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=805.36s)]
*  around the world, especially in [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=807.1600000000001s)]
*  the Middle East, there's always [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=808.96s)]
*  a political angle and [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=810.84s)]
*  ideological angle. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=812.1999999999999s)]
*  And typically, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=813.48s)]
*  the ideological angle is what is [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=814.36s)]
*  used to sell the public on it and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=816.12s)]
*  to garner support from the public. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=817.9599999999999s)]
*  But there's always an underlying [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=820.4s)]
*  political or economic angle that is [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=822.4s)]
*  actually driving different countries [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=824.6s)]
*  to get involved in certain [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=826.88s)]
*  conflicts. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=828.4s)]
*  And with the United States, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=829.52s)]
*  we know that we usually don't [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=830.9599999999999s)]
*  really get involved in anything [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=832.4s)]
*  unless there's something in it for [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=833.92s)]
*  us. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=835.48s)]
*  So what is in it for us here as far [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=835.98s)]
*  as the US and Iran goes? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  So these are all things that we [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=840.16s)]
*  should be thinking about. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=841.72s)]
*  These are the conversations we [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=842.56s)]
*  should be having. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=844.08s)]
*  And on the right, especially, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=844.92s)]
*  they seem to have kind of like [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=846.96s)]
*  gotten away from what it is that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=848.76s)]
*  their goals are here. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=850.68s)]
*  They want to be anti-war, but [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=852.8s)]
*  then they still have people within [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=854.08s)]
*  their coalition who are actively [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=855.76s)]
*  pushing for this war with Iran [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=857.36s)]
*  because they have to back up [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=858.72s)]
*  Israel. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=860.08s)]
*  And what's happening in [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=860.96s)]
*  the Middle East right now, and [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=861.84s)]
*  even with Russia, that was something [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=863.1999999999999s)]
*  we're seeing that we haven't really [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=864.76s)]
*  seen in a while, in a few decades, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=866.4s)]
*  I would say, is that there is [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=868.08s)]
*  an actual ideological war that is [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  happening, right? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=871.2s)]
*  There are people who are waging war, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=872.12s)]
*  leaders who are waging war in other [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=874.44s)]
*  nations on ideological basis. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=876.5200000000001s)]
*  And that's interesting because [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=879.2800000000001s)]
*  people really have a hard time [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=881.44s)]
*  picking a side whenever it's rooted [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=883.44s)]
*  in something like religion or [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=885.9200000000001s)]
*  divine right and that type of [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=887.82s)]
*  thing, so very interesting. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmxJ-OL02w&t=889.5600000000001s)]
