TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Trump Donor Calls Out Commerce Secretary's Conflicts Of Interests
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0)
*  Within 160 million Americans, Mr. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary, as you know, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=2.68s)]
*  are invested in the market. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=4.26s)]
*  Many of them have spent their lives [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=6.32s)]
*  saving for their retirement. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=8.24s)]
*  What is your message to Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=9.96s)]
*  who want to retire right now and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=12.24s)]
*  who've just seen their lifetime [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=14.24s)]
*  savings drop significantly? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=16.36s)]
*  A very tough question and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=19.64s)]
*  we're going to get back to what [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=20.8s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Bissette [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=22.12s)]
*  had to say in response to that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=23.72s)]
*  question in just a bit. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=25.12s)]
*  So hold on tight for that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=26.2s)]
*  But first, we absolutely need to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=28.1s)]
*  dive into this fire hot feud [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=30.62s)]
*  between billionaire Trump donor, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  Bill Ackman, and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=36.34s)]
*  who is now being accused by [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=39.02s)]
*  Ackman of not being an honest [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=40.54s)]
*  player. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=42.46s)]
*  So, as Ackman spent his weekend [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=43.46s)]
*  pleading with Trump to essentially [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  do a 90 day pause on his tariffs in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  order to create some space for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  trade negotiations. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=52.78s)]
*  He also jumped into this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=55.540000000000006s)]
*  interesting accusation against [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=57.220000000000006s)]
*  Howard Lutnick who's been making [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  his rounds on cable television in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=60.74s)]
*  defense of Donald Trump's tariffs [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  policy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=64.54s)]
*  He says, I just figured out why [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=65.54s)]
*  Howard Lutnick is indifferent to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  the stock market and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  the economy crashing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=70.68s)]
*  He and Cantor are long bonds. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  He profits when our economy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=74.86s)]
*  implodes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  It's a bad idea to pick a Secretary [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=77.5s)]
*  of Commerce whose firm is levered [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=79.94s)]
*  long fixed income. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=82.30000000000001s)]
*  It's an irreconcilable conflict of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  interest. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  Now Ackman is of course talking [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=89.02s)]
*  about Cantor Fitzgerald, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=90.9s)]
*  which is the financial firm that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=92.48s)]
*  Howard Lutnick led for 35 years [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=94.34s)]
*  prior to joining the Trump [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=96.26s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  And he's basically just accusing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=99.22s)]
*  him of being so [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=102.22s)]
*  heavily invested in bonds that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=103.62s)]
*  the stock market blowing up as [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=106.34s)]
*  a result of Trump's tariff policies [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=108.78s)]
*  is actually a good thing for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  those who are heavily invested in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=113.4s)]
*  bonds. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=115.72s)]
*  But I don't know how much truth [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  there is behind that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  There is a lot of truth behind [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=119.2s)]
*  that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=120.12s)]
*  Is there? Okay, go ahead. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=120.62s)]
*  So look, first of all, I got no [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=121.36s)]
*  love for anybody on either side [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=125.48s)]
*  Lutnick's been running Cantor [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=127.0s)]
*  Fitzgerald, a big Wall Street firm [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=128.84s)]
*  for 35 years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=131.12s)]
*  Bill Ackman's a really despicable [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  billionaire who bullies people on [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=134.24s)]
*  the issue of Israel and on and on, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=136.28s)]
*  right? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  And they both support Trump. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=138.72s)]
*  So, okay, but we don't really much [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  care about the personalities to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=141.56s)]
*  deal with. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=143.12s)]
*  On this show, we actually focus on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  facts on what's right and not right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  So who's right between these two? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=147.04s)]
*  In terms of the tariffs, I mean, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=148.16s)]
*  it physically bothers me to say it, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=150.0s)]
*  but Bill Ackman is right, right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  On the facts of what tariffs do, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=153.56s)]
*  at least these particular tariffs, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=155.28s)]
*  okay? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=157.28s)]
*  And so on the issue of will Howard [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  Lutnick's firm profit from [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  these tariffs, yes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=162.48s)]
*  Are they among the few that will? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  Yes, because long in Wall Street [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=166.76s)]
*  speak means that you're betting in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=168.76s)]
*  that direction. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=171.0s)]
*  Short means you're betting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=172.08s)]
*  against it, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=173.4s)]
*  So if you're long on what [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=174.44000000000003s)]
*  Cantor Fitzgerald's long on bonds, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  when the markets go down, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=178.8s)]
*  bonds go up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=180.8s)]
*  Because people take their money out [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=182.4s)]
*  of the markets, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  which is a little bit riskier, and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=184.24s)]
*  they put it into something safer, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  bonds, so the value of bonds go up. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=186.96s)]
*  So if his firm was heavy into bonds, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  long on bonds, then they're going [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=190.60000000000002s)]
*  to make out like bandits. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=192.24s)]
*  Now, this is a little bit of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=193.8s)]
*  speculation on my part, but [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=195.0s)]
*  I didn't know that until [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=196.44s)]
*  Ackman pointed it out. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  And I did wonder, Lutnick, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=199.24s)]
*  I swear to you, you take it at face [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=201.04s)]
*  for whatever it's worth because I [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=203.04s)]
*  didn't even say it on air before. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=204.88s)]
*  But I was like, a lot of them look [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=206.44s)]

*  Besson looks uncomfortable. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=209.88s)]
*  Tons of their like, they go on air [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  and they're like, the tariffs are [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  really good for the economy because [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=215.27999999999997s)]
*  they know it's not, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  they know they're lying, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=218.11999999999998s)]
*  it's super embarrassing, etc. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  But the one guy who always seems so [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=221.27999999999997s)]
*  happy, and maybe it's for [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=223.16s)]
*  other reasons, but was Lutnick. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=224.64s)]
*  Lutnick's like, every picture is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=226.88s)]
*  like, and you can see it for [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=228.48s)]
*  yourself. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=229.88s)]
*  Every video, every picture is like, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=230.44s)]
*  we're doing the tariffs, it's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=232.52s)]
*  great. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=234.52s)]
*  And I'm like, really, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=235.16s)]
*  you're that excited as the market [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  is crashing, etc.? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  And this would explain why he's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=240.56s)]
*  excited. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  Again, I can't say for sure that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=243.4s)]
*  that's what Scott Lutnick jazzed up, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=245.28s)]
*  but it is true that that is where [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  his financial incentive. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  So, Cenk, you beat me to it because [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=250.56s)]
*  I was going to ask, well, I mean, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=252.36s)]
*  Lutnick's not the only Trump [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  administration official who's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  making his rounds defending what [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=257.24s)]
*  Trump is doing with the tariffs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=258.96s)]
*  What about Scott Besant? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=260.35999999999996s)]
*  But you make an excellent point [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  about how uncomfortable other [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=263.84s)]
*  administration officials appear to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=265.68s)]
*  be as they're defending Trump's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=267.88s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=269.79999999999995s)]
*  So, by the way, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=270.35999999999996s)]
*  prior to joining the Trump [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  administration, there's evidence, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=272.32s)]
*  he's on the record. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=274.32s)]
*  Scott Besant said that tariffs are [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  bad, they cause inflation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=277.84s)]
*  Now it's an entirely different [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=279.76s)]
*  storyline that we're hearing from [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  Besant. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  But what you just said, Cenk, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=283.56s)]
*  reminded me of the interview that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  Besant recently had with Tucker [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=286.88s)]
*  Carlson. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=288.64s)]
*  Now Besant, of course, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=289.24s)]
*  is the Treasury Secretary. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=290.24s)]
*  And just pay close attention to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=291.8s)]
*  this video and how he looks like [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=293.64s)]
*  he's in physical pain as he's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  talking about something that he [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=297.14s)]
*  typically would not want to talk [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=298.82s)]
*  about, let's watch. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  If I were to say, was there any [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=301.76s)]
*  good outcome from COVID? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=303.88s)]
*  It woke the world up to these [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=305.68s)]
*  supply chain problems. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=307.8s)]
*  So, economic security is national [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=309.88s)]
*  security. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=312.28s)]
*  President Trump and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=313.68s)]
*  I have talked about that a lot. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  So this is a national security [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=315.96s)]
*  issue that we're seeing here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  But it's also an economic security [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  issue, and it's to, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=323.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't want to say redistribute, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=325.72s)]
*  but it is to give working Americans [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=329.04s)]
*  real wage gains and enhance their [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=332.24s)]
*  lives. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=335.12s)]
*  I don't want to say redistribute. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=335.92s)]
*  That was so good. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=339.12s)]
*  Let's just distill that moment. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=340.32000000000005s)]
*  Let's go to the last video here, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  B5. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=344.76s)]
*  The last video here, B5. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=345.28s)]
*  It's to, I don't want to say [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=346.84s)]
*  redistribute. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=349.88s)]
*  That's so good. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=353.23999999999995s)]
*  Besson's got a couple problems. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=353.84s)]
*  One, he's a giant Wall Street [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=355.2s)]
*  banker, so he doesn't want to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  redistribute to the average working [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  guy, so he's like, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=360.96s)]
*  it makes him physically ill to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=362.34s)]
*  think of that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=364.4s)]
*  Okay, but in this case, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  the bigger problem is, that's not [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=366.84s)]
*  going to do that anyway. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=368.5s)]
*  If it was going to do that, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=369.55999999999995s)]
*  then I'd be happy, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=370.67999999999995s)]
*  But so he knows that these tariffs [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  aren't going to work in any way, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=373.92s)]
*  shape, or form. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=375.64s)]
*  He's too smart not to know that, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=376.4s)]
*  right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=377.92s)]
*  So look, he's deeply uncomfortable. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=378.44s)]
*  Here, we'll throw this on [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=381.44s)]
*  the record. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=382.92s)]
*  Scott Besson, not long for [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=383.64s)]
*  this administration. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=385.08s)]
*  It's April 7th today. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=386.68s)]
*  Let's see how long he lasts, okay? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=387.64s)]
*  Interesting, okay. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=389.64s)]
*  Yeah, so he's too rational for [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=390.24s)]
*  this, and it's obvious that it's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=392.04s)]
*  making him deeply uncomfortable. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=393.92s)]
*  So we could disagree with him on [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=395.6s)]
*  other policies, but it's obvious [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=397.44s)]
*  that he didn't sign up for this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=399.44s)]
*  And that's the problem with people [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=401.28s)]
*  that go into the Trump [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=402.84s)]
*  administration or that support him, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=403.88s)]
*  like Bill Lackman, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=405.44s)]
*  Or maybe even Elon Musk, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=406.56s)]
*  because we're going to get to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  a little bit later in the show. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  So they never realize how [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=410.4s)]
*  irrational he is. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=411.88s)]
*  So they always assume, yeah, but [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=413.47999999999996s)]
*  he's got to have some strategy [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  behind the scenes. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he won the presidency [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  twice, he's got to be a genius. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=417.79999999999995s)]
*  It's got to be, I mean, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=419.4s)]
*  not a genius strategic in a way [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=420.4s)]
*  that I can't see from the outside. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=421.96s)]
*  They get inside and they're like, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=424.44s)]
*  whoa, it's way worse than [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=426.08s)]
*  from the outside. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=427.12s)]
*  I thought it was going to be [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  better. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  The guy never does any homework and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=429.52s)]
*  has no rational strategy, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=432.16s)]
*  has no idea what he's talking [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=433.72s)]
*  about. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  So professionals like Besant are [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=436.04s)]
*  going to be the first to go. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=437.56s)]
*  Okay, so now one seemingly random [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=438.72s)]
*  thing that gets to two of the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=441.2s)]
*  themes here though, Tucker Carlson [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=443.08s)]
*  today randomly, or it seemed [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  random to me, but I get why he's [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=447.64s)]
*  doing it, said, hey, we better not [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=449.92s)]
*  attack Iran right now. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=452.32s)]
*  We're in this tariff mess, and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  this would be the very worst time [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=455.52s)]
*  to attack them, which made me go, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=457.24s)]
*  wait, does he know something? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=459.12s)]
*  I don't know, did Netanyahu go to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=460.84s)]
*  the White House, not on tariffs [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=462.64s)]
*  mainly, but to get America to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=464.44s)]
*  attack Iran? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=466.11999999999995s)]
*  Because Tucker has way more inside [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=467.4s)]
*  information than we do on this. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=469.11999999999995s)]
*  So whoa, watch out, okay? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  But notice, here's Ackman breaking [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=473.52s)]
*  against Trump for the tariffs. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=475.67999999999995s)]
*  There's Tucker Carlson warning [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=477.84s)]
*  Trump, you better not attack Iran. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=479.55999999999995s)]
*  There is a ton of disagreement here [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  in right-wing circles. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=483.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, I want to get to what I [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=485.84s)]
*  promised, how exactly did [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=487.84s)]
*  that question about retirement get [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=490.0s)]
*  answered? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=492.88s)]
*  So let's get to that video, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=495.16s)]
*  let's look at video three. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  What is your message to Americans [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=498.88s)]
*  who want to retire right now and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=501.2s)]
*  who've just seen their lifetime [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  savings drop significantly? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=505.44s)]
*  I think that's a false narrative, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  Americans who want to retire right [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  now, the Americans who have put [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=511.72s)]
*  away for years in their savings [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  account, I think they don't look at [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=515.36s)]
*  the day to day for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=517.6s)]
*  fluctuations of what's happening. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=518.52s)]
*  And in fact, most Americans don't [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=521.84s)]
*  have everything in the market. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=523.76s)]
*  Most Americans in a 401k have [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=525.36s)]
*  what's called a 60-40 account. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=527.48s)]
*  That 60-40 accounts are down 5% or [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=530.16s)]
*  6% on the year, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=533.48s)]
*  people have a long term view. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=535.16s)]
*  They have a program that the reason [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=538.2s)]
*  the stock market is considered [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=540.4s)]
*  a good investment is because it's [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=542.36s)]
*  a long term investment. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=544.36s)]
*  If you look day to day, week to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=545.76s)]
*  week, it's very risky. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=547.64s)]
*  Over the long term, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=549.52s)]
*  it's a good investment. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=550.52s)]
*  I'm going to leave Cenk to directly [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=552.24s)]
*  respond to what Bessent said in [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=554.48s)]
*  that video, but I'm going to use [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=556.64s)]
*  this as an opportunity to say, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=558.72s)]
*  this is why social security is lit. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=560.72s)]
*  Because it is not tied to the risk [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=563.4s)]
*  of the stock market, okay? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=566.2s)]
*  It is money that you can look [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=569.0s)]
*  forward to getting in your [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=571.08s)]
*  retirement years, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=573.1600000000001s)]
*  you've paid into the system. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's just a fixed amount that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=576.92s)]
*  you are entitled to, and it has [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  nothing to do with the stock [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=580.28s)]
*  market. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=581.68s)]
*  We must protect social security at [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=582.4399999999999s)]
*  any and all cost. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=584.12s)]
*  Cenk, take it away. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=585.16s)]
*  Yeah, Dave Portnoy actually made [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=586.24s)]
*  a good point about this particular [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=587.8399999999999s)]
*  comment by Bessent. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  He's like, yeah, you're saying that [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=590.8s)]
*  people who are about to retire [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=592.56s)]
*  aren't going to panic over this [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  huge drop in the stock market and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=595.68s)]
*  hence their holdings. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=597.4s)]
*  He's like, brother, if you're as [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=599.24s)]
*  wealthy as Bessent is, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=600.88s)]
*  you might not panic. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=601.9599999999999s)]
*  And by the way, or Portnoy, right? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  And he says it, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=605.16s)]
*  and he's very frank about it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=605.8s)]
*  Said I lost 20 million, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=607.16s)]
*  that's 10 to 15% of my wealth, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=608.08s)]
*  I'm okay overall, right? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=609.6s)]
*  I hate it, but [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=610.96s)]
*  I'm okay overall. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=611.68s)]
*  He's like, the real problem is [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=613.0s)]
*  people who are about to retire, and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=614.04s)]
*  they're not going to be okay [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=615.88s)]
*  overall. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=617.24s)]
*  And so if you think in your la la [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=618.2s)]
*  land that they're going to look at [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=620.12s)]
*  that, I have a long term view on it [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=622.04s)]
*  because I'm a professional [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=623.8s)]
*  investor, and I know that that's [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=625.2s)]
*  going to stay there for a year or [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=626.96s)]
*  two years, and how are we doing [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=628.6s)]
*  over the market indexes over [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=630.2s)]
*  the five year period? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=631.6s)]
*  No, any rational person is going to [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=632.8s)]
*  see their 401k or their pensions or [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=634.92s)]
*  whatever it might be plummeting and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=637.24s)]
*  justifiably worry. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=639.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=641.6s)]
*  No normal human being wouldn't do [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=642.12s)]
*  that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=644.16s)]

*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=647.68s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l19LJypACv0&t=649.32s)]
