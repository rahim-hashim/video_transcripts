*  It is a very good name. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=74.04s)]
*  Yeah, and every time Iderola is a tough name. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  Not great. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=79.4s)]
*  All right, so of course, John's the host. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Damage Report, check that out every day at 1 o'clock Eastern. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=83.56s)]
*  And Yasmin's on Rebel HQ. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  Check that out every day on YouTube and host the Modern Context Podcast as well. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=89.0s)]
*  All right, guys, we got a big show ahead for you guys. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  In the second hour, actually, we're going to do a story about Trump's declining poll [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=95.55999999999999s)]
*  numbers and then how the economy is in trouble and he's trying to blame it on Biden. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=99.32s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  But the question we're asking today on tyt.com in a poll that we opened up for non-members [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=107.28s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=114.24s)]
*  I can vote on it is, is Trump going to get caught? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=115.72s)]
*  Okay, and by caught, I don't mean by the left, obviously, we already caught him for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  whatever it's worth, right? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=124.44s)]
*  But I mean by some of his voters, a significant block of his voters. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=125.64s)]
*  Are they going to realize, maybe this guy's a knucklehead, okay? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=129.56s)]
*  And there's a lot of stories in the show that relate to that, but especially the one [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=133.72s)]
*  about the economy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=137.4s)]
*  So go vote on that at tyt.com. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=138.68s)]
*  All right, meanwhile, we've got huge news on the defense budget. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=141.16s)]
*  We'll get to in a second. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=144.28s)]
*  Fetterman, that's a super tough story about Fetterman and so much more on the show. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=145.8s)]
*  And so let's just get to it because I know we're gonna run out of time as usual. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=153.72s)]
*  So John, take a look. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=157.08s)]
*  100%, and that one is gonna make me very uncomfortable even just to read the graphics. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=157.96s)]
*  But we'll get to Fetterman soon. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=162.44s)]
*  Let's start with this first. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=163.48s)]
*  Donald Trump came to Washington to cut, right? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=165.72s)]
*  Cut that budget, get rid of the waste and the fraud. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=168.28s)]
*  Well, when it comes to defense, not so much. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=171.0s)]
*  He's jacking that up, perhaps not surprisingly, requesting $1.1 trillion for defense. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=174.36s)]
*  And I made a point like this on TDR, but I wanna be clear. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=183.0s)]
*  It's not like the US doesn't have a military. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=186.68s)]
*  And he's like, let's get a military. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=190.52s)]
*  We're a country, we should have one. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=192.76s)]
*  I want $1.1 trillion for a military. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=194.04s)]
*  It's just for one year, like maintenance. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=198.04s)]
*  Paying your insurance on your car. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=201.32s)]
*  It's not like we pay the $1.1 trillion and then we're safe forever. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=203.96s)]
*  No, he's gonna request even more the year after that and the year after that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=207.96s)]
*  And there's a lot of ways to size this up for how ridiculous it is, how over the top it is. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=212.28s)]
*  I will say that last year, our defense spending, which was already comically high, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  nearly a trillion dollars even then, equated to about 37% of all global military expenditure. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=224.52s)]
*  So one third of what everyone has spent on the military. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=231.72s)]
*  And I looked it up and there are definitely more than three countries in the world. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=236.2s)]
*  So we are doing too much, I think. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=239.4s)]
*  Here's a chart that puts it in perspective. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=241.64s)]
*  That's last year. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=243.8s)]
*  So every other country on Earth is about a half in this measuring of it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=245.4s)]
*  And to put in perspective what we're adding to what we already did last year. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=250.84s)]
*  It's like if you took the entire military budget of India and the UK, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  and then put it on top of what we already led the world in as of just last year. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=259.8s)]
*  It's an insane amount of spending no matter how you measure it, Cenk. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=265.24s)]
*  And it certainly seems to blow a hole in the idea that he's for fiscal discipline. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=269.56s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple things here. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=273.8s)]
*  You went with India and UK. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=276.12s)]
*  Russia, we are adding more just this year to the Pentagon than the entire military budget of Russia, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=277.88s)]
*  which is in a massive war with Ukraine, let alone everything else that Russia has. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=286.12s)]
*  So that's amazing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, what's also amazing is, as a lot of you know, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=293.64s)]
*  at this moment on X where I asked them to cut the Pentagon budget, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=298.04s)]
*  I talked to Elon Musk. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=301.88s)]
*  But I say I talked to Elon Musk, it was just the X-posts, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=303.48s)]
*  And so Elon Musk was like, great, give me some suggestions. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=306.44s)]
*  And then Don Jr. jumped in and everybody was excited. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=309.24s)]
*  Then Heges said they were gonna cut and Fox News said they were gonna cut. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=312.04s)]
*  And Tim Pool and Patrick Bette David and everyone said we're gonna cut, we're gonna cut. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=315.48s)]
*  We're gonna cut. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=320.2s)]
*  Did you? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=321.8s)]
*  So look, did I think, I bet Elon and Donald Trump, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=323.88s)]
*  they're not gonna worry about corruption. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=329.72s)]
*  They're just gonna do the right thing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=332.36s)]
*  No, I voted against Trump. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=334.68s)]
*  Of course, he's not gonna do that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  He didn't do that in his first term. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=337.16s)]
*  He's not gonna do it this time. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=338.36s)]
*  And what did Elon want? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=340.12s)]
*  He wanted a lot of money from the government. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=341.32000000000005s)]
*  And by the way, that's also buried in this document, which we're gonna get to in a second, okay? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  And we're gonna get to how much they're taking from the rest of the budget [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=348.6s)]
*  so they could add pork to the Pentagon. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  But this is the moment when we ask our right-wing friends [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=356.04s)]
*  what happened, okay? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  Are you gonna hold them accountable? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=361.88000000000005s)]
*  Or are you just now gonna go, well, we said cut. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=363.72s)]
*  We all collectively clearly said cut, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=367.16s)]
*  On all of those shows and in all of social media, we all said cut. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  And the Pentagon can't pass an audit, etc. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=374.6s)]
*  But now we're gonna say what cut really meant add, and it meant add a lot. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  It meant take away from the average American and all the other things we're about to tell you about [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=383.32000000000005s)]
*  and give it to the military contractors who said, I don't know where the money is. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=387.8s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=393.16s)]
*  And they stuff it into their mouths and their pockets and get away with this kind of corruption. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  So look, the left wing is clear on this. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=398.36s)]
*  I think the independents will be fairly clear on this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  This one is on right-wingers. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=403.64s)]
*  Do you want this nonsense? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=406.6s)]
*  You said you didn't. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  So I don't know if you're ever gonna hold Trump accountable, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=409.8s)]
*  and I don't know how you would do that at this point. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=412.12s)]
*  But just at least I'm asking for a little bit of honesty [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=414.52s)]
*  that this is the exact opposite of what you claimed you wanted. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=418.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=422.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'll give you just a few more stats and then we'll throw to Tiaz for commentary. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=423.88s)]
*  But this is, by any measure, this is insane. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=427.48s)]
*  I know a lot of it needs to go to the border or whatever, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=430.84s)]
*  but are you building the border wall out of stacks of cash, tightly bundled? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=433.4s)]
*  Is that literally what you're building it out of? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=438.68s)]
*  Imagine thinking that America is so uniquely unsafe that we'll all die. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=441.0s)]
*  Our country will be gone unless we add $150 billion this year. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=446.68s)]
*  Fox News, how much they've whined about the money that was spent to keep Ukraine as a sovereign [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=451.08000000000004s)]
*  nation. This is way more than that. Not for a specific conflict, like an emergency, an act of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=456.28000000000003s)]
*  God. We just wanna do more of this and more of that, more of everything, literally, but complain [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=462.44s)]
*  more about Ukraine. And so absolutely insane spending. A bunch is gonna go to the Golden Dome. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=467.48s)]
*  Obviously, Donald Trump's idea to give, I don't know, billions of dollars to Elon Musk to stop [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=473.64000000000004s)]
*  satellites or to stop missiles or something. Nuclear modernization, shipbuilding, border [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  security. They say there's gonna be a military pay raise. That at least feels defensible considering [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  all of this. And as you pointed out, for seven straight years now, the Pentagon has failed to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=489.64000000000004s)]
*  pass an audit. My favorite part, perhaps, of this is that they're gonna put over $500 million [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=493.72s)]
*  into the next Pentagon audit. And the Pentagon is saying they're on track to not fail an audit [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=500.04s)]
*  by 2028. So we're gonna spend half a billion dollars to audit them this year and they're saying, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=507.0s)]
*  not even close. There's no way we're gonna pass that thing. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=512.6s)]
*  Then why even spend the money? It's absolutely insane. But we're gonna talk about the things [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=515.8000000000001s)]
*  that are cut to make way for this. And sure, $150 billion more, $1.1 trillion is a lot. But [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=521.24s)]
*  we're not gonna be spending $20,000 on a Chilean trans opera or whatever. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=527.8s)]
*  We won't spend 30 grand on a gay comic book. We'll just spend $150 billion on this and we'll [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=532.84s)]
*  consider ourselves to be very fiscally disciplined as a net result of all of that. But yes, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=538.76s)]
*  we've thrown a lot of numbers out there. What do you think? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=543.48s)]
*  Well, first of all, I just wanna say the golden dome is so funny to me because Trump is so [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=545.08s)]
*  obsessed with gold. It's weird, all the gilding of the White House and everything. Also, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=551.08s)]
*  I'm warm toned, I get it. I wear a lot of gold jewelry, but he's orange and the gold is just [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=556.76s)]
*  gonna make him look even more orange. So maybe no one's told him that before, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=561.88s)]
*  so I'm just gonna say it so that it has been said. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=566.36s)]
*  Anyway, as far as the military goes, am I missing something? Are we at war? Are we about to be? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  I guess we're always on the brink of some version of war. I know that we like to pretend, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=573.88s)]
*  do pretend versions of war where we just run military campaigns in other countries, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=579.16s)]
*  even though Congress never actually declares war. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=583.8s)]
*  And I know we're obviously doing all the stuff that Israel's doing. We are the funding behind [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=586.36s)]
*  all of that. But what is happening? What's happening is that we keep talking about [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=590.76s)]
*  defense contractors here. But what are defense contractors? Those are war profiteers, right? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=595.48s)]
*  This is nothing more than Trump and this administration enriching all of these [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=601.32s)]
*  military contractors at the expense of everyday Americans. And to be clear, I'm not against [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=605.08s)]
*  military upgrades. I know that they need maintenance and upgrades. That's totally normal. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  That's why we have annual budgets. And I'm certainly not against giving our service people [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=615.1600000000001s)]
*  raises. But the Pentagon, they can't even pass an audit. The money and the spending [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=619.5600000000001s)]
*  is unaccounted for here. And for an administration that claims to be so transparent, where is the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=624.84s)]
*  transparency and is it ever gonna come? Because they keep not passing their audits and then [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=631.24s)]
*  nothing happens. So until there's some kind of accountability, I don't think anything's [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=636.44s)]
*  gonna change. And for some reason, a lot of Republicans are supporting all of this, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=640.44s)]
*  even though the numbers are astronomical. They're comical, right? It's ridiculous. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=645.16s)]
*  What is it? 30 something percent of spending. So where's the money going? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=649.8s)]
*  Yeah, just a couple of quick things on what Yaz is saying. Really great points. First, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=656.52s)]
*  Golden Dome, super important. That is a boondoggle project that has no chance of working. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=661.32s)]
*  It will be a giant waste of money. And as we reported on here earlier on the Young Turks, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  guess who's likely to get the contract for Golden Dome? SpaceX, huh? Interesting. An Elon company. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=673.08s)]
*  So what happened, Elon? As Zerocana said the other day in the congressional hearings, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=680.84s)]
*  where's Elon? You said there's gonna be cuts, where's Elon? Okay, so we're not cutting, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=686.12s)]
*  but we're adding to your company. Massive, massive contracts, potentially to Elon Musk's company. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=691.72s)]
*  So well, look, if you think about it, you could say he's a good smart businessman. He bribes, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=699.0s)]
*  I mean, gives campaign contributions to Donald Trump to the tune of about $300 million. That is [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=703.64s)]
*  a lot of money. Are you sure he's a good businessman? Well, he might get back $300 billion. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=709.16s)]
*  So that would be an amazing return on investment. Corruption works in this country. By the way, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=715.48s)]
*  why is most of the pork at the Pentagon? And why is the Pentagon the one department they can't pass [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=720.52s)]
*  on audit? Because it's the convenient place where you go, you can't look there. It endangers us all. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=725.4s)]
*  If you cut the Pentagon, we're all gonna die. So that's why we have to add pork and pork and pork. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=732.52s)]
*  And you can't see where it is. If you question it, you're all gonna die. That's why they put it [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=738.28s)]
*  in there. If you put it in the Department of Education, people would be like, well, how much [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=743.8s)]
*  education do we need, right? But if you put it in the Pentagon, they can do the fair market. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=746.76s)]
*  Okay, and one more thing that Yas brought up. She said, are we about to go into a massive war? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=751.0s)]
*  Actually, we might be. And that might be another reason they're adding to the Pentagon. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=757.16s)]
*  Because in a story later in the show, and by the way, watch the show live, 6 to 8 PM Eastern, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=761.16s)]
*  get all the news. Trump's organization has done a $5.5 billion deal with the Saudis and Qatar. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=765.64s)]
*  Wait, what does that have to do with war? What is the one thing Israel, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=774.52s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, and Qatar agree on? The US should attack Iran. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=778.04s)]
*  So now Trump just got bribed, I mean, made a business deal with those two countries. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=782.84s)]
*  So maybe they're gearing up for the war that Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Israel purchased [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=788.0400000000001s)]
*  through Trump. So there's no good news coming out of this at all. By the way, I challenge the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=796.6s)]
*  right wing. I will give two people a tiny bit of credit here. Okay, my left-wing friends, get ready [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=802.9200000000001s)]
*  to get triggered, okay? Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker Carlson, both going on huge tirades. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=809.1600000000001s)]
*  Do not go to war with Iran. We said anti-war, we meant anti-war. The base hates this, okay? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=816.04s)]
*  So I know the base also, at least they claim to hate the addition to the Pentagon. Whether they [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=825.0s)]
*  actually do, we'll find out. Whether Marjorie Taylor Greene hates the addition to the Pentagon [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=830.5999999999999s)]
*  and Tom Massey and others do, we'll find out, right? But I am worried that part of the reason [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=834.36s)]
*  they're loading up here is so that they can do what the donors want, which is for us to die [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=839.7199999999999s)]
*  in other countries' wars. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=845.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and even if we don't end up dying in other countries' wars, those donors, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=846.52s)]
*  including the contractors, they get the money. A couple more numbers before we go to the cutting [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=850.52s)]
*  part of this. $14 trillion spent by the Pentagon since the beginning of the war in Afghanistan, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=855.48s)]
*  $14 trillion. They say, a great new deal, unrealistic. How could we ever spend like $2 trillion [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=862.28s)]
*  to stop our civilization from being destroyed or whatever? $14 trillion to start and kind of lose [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=869.64s)]
*  a few wars. That's great, great use of money. And a large portion of it goes to just a few [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=877.8000000000001s)]
*  corporations, one quarter to one third in recent years of all Pentagon contracts have gone to [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=882.5200000000001s)]
*  Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Raytheon, or Northrop Grumman. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=888.2s)]
*  So they're making huge money, whether we go to war or not. They get the money. It's 1.1 trillion [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  this year. What is it gonna be next year? Is it gonna be 1.2? The year after that, 1.3, 1.4. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=898.52s)]
*  We'd have a $1.5 trillion budget within a few years. And the amazing things about this is, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=903.16s)]
*  as we're about to show you, if you wanna come in and you wanna cut the CDC by 50% or education [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=907.16s)]
*  by 30%, whatever, you can do it. You literally just have to say DEI and it's gone, perhaps never [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=913.24s)]
*  to return. But when you add money to the defense budget, do you know how utterly difficult it is [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=919.0s)]
*  gonna be to ever cut that? Never mind the fact that the defense budget was 800 billion just a [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=925.64s)]
*  couple of years ago. Now that it's 1.1 trillion, if AOC comes in and says, I'm gonna cut it back [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=930.68s)]
*  down to 800 billion, every single anchor will be like, you are going to kill America. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=936.12s)]
*  We will be instantly invaded by Guatemala or whatever and then that'll be it. Because they [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=942.28s)]
*  just lock it in and that's why it always goes up never to go down again, utterly demoralizing. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=947.0s)]
*  But let's talk about the cuts that they can make. So at the exact same time that Donald Trump is [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=953.8s)]
*  pitching by far the biggest military budget the world has ever seen. He also wants to slash the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=959.16s)]
*  portion of government spending that theoretically could benefit you or your family or your town or [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=965.0s)]
*  your small business. He wants to cut discretionary federal spending by about 25%. So biggest ever [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=970.3599999999999s)]
*  defense budget, biggest ever cuts to domestic spending in the exact same year. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=978.52s)]
*  Hey, and at the same time, perhaps biggest tax pay off to the wealthiest Americans in the world. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=983.96s)]
*  Huge tax cuts for them, huge corporate tax cuts. This is sort of shaping out exactly how we said. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=989.56s)]
*  And let's talk a little bit about how they got to some of this cuts. Now, as I have alluded to on [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1008.52s)]
*  the show, the argument is always going to be we can cut any program we want because of DEI. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1019.24s)]
*  And that's what they're saying in this case. It's DEI and race theory programs. That's what [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1024.6s)]
*  they're gonna be cutting, which means steep cuts to USAID, the EPA, the NIH, the CDC, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1028.92s)]
*  the Department of Education. In some cases, 30 plus percent of these entire government departments [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1035.56s)]
*  disappearing. And you might be thinking at this point, wait, 30% of the CDC was DEI? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1043.0s)]
*  No, of course not. But that's the excuse that they're using to cut all this NIH. It was obviously [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1048.6799999999998s)]
*  40% woke. Department of Education, 30 to 40% woke, gotta get rid of the entire thing. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1053.0s)]
*  And so that's what they're doing. And also NOAA, our ability to track hurricanes, FEMA, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1057.8s)]
*  massive cuts, our ability to respond to hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, all of that. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1063.0s)]
*  All of these, I mean, list a program. It has been drastically cut. And at the same time that they [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1068.84s)]
*  will tell you we are now finally safe militarily thanks to our $1.1 trillion defense budget, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1074.04s)]
*  you were obviously far more likely to suffer from a natural disaster, a measles outbreak. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1079.96s)]
*  And the list goes on and on. And we are now in no way prepared to deal with those far more likely [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1086.04s)]
*  domestic public health and other crises. Okay, so more context. For non-defense entities, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1091.32s)]
*  so Department of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, etc., when you take just non-defense [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1098.76s)]
*  into account, it's actually a 35% cut. So it's as if he's trying to prove Dwight Eisenhower right. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1104.6s)]
*  Eisenhower, in his farewell speech, warned about the military industrial complex. And he said, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1113.96s)]
*  for every gun that we buy, that is bread and butter off of our table. I'm paraphrasing, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1118.76s)]
*  obviously. And it is food that our families can have, that our children can have. It's education, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1124.68s)]
*  it's all those things will be sacrificed at the altar of the military industrial complex. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1131.16s)]
*  And Trump's like, that's a really good idea. Let's do that. Why don't you guys, instead of having 30 [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1135.72s)]
*  Barbies, have two or something. And all the prices will go up and all you'll have, and your kids [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1141.72s)]
*  won't get educated. And we'll just steal from the average man. And then we'll just give it to the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1146.28s)]
*  military industrial complex. And my donors, who bribed me, I mean gave me campaign contributions, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1151.08s)]
*  and bribe me, I mean gave money into my Trump organization and Trump media and Trump meme coin, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1157.48s)]
*  etc. No, it was a warning you schmuck. It wasn't a how to manual. So now, you know how much they're [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1163.72s)]
*  cutting from all those essential programs? Overall, $163 billion. And how much are they [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1171.48s)]
*  adding to defense? $150 billion. So for all of those, Dodge, we're making cuts, bad cuts. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1178.52s)]
*  You know what? You don't need no stinking education. Your kids are gonna go straight into [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1186.1200000000001s)]
*  the coal mines and assembly lines anyway. And in Florida, we just passed a bill saying that [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1189.96s)]
*  children can work overnight on school days. Okay, great. Yes, America, you're screwed. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1194.76s)]
*  That was populism. This is populism. Come on, guys. Come on, this is nowhere near populism. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1202.84s)]
*  So he's robbing from the average American to give it all to defense and potentially to Golden Dome [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1210.2s)]
*  so that Elon can have a slightly larger lead on Jeff Bezos on the richest man competition. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1217.4s)]
*  Wow, what a populist. I told you, utter fraud. He at least had enough sense to pretend to be a [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1224.12s)]
*  populist, but he's been a fake populist all along. The only thing he did last time was add to defense, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1232.28s)]
*  more tax cuts, giant gifts to corporations. Same exact thing now, just on bigger steroids. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1237.56s)]
*  Been a fraud his entire life, yes. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1244.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, the saddest part about all of this is that, first of all, maybe I'm just personally [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1247.8000000000002s)]
*  too fiscally conservative. But if I'm watching the economy and I'm seeing other nations drop [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1252.8400000000001s)]
*  our treasury bonds, the strength of the dollar, it's all a little tenuous right now. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1258.2s)]
*  If these were my personal finances, I would be clutching my purse a little bit instead of [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1263.4s)]
*  inflating these budgets the way they are. But what do I know? But also, it genuinely just makes me [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1267.48s)]
*  sad to think about how better this money could be spent. Not to be all bleeding heart lefty over [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1272.68s)]
*  here, but it really breaks my heart to see all the programs that are going to see massive budget [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1279.4s)]
*  cuts, some of which will be so massive that the programs won't be able to function properly. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1284.76s)]
*  They're going to be utterly defunct. And then, as John pointed out, it's gonna be very, very [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1289.5600000000002s)]
*  difficult in the future to reinstate these programs and to get all of these people back, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1294.28s)]
*  people who have been in these positions for years. They have expertise, they have tenure there. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1299.4s)]
*  They're gonna be very, very difficult to replace. All of it are things that don't even need to [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1304.1200000000001s)]
*  happen. So just that alone feels very, very wasteful, just the time and the effort that is [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1309.4s)]
*  gonna be going to waste for that. And then all the people who are going to suffer without these [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1315.16s)]
*  programs in the meantime, and that's not anything to be dismissive of, right? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1318.76s)]
*  Right now in the country, most Americans can't get by for very long without, if they miss one [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1322.68s)]
*  or two paychecks, losing money from certain programs that a lot of Americans depend on, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1328.28s)]
*  we're talking like SNAP and Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, those types of things. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1332.92s)]
*  People are going to suffer, people are gonna lose their homes and things like that. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1337.56s)]
*  And whenever the left has been talking about Trump's rhetoric all along, since he came out [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1340.92s)]
*  and we were saying that these words that he's saying are dangerous, and dangerous words can [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1346.52s)]
*  often lead to dangerous actions, people said that we were overreacting. And I feel like the only [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1351.24s)]
*  reason that they were saying that is because they just couldn't see the writing on the wall yet. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1355.8s)]
*  But here we are today, Republicans have spent the last ten years demonizing public education [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1361.0s)]
*  at the grade school level and also at the university level. They've called Social Security [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1367.32s)]
*  and Medicaid entitlements. They've talked about rampant gang violence and terrorism, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1371.3999999999999s)]
*  and all of these talking points were seeds that they were planting in order to garner support [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1375.8799999999999s)]
*  for all of the things that they're now enacting and implementing on the American people. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1380.6s)]
*  And that's why they can get away with things, even teasing [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1385.0s)]
*  martial law on the American people and saying, yeah, maybe we will turn the military against [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1388.52s)]
*  the American citizens. And that's how they can say, look, we need this inflated military budget, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1393.5600000000002s)]
*  because who knows what's gonna happen? And really, who knows what's gonna happen? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1398.2s)]
*  At this point, it could be anything. Yeah, 100%. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1402.04s)]
*  Yeah, but good news, guys. We're also gonna spend about $100 million on a military parade [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1404.28s)]
*  on Trump's birthday. But Doge just couldn't find a way to cut that. They're like, no, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1410.2s)]
*  it's really necessary. It happens to be a lucky break that it's the Army's 250th anniversary, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1416.2s)]
*  and Trump's gonna use that as an excuse to celebrate himself. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1422.1200000000001s)]
*  And one of our members wrote, and I totally agree, why don't his donors who love to kiss his ass [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1425.4s)]
*  pay for his military parade instead of us? So MAGA should be asking the same thing, okay? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1432.2s)]
*  Hey, you wanna celebrate yourself with big toys? Yeah, you know what? Your kids can't get 30 [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1437.32s)]
*  toys anymore. They can only get two. But Trump's gonna get all the toys, right? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1443.0s)]
*  50 helicopters. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1446.36s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, why don't you take the money that you're making from Saudi Arabia, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1447.3999999999999s)]
*  however many billions of dollars you're getting from that corrupt deal and use it for your [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1451.6399999999999s)]
*  birthday military parade? No, constantly stealing from the American people. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1455.96s)]
*  It's disgusting, I can't stand it. And so he's gonna get caught. So at some point, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1461.8000000000002s)]
*  people are gonna realize, right, he didn't cut anything. Right, they're gonna do a $5 [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1468.44s)]
*  trillion tax cut. Right, he added to the deficit again. They never, ever, ever balanced the budget. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1473.3200000000002s)]
*  They never actually do real cuts. All they ever do is more pork barrel spending for their stupid [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1480.1200000000001s)]
*  donors. So look, we need a real populist revolt in this country. I'm sick of all this. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1486.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, even as they have their doggy, they're gonna add massively the deficit and [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1493.0800000000002s)]
*  the national debt, proving that it was never about waste, physical discipline. It's just more culture [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1498.1200000000001s)]
*  war wedge issue. Yes, I almost swore, I apologize. The entire thing's frustrating. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1502.8400000000001s)]
*  We're gonna take a short break. Lots more to get to after this. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1507.0800000000002s)]
*  All right, back on TYT. Cenk, John and Yaz with you guys and also Steelers Dragon upgraded their [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1516.92s)]
*  membership through the join button. I love that in two different ways. Thank you for supporting [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1533.3200000000002s)]
*  the show, makes a huge difference. It really does. And I love your handle, obviously. All right, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1537.5600000000002s)]
*  I bet everyone doesn't mind it either. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1542.76s)]
*  Well, let's jump back into some more news. We've been teasing this story. It's time to talk about [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1545.0s)]
*  it. This week it was revealed that even as he holds the White House, Donald Trump apparently [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1548.44s)]
*  secured a deal to build a massive golf course as part of a $5.5 billion development in Qatar. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1554.28s)]
*  And that's a big project. It's gonna be a ton of money. And his organization, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1562.28s)]
*  the Trump Organization, is going to be making that money. Now, in Donald Trump's defense, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1567.96s)]
*  he didn't even do the thing he did in his first term where he pretended he wouldn't do foreign [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1573.88s)]
*  deals or whatever. He knows that there's no reason to limit himself in that way now. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1579.08s)]
*  And so he's gonna make potentially hundreds of millions, maybe even more on this as the first [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1582.8400000000001s)]
*  of what could be multiple projects across the region. And this is just the most high profile [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1588.68s)]
*  and new bit of petty little personal corruption that he's been doing. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1594.68s)]
*  We have a lot of others that I wanna remind you of. But first, Cenk, I know you've mentioned this [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1598.44s)]
*  particular golf course project. Yeah, so the Saudis have been funneling the Trump family money for a [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1603.8s)]
*  long time. Jared Kushner got the 2 billion. And look, I felt alone in the golf course thing. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1609.88s)]
*  I'm like, is no one seeing that this whole live golf thing is about making sure that they [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1616.1200000000001s)]
*  play on Trump's golf courses and funneling a huge amount of money to Trump? Is everybody missing [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1622.68s)]
*  that? Well, if you were missing that, you're not gonna miss the $5.5 billion. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1628.92s)]
*  Yes. That are getting funneled to him here. And then I wanna talk a little bit later about why might [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1633.0800000000002s)]
*  they be doing this? What is it that they really, really want out of Trump? That's very important. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1641.16s)]
*  But first, let's talk about the record breaking corruption. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1647.0s)]
*  I think they just appreciate his style. He knows how to set up a golf course. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1651.72s)]
*  Amazing immaculate landscaping. Big things, bolded palaces. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1655.9599999999998s)]
*  Gold, yeah, no, billions of dollars. Remember when the right was like, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1660.6s)]
*  I think Hunter Biden got $5 million and they couldn't prove it, but they said that that would [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1664.6799999999998s)]
*  be reason enough to go Biden. This is billions of dollars. Colmer, you gonna comment on it? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1668.52s)]
*  Not so much. But anyway, that's the most recent one. Bear in mind, maybe the single most corrupt [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1674.4399999999998s)]
*  enterprise that has ever existed in America before would be Trump's crypto venture. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1680.68s)]
*  Because of the ability to funnel domestically or internationally, literally untraceable billions [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1685.3200000000002s)]
*  of dollars to Donald Trump for him to profit from. Well, he has already raised more than [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1691.0s)]
*  $550 million by selling tokens to buyers around the world, which is great because he hands over [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1696.28s)]
*  a token, which is nothing. It's meaningless and he gets over a half a billion dollars from that. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1703.88s)]
*  It's amazing. He doesn't even have to build a building or anything. There was an investigation [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1708.12s)]
*  by the New York Times that found that World Liberty Financial, that's his crypto platform, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1711.8799999999999s)]
*  solicited secret multi-million dollar payments from other crypto startups as well, offering [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1715.9599999999998s)]
*  cross promotion and perceived proximity to Donald Trump. So they handed over millions of dollars [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1720.52s)]
*  to influence the president. Now, one would typically think of that as being the sort of [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1727.4799999999998s)]
*  thing you do under the American structure of legalized bribery of donations to his campaign. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1731.7199999999998s)]
*  This is just directly money to him. And I don't understand how any of that's legal. I keep saying [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1737.8000000000002s)]
*  that I keep bringing this up and it's legal. You can just give Donald Trump millions and millions [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1744.3600000000001s)]
*  and millions of dollars and it's nothing. I don't understand what campaign finance restrictions are [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1750.28s)]
*  for. If AOC wants to do a corruption, why would you cut her campaign a check and possibly end up [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1756.6000000000001s)]
*  in jail? Just have her release a meme coin and then give her $100 million. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1762.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's- [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1765.64s)]
*  It sounds like I'm asking a rhetorical question. I literally have never gotten an answer as to how [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1767.24s)]
*  any of this is legal. Look, that's why I think he's gonna get caught. That's our poll on tyt.com for [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1770.8400000000001s)]
*  the whole show on every topic. Is Trump gonna get caught? Because so look, if the economy is booming [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1776.2800000000002s)]
*  and people are generally happy, he's not gonna get caught. He didn't get caught last time because [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1782.92s)]
*  the economy was relatively okay. Why did I think he didn't screw it up in the first three years [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1788.1200000000001s)]
*  of his ministry? He screwed up a thousand things, but not the economy to be fair, right? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1794.68s)]
*  And so it's because he had the establishment as a brakes in the car. So they would just say, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1798.6000000000001s)]
*  okay, no, no, no, no, we're not gonna do that. That's really you're an idiot. No, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1803.88s)]
*  we're not doing that, right? In this time, there is no establishment and I don't like the establishment, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1807.3200000000002s)]
*  but cars need brakes, right? So since there's no brakes in the car, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1813.3200000000002s)]
*  he's gonna screw up the economy as he's doing now. He's gonna screw up foreign policy as he's [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1817.64s)]
*  doing now. And then people are gonna get super frustrated and they didn't vote for this kind [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1821.48s)]
*  of madness, right? And then they're gonna come back and go, wait, he took five and a half billion [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1825.96s)]
*  dollars from the Saudis? When people were taking money from Israel, we had a whole bunch of excuses, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1832.44s)]
*  or special ally, the most moral army, whatever. I mean, they're nonsense, but mainstream media [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1839.0s)]
*  has been doing that propaganda for so long that a lot of people believe it. But when you go, no, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1845.0s)]
*  no, the Saudis are actually good guys. America's gonna go, bruv. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1848.92s)]
*  Really? You're gonna sell me on how the Saudi dictator who chopped up the Washington Post [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1854.44s)]
*  reporter is golden hearted and that's why he just wanted to give Trump billions of dollars for [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1859.8799999999999s)]
*  nothing? And how about the guy who was being investigated by the SEC and put $75 million [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1865.16s)]
*  into Trump's media company? A totally utterly worthless media company. To give you a sense of [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1871.16s)]
*  how ridiculous their valuations and all that stuff is. This isn't even the meme coin. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1876.52s)]
*  The meme coin is like, this is nothing. This is a piece of paper. Now give me billion dollars. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1880.36s)]
*  People are like, yeah, sure, here you go, here you go, right? But the media company puts $75 million [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1887.0s)]
*  in. If that media company is worth what it's worth, then the Turks is worth close to a trillion [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1891.48s)]
*  dollars. Like vis-a-vis the view count, the revenue, all those things. Come on, guys. This [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1897.48s)]
*  is insanity. It's just out and out corruption. Just so when like left wing can get quite mad, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1905.4s)]
*  sometimes we have a tiny amount of power. But watch out when the right wing gets mad, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1916.2800000000002s)]
*  right? And I know now I'm going crazy. Right wing's gonna get mad at Trump. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1922.2800000000002s)]
*  It's not gonna happen tomorrow. But a year and a half in two and a half, three and a half, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1927.88s)]
*  and somebody's gonna turn back around and go, wait a minute, how much did the Saudis give you? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1932.36s)]
*  And what did they give it to you for? This brother's gonna get caught in a terrible way [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1939.08s)]
*  cuz he thinks there's no rules left. They tried to prosecute him. They couldn't prosecute him. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1945.7199999999998s)]
*  He's been above the law his whole life. So he's thinking, so what? You know what? I'll [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1949.9599999999998s)]
*  hire you a goddamn sign saying, this is an auction. Give me money, I will give you US [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1954.9199999999998s)]
*  foreign policy. And he thinks he can get away with it. And for now, he would get away with it. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1962.6s)]
*  Two and a half years from now, let's find out. All right, what do you think, yes? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1967.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it will be interesting. And I know that none of us can wait for that day whenever it [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1971.8s)]
*  finally comes. We've been waiting for a long time, even before he was president, right? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1977.3999999999999s)]
*  But I mean, they don't call him Teflon Dunn for nothing because there's always a loophole. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1981.32s)]
*  There's always a scapegoat or it's just no recourse, right? And people who live lives [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1985.72s)]
*  without any kind of recourse, they are different people. They think differently than the rest of [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1990.68s)]
*  us. They operate, they make decisions differently than the rest of us, right? There's no one to hold [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1994.84s)]
*  him accountable right now. The Supreme Court gave him merely king-like protections. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=1999.0s)]
*  And then they wondered why he doesn't honor their rulings. It makes no sense. And [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2003.8s)]
*  I hate to generalize, but as far as why his base still stands behind and why he still has support, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2008.6000000000001s)]
*  the thing is, again, I don't wanna generalize. But the thing with his base is that the most maga [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2014.68s)]
*  of them, they really just don't have the morals and the values that they pretend to have. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2019.96s)]
*  And I know they don't because those things are felt on principle. And principles are largely, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2024.3600000000001s)]
*  not completely static, right? It's not a principle if you care about it when someone you don't like [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2030.1200000000001s)]
*  does it, but you don't mind it if it's your guy. So they don't actually care about government [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2035.56s)]
*  officials enriching themselves in ways like this, unless it's Trump. So that's not a principle. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2040.6s)]
*  Trump is a con man and these are the same people who have celebrated his genius, right? In running [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2046.12s)]
*  cons, oftentimes on them, they're the ones that he's conning, right? But when capital is king [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2051.7999999999997s)]
*  in this country, which it is, corruption becomes justified. Not only that, but it's probably [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2057.4s)]
*  celebrated, right? All that you see is that Trump is winning at capitalism and they're here to [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2062.28s)]
*  support that because, I don't know, they wanna get on his good side or something. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2067.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, the entire thing is just wild. And it makes it even funnier that Dinesh D'Souza [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2070.2000000000003s)]
*  went to prison for violence. You could have just handed him a billion dollars in full public view [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2075.88s)]
*  and you found the one way that could get you locked up, what a dink. But anyway, just really [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2080.92s)]
*  fast to remind you of some of the other corruption. We don't have time to break into all this, but [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2085.8s)]
*  his own personal meme coins, we talked about his platform. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2089.48s)]
*  That was meme coin surged more than 60% last week after he advertised that the top coin holders [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2092.44s)]
*  would get an intimate private dinner, which he hasn't even had with Melania for years, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2099.56s)]
*  as well as a White House tour. So now he is pimping out his house, the president's house, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2104.04s)]
*  as a reward for you buying his meme coin. His son, of course, they launched this exclusive [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2112.2000000000003s)]
*  DC club that's gonna make them millions and millions of dollars just because they're [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2117.0s)]
*  advertising it as hey, you can hang out with Trump officials. So again, utterly corrupt personal [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2121.0s)]
*  profit off of this. Dominarry Holdings is a small public financial services company [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2125.56s)]
*  that Don Jr. and Eric Trump joined the advisory board of. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2131.16s)]
*  They got steak worth millions of dollars and the stock price went up 1200% in six weeks, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2135.0s)]
*  I guess because they're really good at investments, I suppose. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2140.6s)]
*  And he's also, Don Jr. is also on the board of a digital firearms retailer called [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2143.64s)]
*  Grab a Gun that's due to go public this summer, again, cashing in on his name, his proximity to [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2150.68s)]
*  Donald Trump. There's 19 foreign Trump branded projects in development over the next four years. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2156.2s)]
*  The golf course thing is just one. Again, maybe I'm hyperbolic, maybe I've Trumped Arrangement [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2161.88s)]
*  Syndrome. If you added up all of the corruption in the history of American politics, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2167.64s)]
*  all of it, I don't think it matches what Donald Trump and his family are doing this term alone. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2173.24s)]
*  No, I don't think that's hyperbolic at all. Last two quick things for me. Well, look, I [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2178.2s)]
*  understand what you're saying, Yaz, about MAGA and principles and stuff. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2183.0s)]
*  I have said it 100 times, I hear you. On the other hand, I don't love blaming the voters because [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2186.2799999999997s)]
*  they're all getting misled by the media that they're watching. And does our side do it too? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2191.08s)]
*  Well, I remember our moderate friends on the Democratic side who told us that Biden and [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2196.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris's Israel policy was perfectly fine because it wasn't Trump. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2200.28s)]
*  No, these principles matter. They were wrong, Trump is even more wrong on Israel, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2205.96s)]
*  but you've got to be able to call out your own side. So we've also had issues with that. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2211.0800000000004s)]
*  And I'm curious to see what percentage of Trump voters will say, yeah, I said drain the swamp, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2215.96s)]
*  and this is filling the swamp with Saudi and Qatari money, and I'm not interested in it. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2223.88s)]
*  We don't know yet, we'll see, and we should hold all of them accountable. We should hold [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2228.84s)]
*  every politician accountable and leaders accountable. And then I promise you guys, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2232.2000000000003s)]
*  why is Saudi Arabia and Qatar putting so much money into Trump? That's what I'm most worried [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2236.44s)]
*  about. Guys, there's one thing that his three major foreign government donors agree with, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2240.84s)]
*  right? And want, most of all from America. The three major donors are Israel, Qatar, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2247.6400000000003s)]
*  and Saudi Arabia. And they all have the common enemy, Iran. They all want us to attack Iran [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2254.84s)]
*  and fight that war on behalf of them. So buckle up, brace for impact. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2263.8s)]
*  And that's why, guys, the right wing said they were anti-war. We need to put them to the test, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2270.2000000000003s)]
*  but not in a ha ha taunting way. But in like Marjorie Taylor Greene just did it today and then [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2275.1600000000003s)]
*  I replied to her, she replied to me on X, right? Saying yes, let's work together to make sure we [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2280.68s)]
*  do not go to war with Iran. Now she's not gonna agree that Donald Trump is corrupt and I'm not [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2287.48s)]
*  gonna agree to any of her other policies. But we all have to get together and say, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2291.96s)]
*  no, I don't care how much Qatar wants us to go die in Iran on their behalf. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2296.2s)]
*  I'm not Qatari royalty. I'm not a Saudi prince. I'm not a terrorist like Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2303.56s)]
*  I don't care about how you want us to die for you and to spend trillions of dollars fighting [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2311.64s)]
*  your wars cuz you bribed our president. No thank you to all three of those countries. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2317.64s)]
*  So no war with Iran. The most important thing is, look, is he ever gonna be held accountable? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2323.0s)]
*  We don't know. He hasn't been held accountable his whole life as we just discussed. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2329.4s)]
*  But even more important than that is the bribe can't work. If it works and Trump makes us go [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2334.52s)]
*  fight their war, that is the biggest disaster of all. And that is where we all need to unite [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2341.0s)]
*  as a country. All right, we gotta take a quick break here. We'll be right back. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2346.28s)]
*  All right, back on the TYT Power Panel, Cenk Yaz and John, what do you guys, John's got the next story. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2359.4s)]
*  That music was so, I don't know, it was almost like Mr. Rogers considering how serious this [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2373.88s)]
*  stuff is, but I like it. Maybe he's trying to get everyone to cool out a little bit. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2380.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2383.32s)]
*  Good, and I'm glad we had that chill moment. And let's talk now about John Fetterman and ruin it. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2383.8s)]
*  But anyway, let's jump into this. New York Magazine has released a long expose and sort [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2388.84s)]
*  of dive into the history of the last few years of John Fetterman. And what they found was [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2393.88s)]
*  disturbing. The reporting is disturbing. For me personally, reading this is disturbing and [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2398.36s)]
*  it will likely be disturbing for you to hear both in terms of his health as well as some of the [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2403.4s)]
*  things he said about notable topics in foreign policy, particularly what he wants to happen to [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2407.88s)]
*  Palestinians. And so it's very in-depth and very long. You should go read the entire thing [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2413.08s)]
*  on New York Magazine. But some of the highlights include a look back from the beginning of when he [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2417.4s)]
*  had his stroke months before being elected to the Senate in 2022. There were a lot of claims made [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2422.36s)]
*  about his health coming out of that, but not a lot of good reporting. It turns out that now, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2427.2400000000002s)]
*  those who are around him say that it affected him more strongly than people perhaps knew publicly. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2431.7200000000003s)]
*  And in fact, that eventually led to his chief of staff leaving. And in May of 2024, that former [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2437.88s)]
*  chief of staff, Adam Gentleson, wrote a letter to the doctor who had overseen Fetterman's care [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2443.48s)]
*  at Walter Reed saying, I think John is on a bad trajectory and I'm really worried about him. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2448.2s)]
*  If things didn't change, he said, he was concerned Fetterman quote, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2453.72s)]
*  won't be with us for much longer, which is obviously very serious. And he listed a number [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2456.84s)]
*  of reasons why he believed that. He said, we do not know if he's taking his meds and his behavior [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2461.88s)]
*  frequently suggests he is not. We often see the kind of warning signs we discussed, conspiratorial [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2467.08s)]
*  thinking, megalomania. For example, he claims to be the most knowledgeable source on Israel and [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2472.76s)]
*  Gaza around, but his sources are just what he reads in the news. He declines most briefings [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2477.4s)]
*  and never reads memos that all reads sort of like uncomfortably close to Donald Trump actually. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2482.6800000000003s)]
*  Long rambling, repetitive and self-centered monologues, also Trumpian, lying in ways that [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2489.2400000000002s)]
*  are painfully awkwardly obvious to everyone in the room. Maybe Trump had a really bad stroke, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2494.76s)]
*  I don't know. But anyway, he apparently at one point drove his car so recklessly, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2500.84s)]
*  according to Gentleson, that staff refused to ride with him. He had also bought a gun. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2504.6800000000003s)]
*  At one point, he was walking and seemed incapable of seeing that a crowd of people were in front [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2510.2000000000003s)]
*  of him, so he just barreled through them. He at one point walked into traffic and was nearly hit [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2515.96s)]
*  by a car. And there are a lot of examples like that provided in the expose from people around him. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2522.2000000000003s)]
*  By the way, in February 2023, he was readmitted to Walter Reed. And during the first few days [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2528.44s)]
*  in the hospital, he apparently was experiencing delusions. He thought that if he took a bed at [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2533.0s)]
*  the hospital, he would be arrested. He told doctors that he believed members of his family [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2537.56s)]
*  were wearing wires to secretly record him. And he also grew convinced that a political [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2541.4s)]
*  rally was being held in the hospital's lobby, and they needed a break out of his room to attend it. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2545.96s)]
*  He ended up staying there for six weeks, which is significant and coming out of it. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2551.32s)]
*  He said that he was put on a psychiatric treatment plan, which seemed to help improve [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2555.16s)]
*  significantly. Although eventually, concerns started to arise amongst the staffers [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2559.32s)]
*  that he was not staying on track with that, not taking it seriously. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2563.48s)]
*  The big issue seemed to be October 7th, seemed to be some sort of trigger, perhaps in terms of [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2567.48s)]
*  social media. There's a through line in this expose about his propensity for a massive [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2572.28s)]
*  periods of doom scrolling. And just being on Twitter basically all day long, getting his [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2577.56s)]
*  news from there, responding to it and spiraling into very dark depths of what are referred to in [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2583.32s)]
*  the article as depression. But we have more on that, I've already thrown out a lot. It is concerning. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2588.36s)]
*  Yeah, I have kind of an ironic take on this story. But first, just to clarify a couple things. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2594.52s)]
*  So he bought a gun, that's not that unusual. The reason why it's mentioned in this story is because [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2603.0s)]
*  his doctor told his staffers, let us know if he buys a gun, right? Because they're concerned [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2607.48s)]
*  about his mental health. So when he did buy the gun, they let the doctors know. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2613.0s)]
*  And the doom scrolling, guys, that's not just Federman. Please stop doom scrolling. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2619.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2624.04s)]
*  Please, please, please. You ruin your mental health, doesn't hurt Trump, it helps Trump. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2624.28s)]
*  So what's the point, right? Let's do something productive, whether it's Rebellion Pack or any [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2632.36s)]
*  other thing that you think is right, right? That way you feel better because you're actually doing [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2637.48s)]
*  something to take power away from Trump. But just getting down, I mean, it doesn't help anyone. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2642.04s)]
*  Okay, now back to Federman, it's a super important story. Look, my ironic take is that now I feel [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2647.48s)]
*  I'm gonna beat up on Federman less, okay? He's just the worst on the Israel-Gaza issue. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2653.96s)]
*  It's unbearable, right? But this brother's not well. You read the whole piece, I don't [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2660.44s)]
*  think there's any question at all. I mean, he thinks there's a press conference in the hallway [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2667.0s)]
*  in the hospital. There's no press conference that is, like all of that. No, no, he is not mentally [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2671.88s)]
*  well. So that leads to two conclusions. One is, okay, now I feel like, number one, I understand [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2677.8s)]
*  what happened a little bit better, right? Because it was such a dramatic change. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2684.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2688.12s)]
*  Right? And number two, so this is now a mental health issue rather than a we disagree politically [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2689.0s)]
*  issue, right? And so, but then that opens up, by the way, quick side note, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2696.6s)]
*  not get to the most important part. The side note is, this might also explain Dick Cheney. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2701.48s)]
*  People had that theory about Dick Cheney that he had the stroke and that he became a lot more [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2707.7200000000003s)]
*  conspiratorial and paranoid and he used to carry around a hazmat suit and his trunk in the car. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2711.7200000000003s)]
*  I didn't know any of this. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2717.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he had the 1% doctrine, which is if there's a 1% chance any Muslim's [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2718.12s)]
*  gonna attack us, we should destroy their country, right? And here's Fetterman, right? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2725.48s)]
*  So now that makes me super worried about strokes. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2731.72s)]
*  So- Don't go hunting with him. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2735.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Don't go hunting with Fetterman now. So, okay, now the most important point, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2736.84s)]
*  he's gotta go. We already had Dianne Feinstein and we already had Joe Biden. No, this isn't right. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2742.52s)]
*  This isn't right. He's not in the right state of mind. And I know how devastating that is. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2750.52s)]
*  Because it's Pennsylvania and if he really goes, we're gonna have to have an election. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2755.1600000000003s)]
*  And that's a toss up. That's a purple state, right? And I know how bad that is for Democrats. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2759.7200000000003s)]
*  But as Yaz said earlier, we have to have principles. If there was a Republican president [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2764.52s)]
*  who was clearly not mentally well, we would ask for an election, right? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2770.28s)]
*  I am. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2774.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. That would describe a lot of them. Okay, but seriously in this case, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2775.4s)]
*  this is not acceptable and he's gotta get actual help. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2780.84s)]
*  Great. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2783.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes, what do you think? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2784.44s)]
*  Yeah, and as far as this country is concerned, which is really why we're talking about this, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2785.8s)]
*  is because this is one of our sitting senators. As far as this is relevant to all of us, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2790.36s)]
*  I wonder what Fetterman's plan or strategy is going forward. If he is even going to [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2795.2400000000002s)]
*  attempt to run again for his seat and whenever that time comes. Or is he planning on switching [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2800.52s)]
*  parties? Is he planning to leave politics altogether perhaps for his health? Whether [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2805.88s)]
*  I mean at this point, I don't think he should be. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2811.0s)]
*  I don't wanna say he shouldn't be allowed to run, but somebody should step in and be like [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2813.4s)]
*  you shouldn't run. Like somebody close to him and the people close to him seem to be [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2816.6000000000004s)]
*  worried about his physical and mental health. Either way, I can't believe that the people who [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2820.92s)]
*  voted for him initially are going to vote for him again. And I feel like I could have said that [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2825.56s)]
*  before this story came out. This has been months now of this type of behavior, but now we're getting [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2829.7200000000003s)]
*  more insights into just how bad it actually is. And to John, to your earlier point, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2835.72s)]
*  this does feel very Trumpian. A lot of what he was saying felt very Trumpian. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2842.52s)]
*  He's using a lot of the same rhetoric, the same conspiratorial, paranoid thinking. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2846.6s)]
*  That is exactly what stood out to me as you were presenting the story. And I'm not trying to make [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2850.7599999999998s)]
*  any diagnoses for either of them, but regardless of what is causing this kind of behavior in our [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2856.04s)]
*  leaders, this is dangerous and unhinged behavior. And people suffering from these type of issues [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2860.76s)]
*  should not be in charge of anything or anyone, especially in such high levels of government. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2865.8s)]
*  And I already have my feelings about social media and about the doom scrolling. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2871.0s)]
*  I don't do it anymore. I quit, I'm very much off of social media as much as I can be, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2875.5600000000004s)]
*  still doing a job like this. But it does kind of skew your sense of reality. It sucks up a lot [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2881.88s)]
*  of your time. And frankly, I'm not comfortable knowing that our nation's leaders are spending [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2887.08s)]
*  a lot of their days like this on social media. And this isn't a recent take for me. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2891.24s)]
*  I have always found it concerning since for years now that Trump was on social media as much as he [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2896.6s)]
*  is and was. And I do think it's weird even that Elon Musk tweets as much as he does, even though [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2901.7999999999997s)]
*  it is his own platform. So I do think that it is a problem, not only that American voters seem a [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2906.92s)]
*  little bit detached from reality. I say a little bit to be generous, but also that our elected [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2912.44s)]
*  leaders are not doing much better in that way. So a lot of issues going on, but really, we have [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2917.32s)]
*  to work harder to get better people in these government positions, people who are just a [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2925.4s)]
*  little bit more mentally acute than maybe the rest of us. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2929.64s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I mean, when Elon took over Twitter, I started to back off a little bit after, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2947.56s)]
*  and many people know for years I used it constantly. And then when I had my daughter, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2958.44s)]
*  those two things just meant that I kind of couldn't use it for like a year. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2962.6s)]
*  And thank God, haven't missed anything, literally haven't missed anything. I mean, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2966.04s)]
*  I'm glad that I have communities. I can talk to TDR fans and TYT fans and everything, but [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2970.2s)]
*  it is better. So I'll make that three for three on the panel. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2974.52s)]
*  And yeah, is it any surprise that we're ruled by these people that spend every waking second [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2978.04s)]
*  typing out insane conspiratorial screeds online. And all of them have such obvious psychological [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2985.96s)]
*  and emotional failings, and they're the ones that have power over our lives, over our economic [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2991.7999999999997s)]
*  destinies. Something should be done. But unfortunately, they're also conspiracists. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=2997.08s)]
*  So if you go to Federman and you're like, hey, maybe you should back off and focus on your health. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3001.24s)]
*  He will probably think you're part of the machine trying to take him down rather than [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3006.2s)]
*  somebody exercising empathy. Yeah, so one of our members on tyt.com made a good point. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3009.9599999999996s)]
*  And Wang-Jong said, I wonder if this is why Federman was so defensive when people wanted [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3015.4799999999996s)]
*  Biden to drop out because of his mental decline. I think that might have been personal. I think [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3018.6s)]
*  that's an excellent point, and I think that's very likely to be true. And look, guys, so [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3023.3999999999996s)]
*  to first of all, if Federman doesn't wanna go, well, he's not mentally well. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3028.6800000000003s)]
*  That's why he doesn't wanna go, right? And to John's point, he'll think it's conspiracy, etc. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3034.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's process for these things. I mean, if you gotta impeach, you have to impeach. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3041.48s)]
*  He walked into traffic, had no idea that he'd got into traffic. He nearly picked a fight with [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3046.92s)]
*  a random group of people because he just bumped into them because he doesn't know where he's going. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3051.7200000000003s)]
*  He's not well. We cannot have a senator that is not in the right state of mind. So it's not close. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3056.52s)]
*  He's gotta go. And then finally, if you want the opposite of doom scrolling, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3064.28s)]
*  look, I sense the doom and gloom in the country. And we started this a long time ago. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3069.48s)]
*  We do things called Operation Hope and Operation Joy on the Young Turks. I know it's weird for a [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3076.36s)]
*  news show to do it, but it's because we've gotta have a little bit of lightness in this world. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3081.1600000000003s)]
*  As we fight back and as we're productive and try to do positive change in the world, right? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3085.4s)]

*  Yeah. All right, I know we're super short on time. Can we squeeze in the next story, do you think? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3118.04s)]
*  There are a lot of videos. Four videos, okay, we can't do it. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3123.08s)]
*  We can talk about the things he said about Palestinians. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3127.7999999999997s)]
*  Interesting. Just as one last little- [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3131.64s)]
*  Hi, let's do a quick- Tasty tidbit of awfulness. So you will not be surprised to find out that on [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3133.16s)]
*  the topic of Palestinians in Gaza, Fetterman's just the worst. He's really, really bad. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3138.52s)]
*  That's in public. In private, maybe even worse, because he apparently back in early February, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3145.0s)]
*  he met with the leader of the progressive Jewish organization, J Street. And he told [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3150.84s)]
*  Jeremy Ben-Ami, you can't reform a carton of sour milk, referring to the Palestinians. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3154.44s)]
*  And generally referring to a group of people, particularly one as oppressed as the Palestinians, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3161.72s)]
*  as food isn't good. But particularly when you're describing as rotten food that you would throw [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3167.0s)]
*  away. He apparently said he didn't believe in a two-state solution. Again, nobody's surprised to [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3171.7200000000003s)]
*  see that. Claimed he had never met an Arab person who would condemn Hamas. Notes from the meeting [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3176.6s)]
*  said, correction, only a single Arab he has met with that staff was present for wouldn't outright [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3183.0s)]
*  condemn Hamas. But he took it as one person he met wouldn't do so. And in his mind, it became [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3189.2400000000002s)]
*  there's not a single one who will condemn them. That's not good. He apparently in opposing a [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3196.04s)]
*  ceasefire said, quote, let's get back to killing. A person who heard the conversation told the [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3202.2s)]
*  journalist, he said, kill them all. Sounding similar to the allegations made against Pete [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3208.68s)]
*  Hegseth, saying at one point at a party supposedly that he wants to kill all Muslims. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3214.2s)]
*  Now he denied that account, saying he was referring only to Hamas. But we'll also say, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3219.24s)]
*  this is one of the most uncomfortable parts of this entire story. And bear in mind, she [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3223.8s)]
*  disputes parts of this. But according to multiple sources, his support for Israel, his opposition [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3227.32s)]
*  to the Palestinians apparently upset not only his staffers, but his wife Giselle as well. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3234.28s)]
*  Apparently in early November 2023, she arrived at his Senate office and they got into a heated [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3239.88s)]
*  argument. Staff recalled her saying with tears in her eyes, they are bombing refugee camps. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3244.92s)]
*  How can you support this? And he said, that's all propaganda. When it has happened many, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3249.96s)]
*  many times and is very much not propaganda. One former staffer recalled overhearing her on [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3256.04s)]
*  speakerphone that December saying to Federman, who did I marry? Where is the man I married? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3261.64s)]
*  And bear in mind, as we said, she disputes some of this saying that Gentleson, the former chief [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3266.36s)]
*  of staff who left and has been revealing a lot of this, is part of a conspiracy to damage her [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3271.8s)]
*  husband's reputation. Which fine, again, he's not the only source for this reporting. And look, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3276.36s)]
*  talking about anyone's marriage is really uncomfortable, but that is what the staffers [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3281.32s)]
*  say they were there to witness. What's also disturbing is that this person who's not mentally [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3284.92s)]
*  well has the same position as the Prime Minister of Israel. And the great majority of Congress votes [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3290.6800000000003s)]
*  the same exact way on that issue as a person who's literally mentally ill. Yeah. What does that make [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3298.6800000000003s)]
*  the rest of Congress? Yeah, his last word. Yeah, I was gonna say whenever you read about these very [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3305.8s)]
*  unhinged rulers, their history and all these terrible things that they enacted and the reasons [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3311.1600000000003s)]
*  behind why they enacted these things. It really shows you just how fickle are all of our lives [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3315.88s)]
*  are, right? You can get one person who ascends to a certain position of power in a country or wherever, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3322.04s)]
*  and then they get unwell or they start to become a little bit paranoid for whatever reason again. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3328.1200000000003s)]
*  But then all of those, their psychosis, let's say for lack of a better word, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3332.92s)]
*  is felt by the people, right? Because then they start implementing all these ideas. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3339.2400000000002s)]
*  And I mean, even there have been coups in entire countries just to bring it to more recent history [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3343.48s)]
*  where somebody was paranoid that there was communists down there. And so the CIA did a coup, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3349.0s)]
*  right? But these are things that we know about that happen. So it is just a thing that is a reality of [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3353.64s)]
*  this life and this world that we live in is that if you have an unhinged ruler, which a lot of times [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3360.36s)]
*  you will because these are the people who sought those high positions of power. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3365.8s)]
*  And those are people who wanted to have that much authority and control over people. And a lot of [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3370.2000000000003s)]
*  times there are some good leaders too. But just generally speaking, you're gonna get some of that. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3375.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's why it's so important in this country to have actual checks and balances to make sure [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3381.4s)]
*  that nobody gets too oversteppy in the things that they're trying to implement and execute upon [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3386.6s)]
*  an entire populace and sometimes upon the entire globe. Right now our checks and balances are a [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3392.52s)]
*  little off balance. So hopefully we can get that back on track somehow eventually. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3397.64s)]
*  But it is gonna take a while. And in the meantime, we're all gonna have to endure some weirdness. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3402.2799999999997s)]
*  Yep. All right, guys, check out Yaz on Rebel HQ. Check out John on Damage Report. We're gonna [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3407.4s)]
*  take a quick break. When we come back, Trump, I mean, he's stunning. You're gonna see the video [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3412.36s)]
*  if you haven't already. He literally doesn't know what the Declaration of Independence is. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3419.7200000000003s)]
*  It is unreal. Don't miss it. We'll be right back. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3424.6s)]
*  you [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgLzn6HhmUw&t=3436.92s)]
