"The Supreme Court on Thursday said innocent victims of wrong-house raids and other abuses by federal law enforcement can seek compensation for emotional and physical harms, upholding a key exception to sweeping legal immunity that has long protected the government from being sued.
The Court's decision resuscitates a lawsuit brought by Trina Martin and Toi Cliatt whose Atlanta home was mistakenly raided by the FBI in 2017, traumatizing Martin's then 7-year-old son and incurring $5000 of damage from burned carpet, broken doors, and fractured railings."

# SCOTUS Makes Long-Awaited Ruling On Wrong-House Raids
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ)
*  In 2017, Trina Martin, her son Gabe, who was seven at the time, and her partner, Toy Cleat, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  had that sense of security shattered by a flash bomb grenade that signaled the start [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  of an FBI raid. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=12.06s)]
*  It was like two guns put in my face at like one time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=13.8s)]
*  So I was just really just nervous. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=16.6s)]
*  That was my main focus, like I didn't wanna get killed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=18.84s)]
*  My safety came first at that moment. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  I remember being on the floor and I'm looking up to see what's going on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=24.64s)]
*  I see a bunch of automatic weapons pointed at me and I'm like, man. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=30.04s)]
*  Every year there are literally hundreds of cases involving raids on homes that were [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=37.36s)]
*  mistaken to be the homes that were meant to be targeted in said raids. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=43.28s)]
*  They're called wrong home or wrong house raids. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=49.0s)]
*  And the United States Supreme Court has now ruled in favor of a family, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=52.32s)]
*  the very family you just heard from, who is seeking to sue the federal government [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=56.64s)]
*  over a wrong house raid that had been carried out by the FBI back in 2017. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=62.08s)]
*  Now, who would have thought that the biggest blow to federal law enforcement [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=68.12s)]
*  immunity would come from a conservative Supreme Court in a unanimous decision? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=74.08s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=80.44s)]
*  This was one of the most shocking decisions I've seen in the Supreme Court. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=81.92s)]
*  So at the center of this case was Trina Martin and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=84.88s)]
*  her then boyfriend, Toy Client. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=88.28s)]
*  You just heard from him in that video. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=91.76s)]
*  Now Martin's home in Atlanta was wrongfully raided by the FBI back in 2017. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=93.8s)]
*  And it turns out that it was actually Martin's neighbor who was suspected of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=99.04s)]
*  engaging in gang activity and that was supposed to be the FBI's target. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=104.04s)]
*  Now, Martin's son who you also saw in that video was just seven years old at [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=108.56s)]
*  the time, and he had the pleasure of witnessing federal agents pointing guns [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=113.6s)]
*  at his own mother when he was just seven years old and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=119.16s)]
*  that's after busting into the house. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=122.52s)]
*  Now, obviously that's traumatizing for a child. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=125.72s)]
*  This family was victimized and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=129.16s)]
*  these victims incurred damages to their home as a result of the raid. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=130.88s)]
*  At the time they claimed $5,000 in damages due to a burnt carpet, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=135.28s)]
*  broken doors and fractured railings. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=139.88s)]
*  Agents quickly acknowledged by the way that they had stormed the wrong address due [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  to a faulty GPS direction, but the FBI refused to provide any restitution. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Lower courts later tossed out the family's liability claims, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=155.8s)]
*  citing sweeping protections under federal law. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=159.44s)]
*  Now when law enforcement, in this case the FBI, has broad immunity, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=162.4s)]
*  don't you think that maybe that doesn't incentivize them to be extra [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  cautious to ensure that they've got the right house when they do these raids? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=173.12s)]
*  When you know you have that immunity, you're just not going to be as cautious, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=179.96s)]
*  and I think that's what's happening here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=184.28000000000003s)]
*  Plus, these victims deserve restitution, and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=186.56s)]
*  the fact that the FBI wasn't even willing to pay them $5,000 is insanely gross, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=190.11999999999998s)]
*  but that's what we're dealing with here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=195.04s)]
*  So two lower courts actually tossed out Martin's lawsuit, but [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=197.44s)]
*  she took it all the way to the Supreme Court, and that brings us to today. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=201.44s)]
*  So in a unanimous decision, the high court said the Martin case could move forward, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=206.32s)]
*  but they did stop short of rendering judgment on whether the FBI could [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=212.32s)]
*  successfully invoke other legal defenses related to the discretionary nature of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=216.44s)]
*  its job. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  So Neil Gorsuch, who is very much a conservative Supreme Court justice, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=224.08s)]
*  wrote the deciding opinion. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=228.96s)]
*  I want to just read a quick excerpt from what he wrote. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=232.36s)]
*  He says, if federal officers raid the wrong house, causing property damage and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=234.44s)]
*  assaulting innocent occupants, may the homeowners sue the government for damages? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  The answer is not as obvious as it might be. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=246.28s)]
*  So the argument here is, well, look, you want to provide federal agents or [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  law enforcement enough immunity so they're able to do their job without fear of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=256.08s)]
*  a lawsuit. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=261.76s)]
*  But in writing his decision, Gorsuch also made clear that this lawsuit absolutely [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=263.36s)]
*  should move forward, given the recklessness that was demonstrated by the FBI. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=268.32s)]
*  I mean, just the unwillingness to double check to ensure that they had the right [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=274.68s)]
*  house. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=278.76s)]
*  Gorsuch confirmed that Congress has unambiguously opened the door to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=279.8s)]
*  potential liability when an officer commits an assault, battery, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=284.44s)]
*  false imprisonment, false arrest, or abuse of process. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=289.28s)]
*  He remanded the case to a lower court for [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=293.56s)]
*  further consideration as to whether the FBI could invoke other protections. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=297.4s)]
*  So this case isn't over yet. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=304.12s)]
*  It's not a full blown victory for Martin and her former boyfriend and her son. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=305.68s)]
*  However, what this does do is set precedent for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=312.12s)]
*  lawsuits against law enforcement, in this case, federal law enforcement, the FBI. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=316.0s)]
*  And that is a good precedent to set. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=322.36s)]
*  This is a big deal. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=324.2s)]
*  And so it chips away at law enforcement immunity. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, there needs to be a balance to ensure that it doesn't impede law [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=329.36s)]
*  enforcement's ability to do their jobs. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=333.64s)]
*  But clearly, the immunity is too broad and protects really bad behavior that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=335.28s)]
*  victimizes all sorts of innocent people across this country on a regular basis. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  Now, the Trump administration, by the way, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=345.28s)]
*  had argued that the Martin case should be thrown out. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  So that's what the Trump administration believed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=351.4s)]
*  But luckily, the Supreme Court disagreed with that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=354.28s)]
*  They claim that officers should be able to exercise discretion in the course of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=357.68s)]
*  their duties without worrying about lawsuits. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  I disagree, I'm glad the Supreme Court disagrees. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=364.72s)]
*  ABC News also reports that the Trump Justice Department has put a freeze [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=367.36s)]
*  on federal civil rights investigations into cops and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=372.12s)]
*  canceled consent decrees with police departments, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=375.76s)]
*  local police departments that were found. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=379.16s)]
*  There was evidence that they had engaged in a pattern of misconduct. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=381.8s)]
*  And in a concurring opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  joined by Justice Kataji Brown Jackson to liberal Supreme Court justices, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  of course, urged the lower court in the Martin case to be critical of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  the administration's assertions of immunity for [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=399.68s)]
*  officers discretionary actions in the line of duty. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=402.2s)]
*  So this is a super fascinating case. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=405.44s)]
*  I'm happy with the way the Supreme Court ruled in this case. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  We'll see how it plays out as it's sent back to the lower courts. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=413.72s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zlGejyRTQ&t=416.84000000000003s)]
