The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# WATCH: Karl Rove Accuses Americans Of Being Lazy
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs)
*  Now we have sort of the new thing is if you're a populist, you've got to now turn that around [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=0.0s)]
*  and all those people are victims. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=5.76s)]
*  They're victims of corporations who have somehow ravaged their lives. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=7.28s)]
*  And we've got to take care of them by giving them everything free. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=11.64s)]
*  Forget it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  That's not what those people want. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=15.42s)]
*  And it's not what God decided that he wants them to be. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=16.76s)]
*  It's what they have decided themselves that they want to be. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=19.76s)]
*  We need to work as a country on re-igniting a culture of personal responsibility. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Former Bush White House aide Karl Rove joined the Wall Street Journal's All Things with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=28.8s)]
*  Kim Strasselle podcast this week to essentially accuse Americans of being lazy and attack [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=33.96s)]
*  what he called the populists inside the Republican Party for giving those people what they want. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=39.68s)]
*  But before we hear more from Rove, Cenk, initial thoughts at Karl Rove's attacks on populists. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, when you're on the moral high ground, even your opponent makes [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=51.76s)]
*  your points for you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=59.24s)]
*  So the more Karl Rove talks, the more populism goes up in popularity. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=61.04s)]
*  Okay, so we're going to give you more of that in a second. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=65.2s)]
*  So by the way, here is yet another fight between the Republicans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=68.82s)]
*  I was told that there wouldn't be any fights between the Republicans. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=75.36s)]
*  They were a cult and would never ever disagree with one another. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=77.64s)]
*  Is anyone still holding onto that? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=81.88s)]
*  Okay, if you are, let it go, let it go. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=83.88s)]
*  So who's right in this fight? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=88.0s)]
*  Well, we're going to discuss that after Jordan gives us more of the facts. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=89.68s)]
*  So it started when Kim Strasselle asked Rove about Republicans like Josh Hawley, who have [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=94.08s)]
*  spoken out against programs or cuts to programs like Medicaid. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=99.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  What's your make of this argument that some in the Republican Party have that given that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=104.74s)]
*  they're looking for new voters and that the Republicans have become more of a working [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  class party, you can't afford to touch any of these entitlements anymore. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=113.1s)]
*  It irritated the heck out of me. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=117.06s)]
*  When the Biden White House said, we're going to take a power that we do not have, the ability [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  to wipe out the assets that are held by the American people in the form of the student [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=123.94s)]
*  loans that we're supposed to get repaid, our government is supposed to get repaid on. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=129.84s)]
*  We're going to wipe those out because we're worried about getting votes from the young [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  voters. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=137.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=138.54s)]
*  And so, bread and circuses, is this Rome again? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=139.54s)]
*  Do we have this Caesar trying to appease the populace by giving them bread and circuses? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=141.82s)]
*  And Bernie Sanders says this, we can't take anybody who's on any one of these programs [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=146.66s)]
*  and toss them off, even if they are illegal aliens or even if they are able bodied or [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  even if they are on there because of fraud. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=156.02s)]
*  Josh Hawley, please. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=158.66s)]
*  Ben Roeve made a reference to JD Vance's book to claim that Americans have become too dependent [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=161.1s)]
*  on handouts. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  Now, I read a book once, it was called Hillbilly Elegy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  And it said that the Appalachian reasons and great parts of the Midwest had suffered because [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=172.38s)]
*  of the decline of the culture of personal responsibility and an understanding that work [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=177.34s)]
*  is liberating and work rises you up. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=181.74s)]
*  Instead, people had fallen into a dependency on government. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  Now we have sort of the new thing is, if you're a populist, you've got to now turn that around [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=188.78s)]
*  and all those people are victims, they're victims of corporations who have somehow ravaged [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=193.1s)]
*  their lives. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=197.98s)]
*  And we've got to take care of them by giving them everything free. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=198.98s)]
*  Forget it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=201.58s)]
*  We as a country are going to be compassionate to those who need our help. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=202.58s)]
*  But if you're able bodied, by God, you got to take care of yourself and we'll help you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=205.82s)]
*  But we're not going to give you lots of free things. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=210.02s)]
*  Now that is a curious accusation coming from someone who has consistently pushed for handouts [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=212.06s)]
*  for corporations and the wealthiest Americans. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=217.26s)]
*  In 2017, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, he hilariously defended that position by claiming [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=220.02s)]
*  that corporate taxes are paid mostly by workers in the form of lower wages and smaller benefits. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=227.06s)]
*  Some of the tax is passed on to consumers as higher prices. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=233.74s)]
*  Cutting the corporate tax rate will raise wages. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=237.46s)]
*  In the same piece, he wrote that the popular items, middle class tax cuts, a bigger child [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=240.54s)]
*  tax credit, an increased standard deduction, tend not to add as much growth. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  The provisions that juice the economy are the more arcane items, like lowering corporate [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=254.7s)]
*  tax rates and ending double taxation of American companies' foreign profits. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=260.42s)]
*  And as for his accusation that Americans have become too lazy and aren't working as hard [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  as they used to, the data shows that worker productivity has skyrocketed while wages have [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=273.58000000000004s)]
*  plateaued. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  You can see that here, productivity continuing to increase, hourly compensation barely in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  uptick since 1980. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=286.62s)]
*  Cenk, how serious are we treating Karl Rove's comments here? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=289.06s)]
*  Yeah, no, I love it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=294.38s)]
*  I think it's really important, not because Karl Rove is right, of course, he's comically [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=295.97999999999996s)]
*  wrong, but because of the rift within the Republican Party. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=299.5s)]
*  And that could have really wide policy ramifications. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=303.26s)]
*  But we're gonna find out if Josh Hawley's full of crap really soon. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=307.7s)]
*  And that's gonna be based on his vote on this budget bill that's coming up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=311.2s)]
*  But first, that chart that you just showed, that's in my book, Justice is Coming. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  And the trend actually starts in 1978. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=321.74s)]
*  And that's when the Supreme Court started allowing corporations to give endless money [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=324.74s)]
*  to politicians. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  And so that's why they captured our government right from the beginning, Citizens United [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=331.9s)]
*  shot a dead horse. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=336.34s)]
*  And they started taking all of the profits for themselves and not sharing it with American [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  people. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=342.34s)]
*  As you saw, wages were going up for 40 straight years along with productivity. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=343.34s)]
*  It's not a natural thing in the market that our wages are not supposed to go up. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=349.12s)]
*  They are supposed to go up, but they captured the government under corporate rule. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=353.96s)]
*  And that is why they haven't gone up. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  So that's why when Karl Rove says, no, no, no, you just give all sorts of free goodies [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=361.64s)]
*  to giant corporations who conveniently happen to be our donors. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=367.4s)]
*  And then they'll eventually share it with you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=371.9s)]
*  No, the evidence shows they will not share it with you at all. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  They'll take it home into their mansions, their yachts, etc. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=377.32s)]
*  And the very, very, very last thing they'll do is share it with their employees. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=380.4s)]
*  Because it's such a dumb, dumb thing, unless you're lying, which Karl Rove, of course, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=384.24s)]
*  is lying. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  But if you don't realize it, corporations don't voluntarily go, you know what? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  We're making so much money, even though we could give more to ourselves and to our shareholders, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=396.0s)]
*  we'll voluntarily give more to our workers. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=400.88s)]
*  That's not a thing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=404.32s)]
*  You need to create leverage for the workers, unions are the best way to do that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=405.42s)]
*  But there's many other ways to do that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=408.7s)]
*  And it's getting our democracies the number back is the number one way to do that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=411.3s)]
*  So the idea that he's against giving out something free to corporations is empirically incorrect. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=416.16s)]
*  They have not only given tax cuts, I mean, trillions of dollars in taxes, they have also [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=421.62s)]
*  given endless subsidies to corporations. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  Do you know that the oil and gas companies still get 30 billion a year in subsidies? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=429.3s)]
*  That's all of us, the average guy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=437.18s)]
*  You know how we complain about why is Israel taking money from the average American and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=438.66s)]
*  using it when they're top 20 country economically, and then using it to kill people, etc. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=442.62s)]
*  But that's also true of so many other places. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=448.66s)]
*  In fact, with Exxon Mobil and the oil companies, they're taking even more than Israel most [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=450.94s)]
*  of the years. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=457.26s)]
*  They've been taking it for about 100 years straight, and it started very small in the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=458.86s)]
*  beginning and then once money in politics got in, it got rocket boost in there. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=463.26s)]
*  They've been robbing us for decade after decade after decade. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=469.3s)]
*  And it's guys like Karl Rove that allowed that robbery to happen. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=473.0s)]
*  But the minute you give it to the average guy, he's like, yeah, you want free stuff? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=476.2s)]
*  No way, man, what is this populism? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  But notice how nervous he is about populism, how scared he is of populism. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=482.02s)]
*  Josh Hawley and other Republicans go towards populism, serving the average guy instead [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=488.65999999999997s)]
*  of corporate donors. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=492.74s)]
*  Don't do it, don't do it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=493.97999999999996s)]
*  So Karl Rove is 200% wrong here. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=496.97999999999996s)]
*  He's exactly what's wrong with the establishment, the Uniparty, and the guys who work for corporate [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=500.14s)]
*  donors. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=504.86s)]
*  That ideology is a cancer in Washington, and that cancer has been around for a long, long [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=506.34s)]
*  time. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=513.18s)]
*  So that part we've known and fought against for the entirety of the Young Turks. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=514.18s)]
*  Now the part that's really interesting as to how things are going to develop is, yes, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=518.9399999999999s)]
*  Josh Hawley, but are you just trying to score political points? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=524.26s)]
*  And hey, guys, look, I've got Pete Buttigieg in his new flannel shirt. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=526.8599999999999s)]
*  Hawley's new flannel shirt is, I'm going to pretend to save Medicaid and Medicare, but [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=533.42s)]
*  I won't, and I'll vote for the tax cuts anyway. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=537.8199999999999s)]
*  Yay, donors. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=540.8599999999999s)]
*  Well, we're going to find out, Hawley. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=542.34s)]
*  We're going to find out if you're enormously full of crap and you're just a warmed over [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=544.22s)]
*  Karl Rove, or if you actually mean it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=548.26s)]
*  Jackson, what do you think? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=551.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, the idea that Americans are lazy is ridiculous, because at the end of the day, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=552.86s)]
*  most people work hard enough at least to survive. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=557.5s)]
*  And in the modern economy, people are working two, three jobs, having all types of side [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=560.26s)]
*  hustles. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=564.66s)]
*  We're living more in a gig economy to where people have to pay out of pocket for things [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=567.02s)]
*  like health insurance. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=570.66s)]
*  And speaking of Trump's big, beautiful bill that the CBO just estimated would have, what, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=572.3399999999999s)]
*  11 million plus people lose their health insurance. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=577.98s)]
*  Other estimations have shown 13.7 million people lose their health insurance. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=581.02s)]
*  And then of course, people like Rand Paul, they're like, no, I'm not with this bill because [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=586.42s)]
*  of the deficit. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=590.02s)]
*  But 14 million people, y'all can lose your healthcare. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=591.02s)]
*  I don't care about that, but the deficit, man. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=593.02s)]
*  But at the end of the day, American culture is very ambitious, very driven towards wealth [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=596.78s)]
*  and riches, and very individualistic. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=602.42s)]
*  So again, and even to collect things like, let's say, if you're not a senior citizen [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=604.8599999999999s)]
*  or if you're not very ill, to get things like Medicaid or welfare, you have to be broke. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=609.4799999999999s)]
*  Or you don't qualify for it, and most people just aren't gonna. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=616.4s)]
*  You know what? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=619.14s)]
*  I'd rather just not work at all. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=620.14s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=621.8599999999999s)]
*  But I think Elon Musk is really onto something when he says that the Republican Party's in [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=623.22s)]
*  trouble for 2026 and 28. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=627.94s)]
*  Because what are they without Donald Trump? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=630.42s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump's on his last leg at the end of the day. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=633.22s)]
*  He can't be president again, even if he tries, it's not gonna happen. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=636.14s)]
*  And the Republican Party just really has no identity without him, at this point at least. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=640.5s)]
*  And another issue that they have is Trump isn't delivering on any of his promises to [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=645.7s)]
*  make things cheaper. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=649.32s)]
*  So as he keeps ramping up terraces, he keeps destroying our alliances, as the rest of the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=650.34s)]
*  world continues to unite against us, as the US dollar continues to face threats of no [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=656.34s)]
*  longer being the reserve currency. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=661.62s)]
*  I mean, if people are losing access to benefits and they can't afford anything, a wet paper [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=663.9s)]
*  bag could be a Republican. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=669.98s)]
*  Now that doesn't mean that the Democrats, unfortunately, the Democrats likely will go [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=671.86s)]
*  forward in 2026 and 2028 with that mindset like, well, the Republicans suck so we can win. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=676.3000000000001s)]
*  Which is a lot of why they're in the position that they're in right now. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=682.3000000000001s)]
*  But the ultimate silver lining to me for the left is that we have really big opportunity [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=684.94s)]
*  to get great candidates in office from the federal government all the way down to the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=691.9s)]
*  state government. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  One, because people like Karl Rove, they're just on their way out. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=696.86s)]
*  And we're entering a time where it's, I mean, this populism really is a time that we live in. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=701.58s)]
*  So if Trump's not gonna deliver, then I think we have a good chance to get some good candidates [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=707.58s)]
*  in office. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=712.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think these Medicaid cuts are going to be disastrous like you're talking about, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=712.86s)]
*  Jackson. These numbers are massive and the work requirements, the shifts and they're [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=716.86s)]
*  trying to defend it. We have more from Rove, but I want people to understand the reality here. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=720.86s)]
*  They're trying to reconfigure these work requirements that it disproportionately impacts [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=725.82s)]
*  people who already are working. It's not that people who are ineligible are getting it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=729.9s)]
*  They're using this Reagan era welfare queen type language that isn't accurate. It is people who [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=734.22s)]
*  are already working. Health insurance is not provided by their hourly job. And then there's [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=740.06s)]
*  going to be an increased burden on top of that to keep their Medicaid. That is who is going to lose [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=746.22s)]
*  coverage. But conservatives like Karl Rove, they're gonna continue to go to bat for work [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=751.66s)]
*  requirements. And that's going to, like Jackson said, boot millions of people, a CBO estimate, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=756.54s)]
*  11 million people off of their Medicaid. And he's joined by people like CMS administrator, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=762.3s)]
*  Dr. Oz, who told Americans they could keep their health insurance by proving that they matter. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=767.66s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=772.6999999999999s)]
*  I have confidence in the American people. You give people a chance to work and we know we have [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=773.18s)]
*  twice as many jobs as there are people looking for them. Go out there, do entry-level jobs, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=777.42s)]
*  get into the workforce, prove that you matter, get agency into your own life. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=781.82s)]
*  It's a much more enjoyable experience if you're going through a life thinking it should control [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=785.74s)]
*  your destiny and you'll get better insurance at the same time. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=790.46s)]
*  And now we're learning that senators are eyeing cuts to Medicare also. Here's what Senator Kevin [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=793.2600000000001s)]
*  Kramer told reporters after a meeting with Senate Republicans on Wednesday. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=800.38s)]
*  There was a legitimate debate about, can we do more with Medicaid? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=804.54s)]
*  Are we doing too much with Medicaid? How much waste, fraud and abuses are in Medicare? Why [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=809.02s)]
*  don't we go after that? I think we should. Some people are afraid of the topics, I'm not. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=813.5s)]
*  I just think, in my view, this is our moment as Republicans in control of all three branches. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=819.98s)]
*  And we ought to be going after more fiscal responsibility. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=826.46s)]
*  Some people are making that case, other people are reeling their hands. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=830.46s)]
*  I mean, we're getting into Medicare now, Medicaid already bad enough. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=833.42s)]
*  Touching Medicare and Social Security, Cenk, that's the third rail in politics. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=837.9s)]
*  Is this going to blow up in their faces? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=840.94s)]
*  Yeah, if they do, I think it will. And I think that people are getting restless already [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=842.7s)]
*  on several fronts. But so look at what he said though, what he said is super interesting. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=848.62s)]
*  He said, as Republicans, this is our moment to be able to cut Medicare. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=853.1800000000001s)]
*  Remember, this is the party that promised you a thousand times, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=858.9399999999999s)]
*  like every time they get into office and they have power, they talk about cutting Social Security [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=861.9799999999999s)]
*  and Medicare. And then when they're running for office, they say, we're never gonna cut Social [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=866.4599999999999s)]
*  Security and Medicare, no way, no way. Democrats are being outraged. You remember when Biden said [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=869.9799999999999s)]
*  they were gonna do that in the State of the Union and they all booed him? The Republicans did like, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=874.6999999999999s)]
*  no, and he's like, okay, I'm glad you're on the record, he's not wanting to cut it. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=879.18s)]
*  And all of a sudden, here comes Senator Kramer. A Republican go, yeah, of course, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=882.38s)]
*  we're gonna cut Medicare. This is our moment to gut the average American, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=885.9s)]
*  all those senior citizens. They paid into it their whole lives like suckers. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=891.98s)]
*  Now we get to rob them and give it to our rich donors who are gonna get 3.6 trillion dollar tax [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=896.86s)]
*  cut overall. Yeah, that's your moment, all right. But I mean, see guys, that's what I'm scared about [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=903.5s)]
*  when they say, there's not enough cuts in this bill. We should hold this bill up because there [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=909.82s)]
*  are not enough cuts. And at the last second, they'd be like, well, okay, we reached a compromise. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=916.5400000000001s)]
*  Not only are we gutting Medicaid, but we're also gonna gut Medicare and give even more to the rich. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=920.38s)]
*  What a compromise. But by the way, none of that is about the budget, the deficit or the debt, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=925.82s)]
*  which they're gonna add trillions to. It's all about taking from the average American [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=931.5s)]
*  and giving it to their donors. That's what all of American politics is about. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=936.38s)]
*  That's why even as the Republicans are punching themselves in the face 200 times over, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=940.62s)]
*  the Democrats are pulling a 26%. Why? Cuz they're playing good cop, bad cop. And my whole life, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=945.5s)]
*  I'm so sick of this obvious soap opera. And I'm so sick of mainstream media not noticing it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=951.18s)]
*  They keep playing these games and at the end, what do they do? I've been covering it for over [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=959.82s)]
*  25 years. They do the same thing every single time. They take from you and they give to their [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=963.58s)]
*  donors 100 out of 100 times. Back to Medicaid for a second. So now you're telling us, well, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=970.22s)]
*  we need a work requirement because you have to prove that you matter. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=978.3000000000001s)]
*  But wait a minute, Medicaid isn't for the rich, it's for the poor. That's the whole point. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=981.98s)]
*  Medicare and social security are for senior citizens. If you have a job, etc., you usually [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=986.22s)]
*  get healthcare from there. You've got Obamacare, but Medicaid is for people who really can't afford [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=993.6600000000001s)]
*  it. And we don't want them to die. We don't want their kids to die cuz they don't have healthcare. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=999.34s)]
*  Now they're like, well, now you need a work requirement. And then once you have work, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1004.14s)]
*  then that's it. You make too much money for Medicaid. Well, that's ending Medicaid. Soon [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1007.98s)]
*  they'll come out and be like, no, Medicaid should be only for millionaires who approve that they are [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1012.78s)]
*  worth many millions of dollars. Then we'll give them Medicaid for the poor. That doesn't make any [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1017.1s)]
*  sense at all. They're not even trying to make sense. And to Jackson's point about populism's [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1023.3399999999999s)]
*  on the rise, and this is the moment. Guys, that's why we started Rebellion PAC. Go to [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1027.8999999999999s)]
*  rebellionpac.com. There's real Democratic left-wing populists that believe in giving to the average [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1032.78s)]
*  guy, not to the donor class. That exists, and I'm telling you that partly because [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1040.54s)]
*  mainstream media has a total blockade on it. There is actually an amazing left-wing populist [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1046.7s)]
*  option, but mainstream media is like, no, no, establishment on both sides. We'll talk about [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1052.3799999999999s)]
*  a 24-7. The fake populists on the right, we'll talk about a 24-7. You got something that might [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1056.86s)]
*  work? No, never, never, never mention it. Don't mention it, right? No, we've got three candidates [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1061.6599999999999s)]
*  and a lot more on the way, rebellionpac.com. Jackson, what do you think? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1067.42s)]
*  Well, just real quick, you remember, I think it maybe was a month ago or something when Howard [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1070.38s)]
*  Lutnick, who's the commerce secretary, he was on TV talking about how if people get their social [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1075.74s)]
*  security payments late, it's not that big of a deal. If my mom got it late, it wouldn't be that [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1082.54s)]
*  big of a deal, but your mom doesn't need it because you're massively wealthy. But that's really the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1086.94s)]
*  attitude that these people have. The way I see it, and it's not like I came up with this, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1091.26s)]
*  but it's just an attempt to subjugate the public, cut off all access to climb on the social ladder, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1097.42s)]
*  whether that be allowing more discrimination against the LGBTQ community. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1102.7s)]
*  The Supreme Court recently rolled back Roe v. Wade. They're continuously giving Donald Trump [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1107.66s)]
*  more executive authority to do much of whatever he likes. So the more that that happens, the more [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1111.82s)]
*  it's just gonna be massively difficult for people, not even to become rich, but to have enough money [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1117.66s)]
*  to maybe go on a couple vacations a year, take their family out to dinner once or twice a week. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1123.5800000000002s)]
*  Those are really the main things that people want. Most people aren't trying to be [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1128.46s)]
*  millionaire playboys. They just wanna have decent lives. But that's just been on the chopping block [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1132.8600000000001s)]
*  my entire life. And as you pointed out, go ahead and hit up RebellionPac as much as we can, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1138.5400000000002s)]
*  because now's really the time. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJTU6gAxuCs&t=1144.46s)]
