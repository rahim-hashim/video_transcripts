"Comedian Stephen Colbert had no shortage of material Tuesday night after President Donald Trump‚Äôs address to Congress that saw The Late Show host skewer the Democratic opposition‚Äôs protests.

During his marathon speech, Trump declared his administration was ‚Äújust getting started‚Äù as he touted his push to shrink the federal workforce, overhaul foreign policy, and escalate a high-stakes trade war. Meanwhile, as Trump spoke, Democratic lawmakers silently held up small placards reading ‚Äúlies‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse‚Äù in protest ‚Äì just one of several strategies deployed throughout the night."

# Democratic Protests To Trump Fall FLAT Except For One
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ)
*  Mr. Green, take your seat. Take your seat, sir. Take your seat. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Finding that members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper decorum, the chair now directs the sergeant-at-arms to restore order. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=9.0s)]
*  Remove this gentleman from the chamber. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=19.0s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Al Green from the state of Texas was removed from the House chamber last night as Donald Trump was presenting his joint address to Congress. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=30.0s)]
*  Now, in the very beginning of President Trump's speech, there was a lot of commotion in the crowd, in the audience. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=42.0s)]
*  And I suspected that it would be Democratic lawmakers who were taking issue with some of what Donald Trump was saying. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=50.0s)]
*  And that certainly was the case, especially when it came to Representative Al Green. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=57.0s)]
*  Now, what seemed to set him off was President Trump's declaration that he and the Republican Party essentially have a mandate after sweeping the swing states. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=62.0s)]
*  And mandate is a strong word. I think it's true to some extent that voters supported Trump over Kamala Harris on certain issues. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=73.0s)]
*  For instance, Donald Trump's immigration policies, as much as members of our audience might absolutely despise it, the American people seem to be messaging that they find Donald Trump's immigration policies to be more favorable. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=83.0s)]
*  But no voters or very few voters supported Trump to essentially dismantle our social safety net. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=96.0s)]
*  But that is what appears to be the case with what the Trump administration is doing in dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which of course protects Americans from big banks ripping them off. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=106.0s)]
*  The Doge team is also working to dismantle the Social Security Administration. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=119.0s)]
*  They have already put out notices to fire 7,000 workers. We covered that earlier this week. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=124.0s)]
*  I would venture to say that voters did not cast their ballots hoping that the Trump administration would do these things. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=131.0s)]
*  And so Congressman Al Green wanted to make that point. Here's more of what he had to say in the crowd. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=140.0s)]
*  I know it's hard to hear or see, but just follow the red arrow and you'll know what we're talking about. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=146.0s)]
*  USA, USA, USA, USA. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=151.0s)]
*  And one counties in our country, 2,700 to 525. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=156.0s)]
*  On a map that reads almost completely red for Republican. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=164.0s)]
*  Small business optimism, so it's single largest one month gain ever recorded. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=170.0s)]
*  Mr. President, one point jump. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=177.0s)]
*  Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House and to cease any further disruptions. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=185.0s)]
*  That's your warning. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=192.0s)]
*  Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of the quorum and the chair is prepared to direct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=193.0s)]
*  So again, I know it's difficult to hear what Congressman Green was saying there, but you can kind of hear him say there is no mandate. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=207.0s)]
*  And again, what he's specifically referring to are programs like Medicaid, Social Security. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=216.0s)]
*  In fact, after this whole debacle occurred, he spoke to reporters right outside the House chamber. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=222.0s)]
*  Let's hear more of what he had to say. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=228.0s)]
*  I've said I'll accept the punishment, but it's worth it to let people know that there are some of us who are going to stand up against this president's desire to cut Medicaid, Medicare, and the rest of the world. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=231.0s)]
*  He has no mandate to cut Medicaid. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=242.0s)]
*  None. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=251.0s)]
*  Is the only punishment that you were kicked out, sir? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=252.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=255.0s)]
*  Whatever the punishment is, I'm not fighting the punishment. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=256.0s)]
*  This is about the people who are being punished by virtue of losing their health care. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=259.0s)]
*  This is the richest country in the world, and we have people who don't have good health care. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=264.0s)]
*  We've got to do better. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=269.0s)]
*  And now we're about to cut Medicaid, which is for poor people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=270.0s)]
*  Health care has become wealth care for many people, and we can't afford to let that happen. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=273.0s)]
*  I like that line, health care has become welfare. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=280.0s)]
*  Wealth-fair, not welfare. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=283.0s)]
*  And look, his anger is righteous. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=285.0s)]
*  When he's referring to cuts to Medicaid, he's specifically talking about the fact that the House of Representatives just passed the framework for the federal budget. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=289.0s)]
*  And in that framework, the House committee responsible for services like Medicaid are essentially being told you need to find $880 billion in cuts. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=299.0s)]
*  The framework doesn't specifically use the word Medicaid because House Republicans think we're stupid and we're unable to put two and two together. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=312.0s)]
*  But when you go to the specific committee and you demand that they cut $880 billion, where do you think that money is going to come from? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=322.0s)]
*  So what Congressman Green is drawing attention to is an important issue. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=331.0s)]
*  There was substance to what he had to say. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=338.0s)]
*  Now, look, do I think that his protest during this speech is going to make all the difference? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=341.0s)]
*  I don't. We don't live in a world like that, okay? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=347.0s)]
*  You actually need to have a strategy and plan to fight back and you need to be persistent. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=350.0s)]
*  But this is a symbolic show of what Democrats like Congressman Green stand for. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=355.0s)]
*  And that's what I've been begging the Democratic Party to engage in. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=362.0s)]
*  What do you stand for? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=367.0s)]
*  What do you represent? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=369.0s)]
*  What do you want to do for the American people? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=370.0s)]
*  Because all we've seen from Democrats in recent election cycles is this obsession with their own power, their own political careers. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=372.0s)]
*  I mean, Congresswoman Slotkin's speech in response to Trump was pathetic. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=380.0s)]
*  Was that Reagan or was that a Democrat? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=389.0s)]
*  Like, what was that? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=392.0s)]
*  And I'm supposed to cheerlead for that party? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=394.0s)]
*  No, I'm sorry. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=397.0s)]
*  Republican light in terms of economic policies, in terms of austerity, that is not appealing to me at all, at all. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=399.0s)]
*  Now, again, the anger you see from Congressman Green is righteous, it's justified, and he's on message, the right message. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=407.0s)]
*  So, look, there were a lot of Republicans, including Republican voters, who were kind of trashing him for being disruptive. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=418.0s)]
*  And look, it's fair to argue that you should be respectful to the president, that you shouldn't interrupt the president as he's in the middle of giving his speech. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=428.0s)]
*  The thing is, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=437.0s)]
*  And what I'm specifically referring to is this. Let's take a look. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=441.0s)]
*  So if you have Republican Congresswomen interrupting a Democratic president's speech, well, you've now opened the Pandora's box. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=445.0s)]
*  And you have created an atmosphere that justifies all sorts of interruptions from anyone in Congress. Why not? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=454.0s)]
*  If you are unwilling to show respect to a president from the opposing party, you should expect the same treatment for a president in your party as he's giving a speech. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=462.0s)]
*  That's just the way the world works, guys. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=475.0s)]
*  I wish that wasn't the case. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=479.0s)]
*  I wish instead of engaging in theater, right, instead of focusing all of our energy on protests that don't really lead to anything, there was strategic thinking happening in Congress among the Democrats. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=481.0s)]
*  We don't really see much of that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=496.0s)]
*  We've heard stories about Hakeem Jeffries, the House Minority Leader fundraising from the same lobbying firms that represent the tech billionaires and tech companies that are in the middle of giving a speech. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=498.0s)]
*  And then there's also the tech companies that are now 100% on Donald Trump's side. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=510.0s)]
*  You know, the same lobbying firms that do lobbying on behalf of Palantir. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=515.0s)]
*  That's what Hakeem Jeffries has been up to. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=520.0s)]
*  So in that context, am I going to trash Congressman Green for having a righteous statement and engaging in a righteous action, in my view? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=523.0s)]
*  No, I'm not going to trash him for that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=535.0s)]
*  I'm not going to trash the other Democrats though, because they could have walked out in solidarity with Congressman Green. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=537.0s)]
*  They didn't do that. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=543.0s)]
*  They did other things. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=545.0s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=546.0s)]
*  So look, other Democratic members, according to NBC News, wore stickers accusing Elon Musk of stealing Social Security. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=549.0s)]
*  Musk, a billionaire whose government efficiency initiative is scrutinizing Social Security finances, has called the program a Ponzi scheme. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=560.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a huge threat to an incredibly popular social safety net program. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=568.0s)]
*  Elon Musk referring to it as a Ponzi scheme was the foreshadowing moment to what came next, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=574.0s)]
*  which was essentially the slow and steady dismantling of the Social Security Administration by laying off 7,000 Social Security Administration workers. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=579.0s)]
*  So they're not going to dismantle it through legislation. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=589.0s)]
*  They're just hoping that Americans are going to be asleep at the wheel and celebrate Doge for cutting waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=593.0s)]
*  But in reality, a lot of this attention has been focused on certain programs that actually help the most vulnerable Americans among us. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=601.0s)]
*  Taxpaying Americans who unfortunately are not paid a living wage and are unable to pay for their own health insurance. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=609.0s)]
*  They're living below the poverty line. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=618.0s)]
*  Americans who did their duty, played by the rules, paid into the Social Security system, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=621.0s)]
*  and are now likely going to be fleeced by what's going on with the Trump administration. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=628.0s)]
*  So your little stickers don't do jack, okay? They don't do anything. It's just so utterly pathetic. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=634.0s)]
*  Look, I would be fine with the stickers. I would. If there was something more robust happening with the Democratic caucus behind the scenes, but there is nothing happening. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=642.0s)]
*  That's the problem here. There's more. Let's go to the next graphic. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=652.0s)]
*  So in this photo, you'll notice Democratic lawmakers holding paddles, ping pong paddles with various statements on it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=657.0s)]
*  False, probably responding to some of Donald Trump's statements saying that they're not correct, not rooted in reality. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=665.0s)]
*  Others have paddles that say Musk steals. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=672.0s)]
*  Now the paddle protest led to a lot of mockery, including from Stephen Colbert of The Late Show. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=677.0s)]
*  Of course, Stephen Colbert is no fan of Donald Trump, so you can't accuse him of being a Republican supporter who just wants to trash Democrats. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=683.0s)]
*  He says Trump barked out one appalling claim after another. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=690.0s)]
*  But don't you worry, Democrats are getting ready to fight back with their little paddles. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=695.0s)]
*  That is how you save democracy by quietly dissenting or bidding on an antique tea set. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=700.0s)]
*  It was hard to tell what was going on. And Colbert also decided to unveil his own message on a paddle. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=706.0s)]
*  Try doing something. And he wasn't the only one. Simone Sanders Townsend, you can't accuse her of being a Republican who's just trashing Democrats, but she was critical of what the Democrats were up to. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=715.0s)]
*  By the way, I should note, Stephen Colbert also said that he had no problem with what Congressman Green did, probably because there was actually substance to his message. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=727.0s)]
*  He did something that led to him literally getting ushered out of the House chamber. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=739.0s)]
*  And the message was a powerful one, an important one. Musk steals, okay, I mean, that's really, what is that going to do? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=744.0s)]
*  Okay, so Simone Sanders Townsend, top campaign advisor for Biden, top campaign advisor for Harris. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=753.0s)]
*  She was the head honcho for the Bernie campaign in 2016. She wasn't impressed by the paddles either. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=762.0s)]
*  She says, why are Democrats just sitting there? The signs are not landing. It is giving bingo, sigh. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=769.0s)]
*  And she followed that up with B42, b42 bingo. They are not taking back the House with these visuals. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=776.0s)]
*  And look, I think she's right. Members of the Democratic Women's Caucus, they decided to wear matching outfits. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=786.0s)]
*  They wore pink to protest Trump's anti-abortion policies. Again, I just want to reiterate and emphasize, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=793.0s)]
*  I typically wouldn't really have much of an issue without any of this. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=800.0s)]
*  But I think the reason why people like me, people like Simone Sanders Townsend, people like Stephen Colbert do have a problem with it, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=804.0s)]
*  is because it's just, it's all like this weak pathetic facade. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=813.0s)]
*  They think they're giving us this feeling that they're really fighting for us. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=820.0s)]
*  When in reality, we know what's going on behind the scenes. We know that they're not really planning anything. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=826.0s)]
*  They're not strategizing. They don't even have a coherent message. What do they stand for? What do Democrats represent? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=831.0s)]
*  Why aren't they constantly going after the Trump administration for dismantling the Social Security Administration? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=840.0s)]
*  That is such an incredibly popular program. We should be in the type of environment right now where we get sick of hearing Democrats talk about it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=848.0s)]
*  I mean, if I were a Democratic Congresswoman right now or a senator, I would be going to red states, red cities, red towns. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=857.0s)]
*  I would be reaching out to Republican voters, not from a place of anger, not from a place of judgment, but from a place of, first of all, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=867.0s)]
*  trying to understand them and where they're coming from. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=875.0s)]
*  But also letting them know what the reality is with Doge and what Musk is doing to the very programs that they themselves favor. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=878.0s)]
*  Republican voters do not want to get rid of Social Security. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=888.0s)]
*  But by the way, you want to know who is doing that? Senator Bernie Sanders is. So I think that that's a lot more strategic, a lot more substantive than holding up a paddle. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=894.0s)]
*  You also have some Democrats who wore blue and yellow ties to support Ukraine. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=907.0s)]
*  That kind of reminded me of Senator Lindsey Graham, who earlier was also wearing a red and yellow tie. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=911.0s)]
*  He was wearing one, I'm sorry, a red, a yellow and blue tie to show his support for Ukraine. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=917.0s)]
*  He was wearing that tie, by the way, last Friday when that whole brawl happened between Vladimir Zelensky, Donald Trump and JD Vance. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=923.0s)]
*  And then after that debacle took place, Senator Graham, she's so pathetic, demanded that Zelensky step down. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=931.0s)]
*  That peace can't be made with him as the president. You gotta do your typical bootlicking of Donald Trump, right, Graham? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=940.0s)]
*  It's just so pathetic. But anyway, a group of House Democrats also took off their jackets and revealed black shirts with writing on the back. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=948.0s)]
*  Representatives Jasmine Crockett of Texas and Andrea Salinas of Oregon had shirts reading resist. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=957.0s)]
*  And Representative Maxwell Frost of Florida had one saying, no more kings. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=964.0s)]
*  Now, this is the most important part for you guys to know. So during a closed meeting with Democratic members, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=969.0s)]
*  basically leadership in the party advised them to avoid doing anything. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=976.0s)]
*  Essentially, they've taken the message and advice from James Carville, who wrote an op-ed recently telling Democrats to play dead. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=983.0s)]
*  Just give Trump enough rope to hang himself, but he's gonna be so awful that voters are gonna have no option but to come flocking back to the Democratic Party. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=990.0s)]
*  You don't even have to offer them anything. It's pathetic. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=1001.0s)]
*  But anyway, Minority Whip Catherine Clark from Massachusetts specifically asked members not to use props to protest the speech, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=1004.0s)]
*  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries encouraged members to stay on message and keep the spotlight focused on the people affected by Trump's policies, not make the story about themselves. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=1013.0s)]
*  And again, I think that's what Congressman Green was trying to do. He focused on Medicaid and Social Security. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=1025.0s)]
*  I think that should be the focus. I think that is the most important issue that Democrats need to rally around right now. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=1032.0s)]
*  But again, we're not really seeing that happening. We're not really seeing a plan. And I don't begrudge Democratic voters for being furious about it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=1039.0s)]
*  They are furious about it. They should be furious about it because voters deserve better. And we're just not getting that right now. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhVr7LvRAjQ&t=1046.0s)]
