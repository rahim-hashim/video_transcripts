"A congressional hearing on sanctuary cities descended into chaos amid a spat between Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, and Representative Ayanna Pressley, a Massachusetts Democrat.

Newsweek reached out to Comer's office for comment via email.

On Wednesday, congressional Republicans led the session on sanctuary cities, which are municipalities that protect undocumented immigrants from deportation. Immigration remains one of the most divisive political issues and a key focus of President Donald Trump, who has implemented harsher border policies since his return to the White House in January."

# House Hearing on Sanctuary Cities GOES OFF THE RAILS
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o)
*  The mayors here today each lead so called sanctuary cities. And let's be clear, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=0.0s)]
*  these policies only create sanctuary for criminals. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=5.76s)]
*  All of the mayors here today are actively working to harm the American people [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=10.24s)]
*  you represent. You all have blood on your hands. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=14.8s)]
*  Every one of you [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  is exposed to criminal culpability here. That's the reality of it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, I'm sure you guys can all tell that things were super friendly and calm. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=30.96s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. I mean, things got pretty heated today as well, four mayors from four [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=34.96s)]
*  democratic cities testified before Republicans. It was a Republican led house oversight committee [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=41.6s)]
*  hearing where they were pressed on their cities sanctuary immigration policies. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=48.8s)]
*  Now this was something that was planned weeks in advance. I was very curious to see how this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=54.32s)]
*  was going to play out or more importantly, how these democratic mayors were going to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=59.28s)]
*  answer these questions. Because I'm going to be frank with you all. There are some concerns [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=62.32s)]
*  with how some of these sanctuary city laws are written. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=69.92s)]
*  There are grounds for sanctuary city laws in my opinion that makes sense. Especially if we're [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=73.44s)]
*  dealing with a situation in which an undocumented individual is a victim of crime. They should feel [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=80.88s)]
*  comfortable reporting that crime without fear that they will be deported. That is an example [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=87.6s)]
*  of a sanctuary city law that lowers crime that is incredibly important. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  But even though not every sanctuary state or city has the exact same law, some of them are written [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=99.28s)]
*  differently. There are some downfalls based on how some of these laws are written. And it really has [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=105.6s)]
*  to do with the fact that they just don't want to cooperate with ICE or the federal government [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=111.6s)]
*  when it comes to undocumented immigrants who have committed other serious crimes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  ICE wants to deport them based on how some of these sanctuary city laws are written. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  The city, the local police do not cooperate with ICE or the federal government. And I think that's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=130.0s)]
*  where the real issue is. And that's what this hearing's about. So I watched the majority of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=136.24s)]
*  the hearing today. I was very curious to see if there were going to like there's all these [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=142.72s)]
*  little rhetorical tricks and it's so frustrating because it should be hyper focused on that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=146.72s)]
*  That one provision that has led to some issues in some cities and states. So with that in mind, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=152.0s)]
*  the witnesses that were included in this hearing were Eric Adams of New York. Now he has been [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=158.8s)]
*  far more critical in regard to the sanctuary laws that fall under his jurisdiction in New York [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=165.28s)]
*  City. You also had Mike Johnston of Denver, Brandon Johnson of Chicago and Michelle Wu, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=172.0s)]
*  who's the mayor of Boston. Now the definition of sanctuary city isn't exact, but typically [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=179.44s)]
*  it refers to the policies that limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=184.96s)]
*  and authorities, okay? So the mayors argued that their policies are crucial for ensuring [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=190.72s)]
*  that undocumented immigrants are free to report crimes and access city services without fear [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=196.16s)]
*  that they're gonna be deported. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=202.32s)]
*  Another example, for instance, is if a woman is undocumented and she's been the victim of domestic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=203.44s)]
*  abuse, she should feel free going to the authorities for safety. If you don't have any sanctuary laws [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=209.52s)]
*  protecting her, well, then she's not gonna go to the authorities and she's gonna continue getting [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=216.16s)]
*  abused. So again, I just wanna reiterate, in those cases, it makes sense. But when you have [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=220.48s)]
*  provisions that protect undocumented individuals who are literally committing crimes, have been [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  convicted of violent crimes and have spent time in prison for said violent crimes, it is a problem. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=232.88s)]
*  When ICE reaches out, asks for a detainer so then they can deport these individuals, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=239.2s)]
*  and the city doesn't cooperate. And there is evidence to show that that is going on. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=244.72s)]
*  So I'll give you some more insight into that in just a minute. Now, Republicans are accusing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=249.28s)]
*  these mayors of defying federal law and releasing dangerous criminals into the streets. In fact, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=253.6s)]
*  I was actually kind of shocked that Michelle Wu, the mayor of Boston, at one point made it seem [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=258.0s)]
*  as though she didn't know that federal law supersedes state and local laws. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=263.68s)]
*  That's just the way it works. She seemed to think that local laws supersede federal laws, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=269.44s)]
*  and that's just not the case. Now, much of the questioning had to do with the city's compliance [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=274.24s)]
*  or lack thereof with what is known as detainers. That was what Republicans wanted to talk about [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=278.96s)]
*  here, or immigration holds. So ICE detainers are requests for local law enforcement to hold a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=283.12s)]
*  defendant with an immigration case or notify the agency if they plan to release them from [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=288.32s)]
*  detention, from prison, so that the Department of Homeland Security has time to assume custody. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=294.96s)]
*  Now, an immigration hold may be placed after either a random check by ICE officers, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  who sometimes visit jails and interview inmates, or after being notified by the law enforcement [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=305.52s)]
*  agency detaining the person. Whether the law or local law enforcement agency must comply [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=311.28s)]
*  with the detainer request is a murky issue with most courts deeming the detainer request to be [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  non-mandatory. So there needs to be clarity on what is constitutional in this case. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=323.44s)]
*  And if it's murky, well, that's a problem, because the murkiness is what allows for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=330.24s)]
*  state and local politicians and officials to just decide, well, we're not gonna cooperate with the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=335.84s)]
*  federal government. And an immigration hold, by the way, I should note, is not a criminal warrant. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  So that is the argument that you'll notice a lot of the Democratic mayors make. If there's a warrant, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  then yeah, we will cooperate. But if there isn't a warrant, but we're literally talking about people [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=356.64s)]
*  who are already detained, who are already in prison because they have [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=362.0s)]
*  been convicted of carrying out a crime, and carrying out a crime in a blue city. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=366.32s)]
*  If someone has been imprisoned in a blue city, they committed a violent crime, a very violent crime. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=373.44s)]
*  Let's keep it real. Anyway, so let's keep going. So many of these sanctuary cities do have policies [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=379.12s)]
*  preventing local law enforcement from complying with the detainers. For example, I'm gonna give [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=385.44s)]
*  you a statistic that's important here. So in 2023, ICE issued 109 immigration detainers to the New [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=390.64s)]
*  York Police Department. Remember, this is under the Biden administration. So under Biden, New York [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=398.56s)]
*  City received 109 immigration detainers. They were not honored at all because the NYPD is told that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  you gotta follow through with the city laws and the city laws have sanctuary status. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=413.84s)]
*  So Chairman James Comer pressed all of the mayors on whether they would turn over criminals to ICE [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=418.32s)]
*  based on a detainer. And none explicitly answered the question. They answered the question, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=425.12s)]
*  but they didn't explicitly answer yes. And I think that's an issue. So let's take a look. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  Last year in a Boston suburb, an illegal alien raped and impregnated his 14 year old daughter [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=435.04s)]
*  while living in a shelter for illegal aliens. Mayor Wu, under Boston law, would you turn this [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=442.56s)]
*  criminal over to ICE on a detainer? Whenever there's a criminal warrant, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=449.36s)]
*  Boston police enforce that and hold people accountable. So would you turn that criminal [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=453.6s)]
*  over to ICE? This happened outside the city of Boston, but I can tell you in the city, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=460.0s)]
*  whenever someone commits a crime, whenever there's a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=465.36s)]
*  If ICE deems that they are dangerous enough to hold, obtain a criminal warrant and the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=470.0s)]
*  Boston police will enforce it. Will you turn that criminal over to ICE? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=475.2s)]
*  We follow the laws. I take that as a no. Mayor Johnson, under Chicago law, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=482.32s)]
*  would you turn this criminal over to ICE on a detainer? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=487.76s)]
*  Our local law enforcement works hard every day to get criminals off the streets of Chicago. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=493.36s)]
*  Would you turn that criminal over to ICE? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=498.08s)]
*  With a criminal warrant from the federal government, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  our local law enforcement repeatedly collaborates with federal agents. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=504.88s)]
*  Not a good look. Not a good look. I need to understand and I know people are gonna get [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  real mad at me because for some reason it's somehow difficult to differentiate between the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=519.68s)]
*  vast majority of immigrants and the small percentage of those who are here illegally [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=524.96s)]
*  and are committing crimes. I know it's so hard to make that distinction, but guess what? For me, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=532.24s)]
*  it's not that hard to make that distinction. So if someone's in the country illegally and they [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=536.48s)]
*  are currently in prison because they committed other violent crimes, please explain to me how [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=541.44s)]
*  it's a good look for these Democratic mayors to refuse to answer with the affirmative. Yes. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=547.76s)]
*  Yes, someone who has raped their 14-year-old daughter [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=554.4000000000001s)]
*  is someone who should be deported after they serve their time in our prison system. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=559.84s)]
*  So yes, in those cases, we do comply. We do work with the feds. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=564.6400000000001s)]
*  Why is it so hard to say that? I need someone to give me a real freaking answer right now, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  but no one gives me an answer because everyone wants to conflate these violent criminals [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=573.2800000000001s)]
*  who again represent a tiny, tiny percentage of immigrants with all immigrants. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=578.48s)]
*  And that's ridiculous. They're not the same. They're not the same. Just like the general [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=586.48s)]
*  population in the United States, there is a small percentage of people who end up committing violent [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  crimes. Those people should be dealt with. If they're here illegally, I'm sorry, but you don't [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=596.08s)]
*  have the right to not only just be here illegally, but to harm other people [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  while you're here illegally. But that's what's been going on in some of these cases. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=609.84s)]
*  And if you're unwilling to tweak your sanctuary city laws to ensure that these bad guys don't [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=614.16s)]
*  get away, well, then you're a problem. You're a problem not just to the people of your city. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=620.88s)]
*  You serve as a big problem to the immigrant community because these are the stories [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=627.0400000000001s)]
*  that Republicans are gonna point to to justify things like mass deportation. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=634.72s)]
*  Take a look at the public opinion polls. The majority of Americans favor what Trump is [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  doing with immigration. Why do you think that is? I just don't understand why Democrats can't get [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=644.96s)]
*  this through their thick skulls. They weren't always this unhinged, but here we are. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=651.68s)]
*  All right, Republican Jim Jordan got into a contentious back and forth with Mayor Johnston. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=656.3199999999999s)]
*  He's the mayor of Denver, involving a Venezuelan gang member who injured officers during an arrest. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  Now, because of the state's sanctuary city policy, police were forced to arrest the man in public [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=667.8399999999999s)]
*  rather than travel into the jail to detain him. Take a look. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=674.8s)]
*  Mr. Abraham Gonzalez, who's a gang member from Venezuela, stole a car, assaulted someone. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=679.76s)]
*  You had him in your custody for how long? I know that we released him. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=687.68s)]
*  345 days you had him in custody. And I said, hey, can you give us 48 hours heads up? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=691.68s)]
*  I don't know. You gave him one hour notice. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=698.3199999999999s)]
*  You said you released him to the streets. Did you release him to the streets? You released him to [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=700.0s)]
*  ICE. What we do, sir, is we release him from our county jail and we coordinate with ICE on that [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=703.2s)]
*  release time and release date so that ICE can come and pick them up from that location. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=707.76s)]
*  They were- Pick them up where? In the parking lot? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=711.84s)]
*  Yes, sir. They're on the facility property. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=714.08s)]
*  Guess what happened in the parking lot? I know, sir. I've reviewed the video. So I looked at it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=715.6s)]
*  I've talked to the sheriff last night. I've already- [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=719.52s)]
*  Well, the ICE officer's got assaulted, didn't he? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=720.8s)]
*  I've reviewed the video, sir. You had to tase the guy, didn't they? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=722.88s)]
*  Democrats have, they do have a brain virus, 100%. Okay? And it's not woke-ism. It's maximalism. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=728.08s)]
*  It's the inability to draw obvious distinctions to separate the harmful individuals from the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  vast majority of migrants and immigrants who are not causing any problems, who are not carrying out [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=747.12s)]
*  violent crimes. It's just pathetic, man. It really is. All right. The mayors pushed back on the idea [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=753.84s)]
*  that their policies were making their cities unsafe. So Boston Mayor Michelle Wu got especially [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=760.56s)]
*  spicy when asked about Tom Homan, who said last month that he would be bringing hell [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  to the city over its sanctuary policies. Homan likes to use that kind of rhetoric regularly. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=773.3599999999999s)]
*  He does it in every single interview. So I'm not surprised that he said something like that. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's hear what Michelle Wu had to say in response. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=783.1199999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about Tom Homan. Shame on him for lying about my city, for having the nerve to insult our [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  police commissioner who has overseen the safest Boston's been in anyone's lifetime. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=794.32s)]
*  Bring him here under oath and let's ask him some questions. I am here to make sure that the city [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=800.48s)]
*  of Boston is safe. Others may want to bring hell. We are here to bring peace to cities everywhere. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=806.48s)]
*  Now I have to give her some credit because to be honest with you, she was the most upfront in her [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=812.32s)]
*  belief that criminals should be apprehended. Pay special attention to the end of this clip when [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=818.0s)]
*  James Comer makes a fascinating statement. Let's watch. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=823.84s)]
*  Do you believe if people come here and break the law that they should be escorted out? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=827.84s)]
*  Or do you believe they just get to stay here forever? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=833.36s)]
*  Yes, I do believe we need cities everywhere, clearly need an immigration law that has secure [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=835.84s)]
*  borders, comprehensive and consistent compassionate pathways to residency and citizenship, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=843.76s)]
*  resources to adjudicate the complexities of the law. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=849.76s)]
*  And at the same time, I do not support mass deportation. That would be devastating for our [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=852.96s)]
*  economy. And there are millions of people who are running our small businesses going to our schools. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=859.84s)]
*  Okay. Thank you. Chair recognizes and I must add, I don't think anyone's calling for mass [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=866.96s)]
*  deportation, but chair recognizes Mr. Garcia. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=874.64s)]
*  First of all, before I get to Comer, okay. There you have it, Michelle, Michelle Wu, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=880.24s)]
*  perfect answer, perfect answer. Because in that answer, inherent in that answer, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=886.24s)]
*  is the acknowledgement that there is a difference between most people who are here, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  immigrated here, even undocumented people, most undocumented people are not committing crimes. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=899.0400000000001s)]
*  But among those who do, obviously, obviously something needs to be done about that. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=905.6800000000001s)]
*  Obviously, obviously something needs to be done about that. So I just wish that that was the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=911.9200000000001s)]
*  consistent message coming from Michelle Wu. I'm happy that at least in this case, she gave an [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=917.5200000000001s)]
*  answer like that. That's all I'm asking for from Democrats. Okay, I'm not asking Democrats to go [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=921.9200000000001s)]
*  along with Republican narratives about how dangerous all these immigrants are. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=926.32s)]
*  But there are some who are committing violent crimes. And however small that number might be [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=931.5200000000001s)]
*  in your mind, it doesn't matter, okay? Something needs to be done about these folks. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=937.04s)]
*  And if you are seen as the party that's providing cover for criminality like this, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=942.64s)]
*  first of all, it harms you electorally. And we know how much Democrats care about that. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=948.4s)]
*  That's like the most important thing for them. But for me, the most important thing [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  is to ensure that you rob the right wing of a powerful talking point that makes it appear as [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=957.1999999999999s)]
*  though all immigrants are dangerous. But that's the thing, most Democrats are just unable to do [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=965.44s)]
*  that because they're afraid. They're afraid the activists will come for them. Who cares? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=972.48s)]
*  Let the activists come for you. Do what's right. Do what's right for your city. Do what's right for [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=976.08s)]
*  the vast majority of migrants and immigrants. Just do the smart thing. Don't do the scared, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=982.24s)]
*  nonsense maximalist. No, we're gonna protect everybody regardless of what they do. It's [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=988.24s)]
*  ridiculous. All right, so Comer, let's talk about Comer. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=993.36s)]
*  Did he just say that no one's calling for mass deportations? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=999.6s)]
*  I heard that correctly, right, Kate? I heard that correctly. Yeah, she's saying yes. Yeah, okay. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1003.6800000000001s)]
*  Didn't Trump literally run his entire campaign on that issue, on mass deportations? I mean, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1008.08s)]
*  here, take a look at this. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1016.96s)]
*  I have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1017.92s)]
*  eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1024.8s)]
*  in American history, larger even than current record holder, President Dwight D. Eisenhower. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1031.04s)]
*  Let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast, he won't even believe it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1037.2s)]
*  I don't know, was that AI, Comer? Do you think we're stupid? What the? Okay, so anyway, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1040.64s)]
*  getting back to the hearing, since Eric Adams, of course, was among the witnesses, lawmakers [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1049.2800000000002s)]
*  did take the opportunity to press him about his alleged wheeling and dealing with the Trump [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1056.48s)]
*  administration, which of course led to the DOJ, I wouldn't say dropping the criminal charges. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1062.4s)]
*  He could still be prosecuted. They put a pause on his criminal charges, right? And in return, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1069.04s)]
*  many believe that Eric Adams is willing to play ball with the Trump administration when it comes [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1075.36s)]
*  to deportations. So look, he was evasive in his answers, and I wanna give you a little example [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1080.3999999999999s)]
*  of that. Mr. Mayor, we have a right to know if the Trump administration has actually coerced you into [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1087.84s)]
*  agreeing to anything. And Mayor Adams, I also wanna be very clear. Are you selling out new [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1094.08s)]
*  Yorkers to save yourself from prosecution? There's no deal, no quid pro quo, and I did [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1098.96s)]
*  nothing wrong. Have you ever talked about your case with the DOJ, with the president? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1107.92s)]
*  No more than what you heard him on the trail said that he thought it was. I haven't heard much. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1112.96s)]
*  Tell me, have you ever talked about the president and talked about your case in the DOJ with the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1118.32s)]
*  president? Yeah, as I indicated previously, I'm gonna say it again. This case is in front of Judge [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1123.28s)]
*  Ho and add a difference to him. Have you ever talked about your case with anyone in the Trump [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  administration? I'm gonna say this again. This case is in front of Judge Ho. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1137.68s)]
*  Let's keep it real. Look, obviously, we don't know what kind of private discussions are happening. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1144.96s)]
*  We can only speculate. But the Justice Department pausing the prosecution of Eric Adams, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1150.32s)]
*  of which, by the way, we have so much evidence that he engaged in illegal bribery schemes with [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1157.52s)]
*  foreign governments or foreign actors. Come on. And I'll be fair to Mayor Adams because, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1163.6799999999998s)]
*  to his credit, he was critical of the Biden administration's immigration policies [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1171.4399999999998s)]
*  well before he had been indicted on those charges. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1178.08s)]
*  So I think the Trump administration, I think Tom Homan, saw an opening, an opportunity to [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1182.8s)]
*  do a little favor for a favor. That's my speculation. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1190.16s)]
*  But look, to me, the Eric Adams debacle is really a smaller part of the bigger issue here. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1193.84s)]
*  And I just need Democrats to get a little smarter when it comes to [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1200.8s)]
*  the policies that they champion, the policies that they support, the people that they, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1204.5600000000002s)]
*  for whatever reason, think they need to protect when they don't need to protect them at all. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1209.68s)]
*  One of the things that's been driving me nuts is how every single one of those mayors talked about [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1214.24s)]
*  how, yeah, I mean, we saw a spike in undocumented immigrants coming into our cities during the Biden [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1220.3200000000002s)]
*  administration, but that didn't lead to an increase in crime. In fact, crime is down. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1227.44s)]
*  But then during the course of the hearing, they were asked whether or not they asked for [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1231.84s)]
*  the immigration status of the individuals who end up getting arrested for crimes, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1239.6799999999998s)]
*  and each one of them said no. So how are you going to argue that there's no crime happening [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1245.6799999999998s)]
*  among the migrant or immigrant community in our cities when you have no idea, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1254.3999999999999s)]
*  because you're not keeping track of it? It's just ridiculous. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1259.84s)]
*  So look, again, for me, the red line is violent crime. If ICE is reaching out asking for a detainer [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1264.24s)]
*  on an individual who is here illegally and is currently in custody because they were convicted [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1273.84s)]
*  of a violent crime, I think the city should absolutely cooperate with ICE and with the [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security specifically. That's it, but I do think there's a place for [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1284.08s)]
*  sanctuary city laws. We need to protect people who are victimized by crime themselves and wish to [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1290.0s)]
*  come forward and report it to the authorities without fear of getting deported. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1296.1599999999999s)]
*  So it's just the devil's in the details, guys. That's all it is. But if one side has a position, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1301.28s)]
*  the other side by default has to take the opposite position, I guess, even if it makes no sense. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1309.04s)]
*  So we'll see how it plays out. But right now, I don't think it's playing out well for Democrats [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1314.08s)]
*  at all. And it's certainly not playing out well for undocumented immigrants in the country who [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1317.6s)]
*  are now getting caught up in Trump's immigration policies. If you don't want the voting public to [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1322.3999999999999s)]
*  garner support for Trump's immigration policies, then you have to make sure that you're doing [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1332.1599999999999s)]
*  what's right to protect them from, again, the few individuals who do carry out violent crimes. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1338.0s)]
*  That's just not happening in some cases. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGGaEXsqe6o&t=1344.08s)]
