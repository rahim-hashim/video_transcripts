In an interview on ‚ÄúThe Tucker Carlson Show‚Äù podcast, the far-right host asked former U.S. Navy SEAL Shawn Ryan how he thinks the Trump administration is doing so far."

# Trump Gets SURPRISING Criticism For Corrupt Middle East Deals
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0)
*  There's things like the energy grid. And it's like, man, we really need to do something with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=0.0s)]
*  our grid like yesterday. And- But is that more important than bombing Iran? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=6.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I wanna know what the real motivations are. I like what they've done with Doge. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=13.36s)]
*  I think that maybe they've cut a little bit more than they need to. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=23.36s)]
*  Well, you just heard an unlikely figure criticize Donald Trump and his second term. And when I say [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=27.04s)]
*  unlikely figure, I'm talking about Sean Ryan, who is a former Navy SEAL and was on Tucker Carlson's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=35.44s)]
*  podcast to talk about a whole host of issues, political topics, and even the Trump administration. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=42.32s)]
*  Now, what was really interesting, one of the more fascinating moments during their conversation had [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=49.68s)]
*  to do with corruption. Let's take a look. I see all these negotiations going on in the Middle East. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=55.52s)]
*  And then I don't know when these buildings were approved or when these deals got done. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=62.56s)]
*  But then I also see like, there's a brand new hotel going up in Dubai or Abu Dhabi and another [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=66.4s)]
*  one going up in Doha, I think. And I'm like, did these just get done also with the deals that just [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=71.2s)]
*  happened over there or was this earlier? You would probably know. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=81.12s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=84.72s)]
*  You don't? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  I've not made $1 in the Middle East, no one. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=87.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, you're allowing me more on the inside than I am. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm just a visitor and a traveler and a watcher, but that stuff kind of worries me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=95.28s)]
*  What seems like corruption, yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Now, understand they're talking about Trump properties getting built in various foreign [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=104.8s)]
*  countries. He's talking about deals that Donald Trump is making as the President of the United [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=113.2s)]
*  States in foreign countries that obviously benefit him, his family, his business. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=117.84s)]
*  But that can't be true, cuz I heard that none of them would ever defy Trump on a single issue. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's interesting that you say that, Jay, because I wanna go to the next clip, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=130.24s)]
*  get a load of this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=133.68s)]
*  You know what bothers me more than any of this is that people have just lost the ability to critical [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=135.36s)]
*  think. And if you do say something about the tariffs or is it Greenland or Iceland, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=140.16s)]
*  I can't even remember, or whatever. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=149.68s)]
*  The big one. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=151.28s)]
*  If you do, if you throw any criticism towards any, and not just Trump, but anybody [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  that is in a position of power. I mean, the US has just become so tribal now, and you cannot [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=160.32s)]
*  criticize or give any constructive criticism to what's happening without getting blasted and sad. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=168.0s)]
*  It's like, man, you guys have 100% lost all critical thinking skills. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=178.56s)]
*  I agree with every word. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=184.88s)]
*  I love what he said there, Cenk. I love it. And I wanna start a trend in this country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=188.72s)]
*  I wanna start a movement, okay? People who engage in that kind of tribal thinking, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  we need to make them unpopular. They should feel like, that's super cringe, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  It shouldn't be popular to be a brain dead partisan that defends your side, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=211.76s)]
*  regardless of what your side does. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=217.6s)]
*  It would be hilarious if we cancel the cancellers. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=219.84s)]
*  Yes, why can't we do that? Let's do that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=222.48s)]
*  Okay, but so- [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  That calls for better politicians, better public servants. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=227.12s)]
*  Right. Now look, seriously, my take on it is, if you're in the camp of, look, if you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  ever agree with a right-winger, even if they're agreeing with you, or you ever talk to a right-winger, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=238.32s)]
*  or by the way, if you ever talk to, if you're a radical right and you say, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=243.68s)]
*  never talk to a left-winger, never agree with a left-winger, never criticize Trump, etc. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=246.72s)]
*  If you're in those camps, no, I don't need to cancel. You can keep being who you are, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=251.12s)]
*  right? But for the rest of us, we just gotta get past them, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=255.6s)]
*  So I get it, that's what you do. If you see someone saying that you should follow certain [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=259.44s)]
*  ideology 100%, what they're saying to you is, don't use your brain, use my brain. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=264.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=269.12s)]
*  Okay? Don't you dare do critical thinking, okay? You must follow a strict ideology. You [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=269.44s)]
*  waver 1%, and we're gonna call you whatever names. So a communist Marxist from the right, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=274.64s)]
*  Nazi racist from the left, right? So you see people doing that, they're saying, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=280.56s)]
*  I don't believe in you. I don't think your mind is good enough. I think that you should [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=285.6s)]
*  suspend all independent thinking and just rely on me because I've got the right propaganda, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=290.0s)]
*  I mean ideology, okay? So for the rest of us, we should start to not cancel them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  They can say anything they like, but start to kind of feel bad for them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=300.48s)]
*  It's cringe. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=306.0s)]
*  Like it's a little sad, right? I'm gonna go be maximalist on the right or the left. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=306.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=313.04s)]
*  So there is no middle ground and I hate the middle ground. And I don't mean like you should [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=313.44s)]
*  pick a policy in the middle. I mean, maybe we meet each other in the middle and go, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=317.92s)]
*  you're anti-war, I'm anti-war. Instead of going, I don't believe you. If you say it [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=321.68s)]
*  because you're on the wrong tribe, if you're in the wrong tribe, I never believe a word you said. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=326.24s)]
*  All right, all right, but that's a person saying, I'm not even using critical thinking. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=331.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm just using blanket. Okay, if you did this, then I hate you forever. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=335.44s)]
*  Okay, that's how a radical thinks. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=340.56s)]
*  So this is a problem in the country that goes, I think it goes well beyond the political [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=342.08s)]
*  realm. Because I don't know how this developed in the United States, but I do think it's an issue [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=349.12s)]
*  where people have difficulty with constructive feedback, right? Like with the Democratic party, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=355.44s)]
*  we just experienced that when it came to Biden's mental decline. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=362.64s)]
*  But let's take the politics out of it. I'll give you an anecdote. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=365.44s)]
*  So there's a publication that I submitted a piece to and the editors, they love the piece, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=368.96s)]
*  but they wanted to edit it, right? So we went back and forth. And one of the editors [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  was so apologetic about, just know that I really like your piece and I apologize for the markups [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=381.44s)]
*  because he was afraid that I was gonna get angry or upset at the feedback, at the constructive [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=389.12s)]
*  feedback to make my piece better, by the way. And I wrote back and I was like, don't ever apologize [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=397.28s)]
*  to me again for doing your job. I'm not offended by this at all. You're making my piece better. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=403.11999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I had an editor when I wrote in a college paper, he made every one of my pieces better. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=408.08s)]
*  So that's what a good editor is. By the way, mainstream media editors just talked to a reporter [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  today. I won't tell you which publication because I don't wanna burn anyone. But they were like, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=417.28s)]
*  yeah, we wanna write the pieces about rebellion pack and populism, etc. Our editors kill it almost [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=422.32s)]
*  every time. Of course. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=428.48s)]
*  Okay, so the mainstream media editors are the worst. They're like, wow, what is their status? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=429.52s)]
*  Oh, they don't have enough status. We will not be publishing them. Anyway, so that's an aside. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=437.68s)]
*  Now back to Sean Ryan and Tucker Carlson here. Guys, okay, so put Tucker aside for a second [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=443.2s)]
*  because I know you mentioned the name Tucker Carlson and people lose their minds, right? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=448.0s)]
*  So look at Sean Ryan. He's saying, don't go to war. Let's use critical thinking, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=452.56s)]
*  calling out Donald Trump's corruption. Even if you think he's on the right- [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=458.56s)]
*  He is on the right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=462.88s)]
*  Yeah, that, okay. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=463.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=465.04s)]
*  I don't know him at all. I don't know him from Adam. Okay, so he's on the right. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=465.44s)]
*  Can you take yes for an answer? If you hear people say no, don't take yes for an answer [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=470.56s)]
*  because it'll stain us. It'll ruin our moral purity if we agree with Sean Ryan. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=475.52s)]
*  Okay, then you have your answer. That's a person who says, I don't care about policy. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=482.32s)]
*  I don't care about policy at all. Tucker Carlson agrees with us on not going to war with Iran. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=487.12s)]
*  I don't want his help even though Trump is much more likely to listen to him. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=491.35999999999996s)]
*  Why? Because my moral purity as a radical is more important than stopping a war with Iran. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so understand that you're talking to a radical. You're hearing a radical when they [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=501.68s)]
*  say that. When somebody says, I care about saving lives in Iran, in Gaza, etc. And I'll take all the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=506.16s)]
*  help I can get to save those lives. That's a person who cares about policy, right? So that's [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=512.08s)]
*  your distinction. And if you're still watching Tucker Carlson tell you a hundred times that he [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=518.24s)]
*  doesn't want to go to war with Iran, and you go, no, he's lying, then wait, who's he lying to? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=523.12s)]
*  He's not saying it to you. He's saying it to his audience. If he's told his audience a hundred [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=529.36s)]
*  times that they shouldn't be in favor of going to war with Iran, what difference does it make [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=533.44s)]
*  if he's lying or not? Because that audience is still getting the same message. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=536.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=540.72s)]
*  And you should encourage that message instead of saying, I don't believe you. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=541.2s)]
*  That's it, you're on the right. I'm not gonna do anything with you. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=546.24s)]
*  Okay, just please, please. It's egotistical, it's selfish, and it's disgusting. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=549.44s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=555.04s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWeITpsqg0&t=558.16s)]
