"Republicans will make their case on Capitol Hill this week for reining in federal judges, amid an escalating clash between President Donald Trump and the courts that have blocked, at least temporarily, many of his key priorities.

Both the House and Senate will hold hearings on the federal judiciary, and House lawmakers are expected to vote on a bill to bar courts from issuing nationwide injunctions. The odds of the bill becoming law are long."

# Republican CALLED OUT For Posting Wanted Posters Of Judges
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY)
*  This is one floor below my office in front of Representative Ogles office wanted posters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=0.0s)]
*  of judges. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=6.3s)]
*  It says no get Trump judicial activists wanted. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=7.3s)]
*  And this is the kind of stuff that some of us are asking there to be universal condemnation [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=10.92s)]
*  about. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's certainly something I can agree with. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=16.28s)]
*  Yesterday, Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern revealed that his fellow lawmaker, Republican [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=19.28s)]
*  Representative Andy Ogles has a wanted poster with photos of judges outside of his office. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=25.12s)]
*  Now here's a closer look at the poster in question. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=32.8s)]
*  And what it features are the judges who decided to rule against some of the executive orders [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=36.64s)]
*  or actions that have been taken by the Trump administration thus far, either through a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  temporary block or by striking the executive order down. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=47.46s)]
*  And while other Republicans aren't going as far as Ogles is, they are looking into ways [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  to essentially kneecap the judicial branch. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=56.76s)]
*  In fact, Elon Musk just spoke out against judges ruling against Trump today on the five. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  Let's take a look at what he had to say. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  All the president is trying to do is implement the will of the people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=68.56s)]
*  And they're trying to stop the will of the people through judicial trickery. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  And in fact, in general, there is a huge problem with activists that are actually politicians [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=78.76s)]
*  in judges robes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=84.64s)]
*  And that needs to stop. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  It's undermining the integrity, the reality and the perception of the integrity of the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=88.2s)]
*  legal system of the United States. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=92.44s)]
*  And these fake judges should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=95.16s)]
*  They're just pretending to be judges, but they're making the law instead of implementing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=99.0s)]
*  the law. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  So he's arguing, well, these judges are going against the will of the people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=108.0s)]
*  And so as a result, what we're gonna kneecap the judicial branch. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=111.56s)]
*  And it's interesting because I hear a lot about the tyranny of the majority from Republicans [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=115.32s)]
*  oftentimes and how it's important to keep the electoral college in place. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=120.0s)]
*  Because you want representation in the less populated states in our union. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=124.08s)]
*  Look, you need judges to adjudicate whether or not the executive branch or Congress is [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=130.84s)]
*  carrying out their duties while abiding by what the Constitution and what the rule of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=137.72s)]
*  law entails. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=143.36s)]
*  And if you want to kneecap that in order to create a king-like scenario within the executive [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=145.4s)]
*  branch, you're advocating for something that goes against this country and what this country [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=150.6s)]
*  is supposed to be. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so a little bit later, I'm gonna tell you how much I despise activist judges. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  And so if anybody was gonna agree with Elon Musk, if he's made a good point, it would [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=162.08s)]
*  be me in that regard. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=166.12s)]
*  And I'm gonna point out some Democratic hypocrisy on this issue. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=168.68s)]
*  There's too solid a piece of hypocrisy here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=171.68s)]
*  But on what Musk is saying, well, brother, okay, so you're saying they're unelected. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=175.24s)]
*  But a lot of judges are unelected. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=180.32s)]
*  So does that mean we shouldn't have judges? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense at all. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk is unelected. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you're unelected. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  Totally and utterly. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  And you didn't go through any system other than I gave Trump $288 million for his campaign. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  So please spare me the unelected crap, okay? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=195.2s)]
*  But more importantly, why do we need judges? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=198.72s)]
*  Because of due process, oops, we sent two wrong people to El Salvador because we didn't [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=201.88s)]
*  give them due process. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=205.28s)]
*  Number two, when you say, hey, Congress appropriated this money, but I don't wanna spend it, well, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=206.6s)]
*  that's unconstitutional. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=210.56s)]
*  And so that's what you need the courts to adjudicate. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=212.14s)]
*  Well, should you spend it or shouldn't you spend it? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  Who has the legal authority to adjudicate that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=216.12s)]
*  But judges, they're the only ones who have that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  If you ask Congress, Congress is gonna say they're right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  If you ask the executive branch, they're gonna say they're right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=223.52s)]
*  That's why you need courts. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're really making us defend our entire system of government and our constitution [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  and the fact that a judiciary should exist. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  You know who doesn't want a judiciary? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=235.0s)]
*  People who wanna be lawless and wanna be tyrants. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=236.56s)]
*  And I'll give you one last one. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=239.32000000000002s)]
*  When you fire people, we have to know why you fire them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=240.36s)]
*  There's a lot of laws around that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  They might be in a union. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=244.28s)]
*  I know you hate unions, but they do protect people's jobs. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=245.28s)]
*  That money might have been appropriated. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  For example, if Elon wanted to come in and say, so what? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=250.48s)]
*  It's my company or it's now my country since I'm the number one donor, okay? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=253.8s)]
*  Even in his own company, he couldn't do that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  Cuz what if he fired someone because they wouldn't sleep with him? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=261.4s)]
*  That would be illegal and who would adjudicate that? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=263.74s)]
*  A judge would. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=266.24s)]
*  So this whole thing of like, we don't need no stinking judges is 100% an argument for [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=267.44s)]
*  tyranny. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=273.4s)]
*  And what's good for the goose is good for the gander. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=274.44s)]
*  So you wanna open up a situation in which you weaken the courts and solidify even more [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=277.3s)]
*  power in the executive branch. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  Trump's not the only one who's gonna benefit from that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=285.66s)]
*  Democrat can come in, Democrat can abuse their power as well without having to worry about [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=288.66s)]
*  the courts that have been weakened by the previous administration. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  Just think about that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=295.12s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=296.12s)]
*  So let's get to the details in regard to what members of Congress are trying to do here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=297.12s)]
*  Because Republicans have tried different schemes that haven't really worked out for them and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=301.6s)]
*  now they're trying something new. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=305.0s)]
*  So in his second term, Trump has issued 107 executive orders, thus far at least. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=306.84s)]
*  And according to the Washington Post, that's more than any other president in the last [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=313.94s)]
*  four decades. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=317.62s)]
*  Now, many of those orders have been challenged in the court. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=318.62s)]
*  So the Trump administration has been hit with about 150 lawsuits so far. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=321.86s)]
*  And judges have put 40 blocks on Trump's agenda, including but not limited to firing federal [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  workers, blocking federal grant money, ending birthright citizenship, and banning transgender [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=334.58s)]
*  troops from the military. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=340.7s)]
*  Those are just some examples. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=342.18s)]
*  Now Trump has insisted that his administration will comply with court orders, but he has [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=343.7s)]
*  also called for federal judges blocking his agenda to be impeached. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't happen, okay? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=355.12s)]
*  Judges don't get impeached because you don't like their ruling. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=356.58s)]
*  A judge in fact has never been impeached for their rulings. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=359.97999999999996s)]
*  And it seems that some Republicans also don't wanna open that Pandora's box to their credit. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=363.74s)]
*  So hardline Trump supporters in Congress crafted legislation to impeach US District Court Judge [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=370.18s)]
*  James E. Boesberg and other judges who had ruled against the president. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=375.22s)]
*  House GOP leadership worked to tamp down that push to their credit. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=380.06s)]
*  However saying it is a political non-starter, given opposition among some Republicans and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=386.1s)]
*  the two-thirds Senate majority required to remove a judge. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=391.54s)]
*  Now some House Republicans are considering defunding federal courts, which I mean, it's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=395.86s)]
*  amazing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=404.86s)]
*  It's just amazing to me how whenever it's convenient, people wanna defund certain things, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=406.46s)]
*  right? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=410.54s)]
*  But they've brought that up, let's defund the federal courts. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=411.54s)]
*  But that might not make it through the Senate either. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=414.72s)]
*  In fact, Republican Senator John Kennedy, Republican Senator said this. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=416.82s)]
*  I'm not going to support defunding an independent and equal branch of government and I'm not [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=421.82s)]
*  going to support impeaching a federal judge unless you can prove to me that he or she [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=425.94s)]
*  has committed a crime or misdemeanor. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=431.41999999999996s)]
*  Not a big fan of Senator Kennedy, but I give him major props for that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=434.7s)]
*  He's absolutely right in his stance here. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=438.86s)]
*  And that's why congressional Republicans have turned to the idea of banning nationwide [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=441.76s)]
*  injunctions. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=447.28s)]
*  So I'm gonna pause here and go to Cenk to explain what an injunction is. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=448.28s)]
*  Yeah, so before I get to that, just real quick, if you are defund the courts, that's actually [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=452.48s)]
*  a step higher than defunding the police, cuz you're defunding the law. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  If there are no courts, how do we put anybody in prison? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=463.2s)]
*  Do we just say, the executive branch is now king, and they can put anyone they like in [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=468.24s)]
*  prison and there are no courts to check them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  What kind of lunatic conversation are we having when we're talking about defunding the court [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=475.24s)]
*  system? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, that's the current lunatic conversation in Congress. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  So if you're a right winger and you scoffed at all the Democrats saying that Republicans [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=483.72s)]
*  were gonna be fascist or authoritarian and they weren't gonna listen to the courts. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=489.64s)]
*  Again, you should be way more angry than we are, because they're proving Joe Biden right, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=494.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris right, they're proving every Democrat right, they're proving MSNBC right, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=499.84s)]
*  by saying, yeah, let's defund law. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=504.59999999999997s)]
*  Who cares about courts? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=507.64s)]
*  That's crazy, that's nuts. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=509.68s)]
*  Okay, so now the injunctions. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  So an injunction is just a court saying, hold on, you can't do that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=514.98s)]
*  First, we have to adjudicate it, and then we'll lift the injunction after we have a [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=518.68s)]
*  ruling saying you can or can't do that, right? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=522.56s)]
*  And now that could be on a simple local matter or now they're doing it on a nationwide matters. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=526.1199999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=531.16s)]
*  Because they're being forced into it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=532.16s)]
*  This didn't happen that often before. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=534.3599999999999s)]
*  George W Bush only had six injunction national injunctions during his term, Obama at 12, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=536.3599999999999s)]
*  Biden at 14. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=541.64s)]
*  Trump had 64 in his first term and he's well on his way to passing that record. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=543.68s)]
*  Now why? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=548.04s)]
*  Because he keeps doing things that aren't even close to legal. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=549.4s)]
*  So for when he says, you know what, I'm gonna take away birthright citizenship, even though [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=552.78s)]
*  it's in the Constitution. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=556.88s)]
*  The court doesn't have a choice, you can't say, okay, I'll give you an injunction in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=558.92s)]
*  Rhode Island, but I don't care if you do it in the other 49 states. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=563.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=566.48s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=567.48s)]
*  So they're forced into it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=568.48s)]
*  Now, I'll give you one of the teasers here. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=569.48s)]
*  The Democrats are huge hypocrites on this. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=573.06s)]
*  They were also against national injunctions when Biden was getting the national injunctions [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  from judges. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=581.4799999999999s)]
*  But I'll come back to that when I talk about activist judges. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  So in regard to what Republicans in Congress are trying to do here with the injunctions, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=585.4s)]
*  let's go to Senator Chuck Grassley who wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal explaining [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=591.0s)]
*  why he wrote a bill that would ban the nationwide injunctions. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=595.64s)]
*  It reads, under my bill, lower courts could no longer block legitimate executive action. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=600.94s)]
*  Well, how do you determine if it's legitimate executive action? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=605.46s)]
*  Wouldn't the judges determine if it's legitimate executive action? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=608.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=611.5400000000001s)]
*  But let me continue. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=612.5400000000001s)]
*  Legitimate executive action by issuing orders to nonparties to the lawsuit. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=613.9000000000001s)]
*  The bill would also make temporary restraining orders against the government immediately [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=618.1600000000001s)]
*  appealable to make sure that prudence wins out over rash decisions handed down in the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=622.6600000000001s)]
*  heat of a political moment. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=629.0999999999999s)]
*  Now Grassley called on Democrats to support his bill stating that 240 Democratic lawmakers, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=631.8599999999999s)]
*  including Senators Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin in 2023 submitted a friend of the court [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=638.5s)]
*  brief warning of the perilous consequences resulting from a district judge's move to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=643.8599999999999s)]
*  block the abortion pill, Mifepristone. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=650.06s)]
*  So what he's specifically referring to is Democratic Senator Maisie Hirono introducing [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  a bill in 2023 that would render the US District Court in DC the only court in the country [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=660.02s)]
*  that could implement a nationwide injunction. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=667.22s)]
*  So this also goes to what you were saying, Cenk, about the hypocrisy of the Democrats. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=670.48s)]
*  And this is a point that I was trying to make earlier in the show. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=675.84s)]
*  Again, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=678.48s)]
*  When you think that weakening the courts is going to benefit your party and your party [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=681.56s)]
*  alone, you're making a big mistake because your party's not always gonna be the one in [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=686.52s)]
*  charge. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=690.56s)]
*  Yeah, so number one, okay, let me explain why I hate activist judges and justices. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=691.56s)]
*  On Citizens United alone, that's a good enough claim for it, right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=697.16s)]
*  I can get into many other decisions, but Lewis Powell in his 1971 memo that I explained in [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=702.04s)]
*  Justice is Coming literally called for the right wing to create, he said it literally, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=706.88s)]
*  activist judges. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=713.08s)]
*  He's like, well, because we're not winning in a democracy and corporations are hated [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=714.08s)]
*  and they're serving the consumers too much and the citizens too much. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  So we need activist judges to say that the corporations should be allowed to rule the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=723.92s)]
*  country. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=728.52s)]
*  So their number one way that they wound up doing that, with Lewis Powell actually being [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=729.52s)]
*  the deciding voter in a couple of these cases in the 1970s, was they said money is speech, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=732.96s)]
*  speech is protected, so you can spend unlimited money in politics. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=738.6s)]
*  That is not in the Constitution at all. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=743.1600000000001s)]
*  They made up both of those things. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=745.1600000000001s)]
*  They made up three things. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=746.6s)]
*  One was earlier, corporations are human beings, not in the Constitution, activist judges, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=748.2s)]
*  okay, justices. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  The money is speech and that you have an unlimited right to give money to politicians. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=754.36s)]
*  All three are totally, utterly made up by corporate backed activist justices. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=758.68s)]
*  So I despise activism and I've been conservative legally for a long, long time. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  We've talked about that in different parts, okay? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=769.28s)]
*  And by the way, as you might have known if you watch Young Turks for a long time, that's [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=772.5999999999999s)]
*  why I was also against Roe v Wade. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=777.3399999999999s)]
*  I love it as legislation, but the courts invented trimesters in the Constitution. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=778.8399999999999s)]
*  That's my opinion. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=783.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so now you turn to the Democrats and they go, okay, well, since activist judges [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=784.98s)]
*  are bad, and then they're blocking Biden's agenda, let's get rid of nationwide injunctions. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=789.7s)]
*  But again, that doesn't make any sense. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=795.6400000000001s)]
*  If the president is doing an executive order that applies to the whole country, by definition, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=798.5400000000001s)]
*  you have to have it apply to the whole country. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=804.2600000000001s)]
*  So I can't stand the way the parties are so hypocritical when they're in charge versus [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=806.5400000000001s)]
*  the other guys in charge. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=811.22s)]
*  Now what leg does Dick Durbin or any of these other guys have to stand on when they literally [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=812.46s)]
*  were pushing just like a minute ago, literally a couple of months ago. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=817.5400000000001s)]
*  The idea of we should have nationwide injunctions for these judges. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=821.62s)]
*  So that's an attack on the judiciary itself. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=824.94s)]
*  It's not a way to clean up the activist judges, it's not a way to fix the system. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=827.82s)]
*  It's an attack on the system itself. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=831.9000000000001s)]
*  And last one, Democrats also wanted to stack the court, if you remember the Supreme Court. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=833.46s)]
*  And I was totally against it. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=837.98s)]
*  And people at the time were like, why, why are you against it? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=839.6600000000001s)]
*  No, because if we pack it, they pack it and then it gets into nonsense. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=842.66s)]
*  A lot of judges, can you imagine? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=845.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=847.18s)]
*  Like 500 Supreme Court justices. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=848.18s)]
*  Imagine if they had done that, which again, it's such a bad idea. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKn8WzYqNY&t=849.18s)]
