# SCOTUS Hears Birthright Citizenship Case. Trump Touts Gaza TAKEOVER. - May 15, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o)
*  All right, welcome to the Turks, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=0.0s)]
*  Jake Huger, Jordan Yule with you [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2.68s)]
*  guys. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=5.4s)]
*  Jordan Yule of Rebel HQ fame and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=7.54s)]
*  the host of the insurgents, which [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=9.52s)]
*  is really a badass name for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=11.58s)]
*  a podcast. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=13.06s)]
*  Let's be honest about it, okay? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=13.66s)]
*  So now, hell of a show for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=16.12s)]
*  you guys in the first hour alone. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=18.28s)]
*  So at the end of the hour, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=21.66s)]
*  we're asking this question on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=23.28s)]
*  tyt.com, and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=25.28s)]
*  we're going to try to answer it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=26.16s)]
*  I don't even know what my answer [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=27.92s)]
*  is. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=29.68s)]
*  You don't hear that often, but [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=30.18s)]
*  I want to hear Jordan's opinion. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=32.0s)]
*  I want to get to it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=33.84s)]
*  Anyway, the question is, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=34.64s)]
*  should Kanye West's pro-Hitler song [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=36.14s)]
*  be banned on all platforms? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=38.28s)]
*  It's not whether you think it's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=40.44s)]
*  a good song. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=41.86s)]
*  No, it's terrible that he did that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=42.36s)]
*  song, terrible. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=44.36s)]
*  The question is, should it be banned? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Or is it more productive or [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=47.6s)]
*  counterproductive to ban it? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=49.04s)]
*  So again, I don't know the answer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  We're going to figure it out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  But also, several disastrous [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  things for Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  You're not surprised about that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=57.28s)]
*  We'll get to that right in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=58.32s)]
*  the beginning, and then we got [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=59.44s)]
*  an amazing, terrible story about [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  political correctness in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=62.32s)]
*  the second hour. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=63.52s)]
*  But also, potentially, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  really positive development? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=66.52s)]
*  Potentially, potentially, maybe. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=69.8s)]
*  So hold on, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=72.6s)]
*  let's see what happens. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=73.16s)]
*  All right, Jordan, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=73.92s)]
*  what do you got for us? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=74.76s)]
*  We have so much jank. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=75.72s)]
*  Let's jump right into it, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=78.48s)]
*  starting with this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=80.44s)]
*  President Trump's battle to end [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=82.12s)]
*  birthright citizenship, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=84.0s)]
*  taking center stage at [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  the Supreme Court today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=86.72s)]
*  You claim that there is absolutely [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=88.04s)]
*  no constitutional way to stop, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=90.92s)]
*  put this aside, to stop a president [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=93.88s)]
*  from an unconstitutional act, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=96.92s)]
*  a clearly, indisputably [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=99.76s)]
*  unconstitutional act. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=101.88s)]
*  I disagree with that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=104.12s)]
*  The Supreme Court heard oral [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=107.8s)]
*  arguments today in a case about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=109.44s)]
*  the enforcement of President Trump's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=111.32s)]
*  order to ban birthright citizenship. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=113.68s)]
*  The main question is not [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=116.2s)]
*  birthright citizenship itself, but [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=117.56s)]
*  rather whether lower courts [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=119.68s)]
*  overstepped their authority by [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  blocking that order on a nationwide [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=122.88s)]
*  basis. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=124.76s)]
*  Before we get to the oral [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=125.4s)]
*  arguments, we're going to hear from [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, who went on one of his [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=128.52s)]
*  classic truth social rants [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=130.44s)]
*  earlier this morning. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=131.96s)]
*  But first, Cenk, I know you have [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=134.28s)]
*  a lot of thoughts on birthright [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=135.72s)]
*  citizenship, it was in part one of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=137.04s)]
*  the reasons it helped inspire your [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=138.88s)]
*  candidacy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=140.72s)]
*  What do you make of this case and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=141.36s)]
*  how do you think the Supreme Court [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=143.4s)]
*  will rule? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=145.52s)]
*  Yeah, so [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=146.44s)]
*  there's three different issues here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=146.96s)]
*  So number one is birthright [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=149.16s)]
*  citizenship, which should be an [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=150.52s)]
*  arguable. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=152.28s)]
*  By the way, a little topsy turvy [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=152.88s)]
*  there, Jordan. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  So I'm a naturalized citizen, so [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=155.28s)]
*  I believe that all birthright [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=157.08s)]
*  citizenship should be taken away, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=158.56s)]
*  so I'm one of the few citizens left. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=160.44s)]
*  No, seriously, but I do have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=162.28s)]
*  nephews who have birthright [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  citizenship, etc., because that's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=166.84s)]
*  how we get citizenship. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=169.56s)]
*  You're born here, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=171.4s)]
*  that's usually the number one way. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Anyways, but there's also [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  the issue of these injunctions from [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=175.88s)]
*  the lower courts, that sounds [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=178.16s)]
*  wonky, but it was really important. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=180.28s)]
*  And maybe most important issue, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=183.0s)]
*  which was Amy Coney Barrett [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=185.2s)]
*  grilling the Trump administration [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=187.04s)]
*  on whether they're going to listen [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=189.4s)]
*  to court orders at all. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=191.56s)]
*  And then there was one very clear [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=193.56s)]
*  answer to that, and then one [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=195.24s)]
*  disastrous answer to that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=196.68s)]
*  So there's a lot to get to here and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=198.44s)]
*  sort out. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=200.36s)]
*  So Jordan, take it away and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=201.44s)]
*  then we'll analyze. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=202.88s)]
*  Let's get to that rant from Donald [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump, he posted this on [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  Truth Social. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=208.0s)]
*  Birthright citizenship was not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=209.32s)]
*  meant for people taking vacations [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=211.48s)]
*  to become permanent citizens of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  the United States of America and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  bringing their families with them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=217.76s)]
*  All the time laughing at the, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  quote, suckers that we are. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  The United States of America is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  the only country in the world that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=225.92s)]
*  does this, for what reason, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=228.0s)]
*  nobody knows. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=229.88s)]
*  But the drug cartels love it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  For the sake of being politically [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=233.28s)]
*  correct, a stupid country. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  But in actuality, this is the exact [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=238.6s)]
*  opposite of being politically [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  correct. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=242.72s)]
*  And it is yet another point that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=243.56s)]
*  leads to the dysfunction of America. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=245.56s)]
*  Birthright citizenship is about [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=248.2s)]
*  the babies of slaves. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  It had nothing to do with illegal [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=252.11999999999998s)]
*  immigration for people wanting to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=253.88s)]
*  scam our country from all parts of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=255.72s)]
*  the world, which they have done for [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=257.56s)]
*  many years. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=259.56s)]
*  Thank you for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=261.2s)]
*  your attention to this matter. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=262.2s)]
*  But first of all, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=264.64s)]
*  his repeated claim that the US is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=265.76s)]
*  the only country with birthright [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=267.76s)]
*  citizenship is flat out incorrect, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=269.64s)]
*  as you can see in this map. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=271.79999999999995s)]
*  There are about 30 other countries [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=274.32s)]
*  that do the same thing, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=276.24s)]
*  including both of our neighbors. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  You can see the full list over [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=279.96s)]
*  on the right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=281.68s)]
*  Secondly, the 14th Amendment [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=282.88s)]
*  literally could not be any clearer. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=285.28s)]
*  All persons born or naturalized in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=288.48s)]
*  the United States and subject to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=290.8s)]
*  the jurisdiction thereof are [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=293.08s)]
*  citizens of the United States and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=295.24s)]
*  of the state wherein they reside. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=297.6s)]
*  So we've established that Trump is [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=299.92s)]
*  flat out wrong. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=301.92s)]
*  But now let's go back to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=303.72s)]
*  the Supreme Court case, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=304.64s)]
*  because that's not nearly as clear [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=305.72s)]
*  as Trump's BS arguments against [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=307.44s)]
*  the merits of birthright citizenship. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=309.0s)]
*  Before we hear from the justices, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=311.4s)]
*  here's CBS's legal expert explaining [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=313.56s)]
*  what this case, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=316.04s)]
*  stemming from Trump's executive [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=317.16s)]
*  order, is really about. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=319.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=320.6s)]
*  Many people sued, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=322.44s)]
*  federal judges issued these things [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=323.44s)]
*  called nationwide injunctions. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=325.4s)]
*  Meaning that the executive order [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=327.16s)]
*  can't go into effect, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=329.04s)]
*  not just with respect to the parties [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=330.28s)]
*  who sued, but with respect to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=332.28s)]
*  everybody nationwide. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=333.96s)]
*  And so the question that the court [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=335.6s)]
*  is struggling with is, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=337.44s)]
*  do federal judges have the power [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=338.72s)]
*  to do that? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=340.48s)]
*  Do they have the power to say, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=341.04s)]
*  this executive order, stop it, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=343.0s)]
*  halt it, not just for the people [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=345.2s)]
*  who walked into my courtroom and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=347.32s)]
*  asked me, but with respect to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=349.36s)]
*  everybody, it cannot be implemented [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=351.28s)]
*  anywhere? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=353.56s)]
*  So as we wait for the court's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=354.28s)]
*  decision, we can only make [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  inferences based on some of the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=358.56s)]
*  lines of questioning from [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=360.84s)]
*  the justices. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  And so far, from what we can tell, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=363.84s)]
*  some of the conservative justices [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=366.24s)]
*  seem open to siding with [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=370.12s)]
*  According to CNN, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=372.08s)]
*  several conservative justices [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=373.52s)]
*  signaled deep reservations with [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=375.48s)]
*  the ability of lower courts to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=377.56s)]
*  issue nationwide injunctions. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=379.44s)]
*  But at the same time, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=381.52s)]
*  seem to be searching for other ways [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=382.76s)]
*  people could, in the short term, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=384.92s)]
*  stop a policy that would upend more [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=387.08s)]
*  than a century of understanding [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=389.36s)]
*  about American citizenship. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=391.52s)]
*  The liberals, however, pressed [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=393.44s)]
*  solicitor General D. John Sauer on [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=396.04s)]
*  what taking away power from lower [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=398.64s)]
*  courts is a very important [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  thing lower courts would mean. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=403.12s)]
*  Justice Sotomayor gave Sauer [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=405.76s)]
*  a hypothetical about what could [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  happen with a different president [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=409.08s)]
*  in charge. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=411.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=411.64s)]
*  You claim that there is absolutely [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=412.64s)]
*  no constitutional way to stop, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=415.8s)]
*  put this aside, to stop a president [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=418.8s)]
*  from an unconstitutional act, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=422.04s)]
*  a clearly indisputably unconstitutional [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=424.96s)]
*  act. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=428.48s)]
*  So when a new president orders [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=429.0s)]
*  that because there's so [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  much gun violence going on in [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=433.08s)]
*  the country, and he comes in and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=435.0s)]
*  he says, I have the right to take [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=437.24s)]
*  away the guns from everyone. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=439.68s)]
*  Then people, and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=441.88s)]
*  he sends out the military to seize [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=443.4s)]
*  everyone's guns, we and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=446.36s)]
*  the courts have to sit back and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=448.52s)]
*  wait until every named plaintiff [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=451.2s)]
*  gets or every plaintiff whose gun [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  is taken, and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=456.76s)]
*  comes into court. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=458.08000000000004s)]
*  Taking every gun from every [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=459.36s)]
*  citizen, we couldn't stop that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=461.44s)]
*  I disagree with that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  Now, Kataji Brown Jackson summarized [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=467.68s)]
*  the Trump team's argument as catch [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=470.24s)]
*  me if you can, take a look. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  The real concern, I think, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=474.72s)]
*  is that your argument seems to turn [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=476.68s)]
*  our justice system, in my view, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=479.32000000000005s)]
*  at least, into a catch me if you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=481.68s)]
*  can, and that's what we're [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  doing, at least, into a catch me [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=486.2s)]
*  if you can kind of regime from [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  the standpoint of the executive. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=490.64s)]
*  Where everybody has to have [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=492.68s)]
*  a lawyer and file a lawsuit in [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  order for the government to stop [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=496.32s)]
*  violating people's rights. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=498.4s)]
*  Justice Kagan says, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=500.0s)]
*  let's assume for the purpose of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  this, that you're wrong about [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=502.96s)]
*  the merits, that the government is [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=504.68s)]
*  not allowed to do this under [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=506.68s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  And yet it seems to me that your [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=509.48s)]
*  argument says we get to keep on [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=511.28s)]
*  doing it until everyone who is [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=513.04s)]
*  potentially harmed by it figures [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=514.96s)]
*  out how to file a lawsuit, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=517.4s)]
*  hire a lawyer, etc. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=519.32s)]
*  And I don't understand how that is [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=520.68s)]
*  remotely consistent with [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=523.48s)]
*  the rule of law. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=525.6s)]
*  And finally, all of the merits of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=527.0s)]
*  the birthright citizenship case are [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=528.92s)]
*  not technically in question here. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=531.2s)]
*  Justice Amy Coney Barrett [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=533.52s)]
*  repeatedly pressed Sauer about why [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=535.08s)]
*  the government is avoiding [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=537.16s)]
*  the merits, and he made a damning [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=538.72s)]
*  admission, take a look. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=540.6s)]
*  This is also a follow up to some of [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=542.12s)]
*  the questions that others have asked [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  you about the merits of the order [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=545.44s)]
*  not being before us. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=547.1600000000001s)]
*  Did I understand your answer to be [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=548.24s)]
*  because you think percolation is [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=549.96s)]
*  really important for this one? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=551.5200000000001s)]
*  Yes, but also more fundamentally, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=552.96s)]
*  it illustrates that the very [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=555.0s)]
*  problem with these nationwide [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=556.72s)]
*  injunctions is they force this [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=558.44s)]
*  rushed, fast and furious decisions [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=560.36s)]
*  on the merits. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  So I think it'd be very [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=564.0400000000001s)]
*  inappropriate in this case to come [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=565.44s)]
*  to a stable conclusion that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=567.36s)]
*  the government is not going to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=568.96s)]
*  In this case to come to a stay [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=570.8s)]
*  application saying, please give us [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=572.36s)]
*  a rush to a decision on the merits [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=574.4s)]
*  of something that's very, very [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=576.36s)]
*  complex. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=578.16s)]
*  But the government's done that in [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=578.84s)]
*  other cases too, right? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  Those cases would be different in [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=581.68s)]
*  this case. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=583.2s)]
*  The example I gave earlier, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=583.84s)]
*  we think it's very clear cut on [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=585.0s)]
*  the merits. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=586.4s)]
*  This one is, we can see it a novel [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=587.0s)]
*  and sensitive question. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=588.48s)]
*  So this one isn't clear cut on [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=589.52s)]
*  the merits? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=590.64s)]
*  This one, in this case, we want [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=591.24s)]
*  the court to address their [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=592.64s)]
*  remedial issue. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=593.92s)]
*  One could say in other words, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=595.04s)]
*  they can't defend it because they [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=596.84s)]
*  know it's so [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=599.2s)]
*  blatantly unconstitutional. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=599.96s)]
*  But Cenk, what do you think [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=601.72s)]
*  the court will decide here? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  Do you think we should read into [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=605.2s)]
*  Justice Coney Barrett's line [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  of questioning? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=608.76s)]
*  Okay, so I have so [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=610.2s)]
*  many things to say about all the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=611.0s)]
*  different justices in their line of [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=612.2800000000001s)]
*  questioning. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=613.76s)]
*  Because Amy Coney Barrett had [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=614.76s)]
*  the best questions to be honest. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=616.2800000000001s)]
*  That was one of them, and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=618.6800000000001s)]
*  then I'm going to get back to [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=619.76s)]
*  a second one that was even more [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  critical in a minute. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=622.24s)]
*  But so in that question right [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=623.96s)]
*  there, she's getting at, okay, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=625.8000000000001s)]
*  the birthright citizenship issue. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=628.56s)]
*  Once we get past these issues of, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=632.12s)]
*  hey, can courts do, lower courts [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=634.12s)]
*  do nationwide injunctions, should [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  they do class action lawsuits? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=637.9599999999999s)]
*  The process issues, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=639.88s)]
*  What do you think about the merits [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  of birthright citizenship? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=643.36s)]
*  And he just flat out admits, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=644.7199999999999s)]
*  yeah, that was tough on the merits. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  But that's actually what you guys [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=649.4s)]
*  are going for. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=651.12s)]
*  All the process stuff is to get to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=652.64s)]
*  the conclusion where you want to [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=654.16s)]
*  take away people's citizenship. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=655.64s)]
*  And when she asked him about that, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=657.4s)]
*  he's like, yeah, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=658.72s)]
*  I've never seen a lawyer in any [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  court, let alone the Supreme Court, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=660.84s)]
*  basically say, yeah, my case sucks. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=662.6s)]
*  He literally said his case is [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=666.04s)]
*  questionable, okay? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=667.92s)]
*  Not literally in that he didn't use [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  that word, but you heard him right [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=671.72s)]
*  there in that he was saying, yeah, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  on the merits, it's dicey. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=674.9599999999999s)]
*  So what are we doing here? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=677.9599999999999s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=678.88s)]
*  And actually one of our members is [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=679.52s)]
*  a good theory on what we're doing [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=680.8s)]
*  here. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  I'll get to that in a second. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=682.6s)]
*  Fighting for [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=683.4s)]
*  ass hash 30, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=686.04s)]
*  whatever it is [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=689.3199999999999s)]
*  that we've the permissible [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=694.64s)]
*  19006 on our jokes. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=702.24s)]
*  That what we're going to be doing [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=706.6s)]
*  is we're gonna be making [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=707.48s)]
*  sure that nobody treats us [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=708.24s)]
*  like we're priests, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=710.54s)]
*  the right legal president or [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=711.12s)]
*  nobody who's in charge. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=712.36s)]
*  But man, Republicans, right wing, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=713.64s)]
*  etc., you better be careful with [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=715.82s)]
*  this precedent. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=717.82s)]
*  Because now back to the process [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=719.08s)]
*  issue of, can the lower courts say, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=720.82s)]
*  hey, listen, you're going to create [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=722.88s)]
*  mayhem here if you start taking [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=725.04s)]
*  away citizenship before the Supreme [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=726.82s)]
*  Court, it goes up to the Supreme [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=728.98s)]
*  Court and the Supreme Court decides [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=730.74s)]
*  definitively, right? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  So hold on, that's the injunction, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=733.86s)]
*  hold on and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=736.22s)]
*  let the Supreme Court decide this. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=737.0s)]
*  And if they say yes, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=739.52s)]
*  then you could take away [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=740.42s)]
*  citizenship, right? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=741.34s)]
*  So Trump doesn't want that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=742.78s)]
*  He's like, no, I just want to start [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=744.5s)]
*  taking it away right now. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=745.62s)]
*  Kavanaugh has some good questions [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=746.98s)]
*  about that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=748.14s)]
*  But what Sotomayor is saying is if [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=748.86s)]
*  that's true, if a Democratic [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=750.74s)]
*  president comes in and he goes, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=752.54s)]
*  okay, so we can do anything we want [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=754.86s)]
*  and the lower courts can't stop us, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=757.22s)]
*  they have to wait all the way till [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=759.74s)]
*  it goes up to the Supreme Court. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=761.74s)]
*  Usually the Supreme Court remands [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=763.9399999999999s)]
*  and then goes back down to the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=765.26s)]
*  lower courts and all the way back [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=766.22s)]
*  up to the Supreme Court. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=767.54s)]
*  That could take a long, long time. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=768.8199999999999s)]
*  So her example, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=771.54s)]
*  I can give a thousand examples, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=772.3399999999999s)]
*  but her example was, all right, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=773.74s)]
*  Democrat comes in and goes, all [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=775.02s)]
*  right, I'm seizing all your guns. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=776.22s)]
*  Good luck, you'll get to the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=778.66s)]
*  Supreme Court in a year or so, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=779.78s)]
*  I suppose, but by that time, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=781.14s)]
*  I'll have all your guns. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=782.4599999999999s)]
*  And then you'll have to try to get [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=784.3399999999999s)]
*  them back, and then you'll have to [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=785.3399999999999s)]
*  go to the courts and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=786.5799999999999s)]
*  the Supreme Court and back and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=787.22s)]
*  forth, back and forth. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=788.5s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=789.6999999999999s)]
*  What if they start doing massively, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=790.9399999999999s)]
*  although this is massively [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=793.3399999999999s)]
*  unconstitutional and super clear. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=794.54s)]
*  But what if the court said, okay, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=796.5s)]
*  the president said, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=798.66s)]
*  Democrat or Republican, all right, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=799.7s)]
*  I'm taking away freedom of the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=801.3s)]
*  press, all the press is shut down [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=802.42s)]
*  immediately, okay? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=803.9s)]
*  No one is allowed to broadcast, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=805.54s)]
*  and certainly no one is allowed to [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=806.9s)]
*  criticize the president. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=808.82s)]
*  Okay, well, now lower courts can't [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=810.74s)]
*  do anything, so they're going to [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=812.58s)]
*  shut down every single media [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=814.1s)]
*  organization and then try to [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=815.46s)]
*  restart them a year later when [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=817.3s)]
*  the Supreme Court gets to it? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=818.78s)]

*  man, if I had an ally who was [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=825.06s)]

*  the bad things. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=829.74s)]
*  But I would counsel for us to take [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=830.7s)]
*  significant and massive action and [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=832.94s)]
*  let them sort it out later. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=835.3000000000001s)]
*  It can't stand, that's nuts. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=837.5400000000001s)]
*  So, Kataji Brown Jackson leads to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=839.94s)]
*  one of our members, right? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=842.1400000000001s)]
*  So why are they even doing this? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=843.94s)]
*  What's the point of this? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=846.58s)]

*  non-white citizens, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=853.1800000000001s)]

*  If you, and that's partly what [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=862.62s)]
*  Kataji Brown Jackson was getting [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=864.38s)]
*  at, if you have this rule in place, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=866.38s)]
*  how are they going to enforce it? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=868.62s)]
*  And Kavanaugh got to that, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=870.7s)]
*  I'll get to him in a second. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=871.9000000000001s)]
*  And basically, it would be [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=873.58s)]
*  the president, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=875.4200000000001s)]

*  he's been criticizing me. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=882.46s)]
*  That's it, he was born here, but [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=884.1800000000001s)]
*  his parents once went on a vacation [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=886.0600000000001s)]
*  and does that really count? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=888.1s)]
*  I don't know if one of his parents [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=890.34s)]
*  is American, but [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=891.6600000000001s)]

*  So that's part of the point here, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=905.4200000000001s)]
*  a total political attack and [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=907.3000000000001s)]
*  an attack on our constitution. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=908.94s)]

*  Kavanaugh's an interesting cat. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=913.02s)]
*  So he's the one that has this [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=915.62s)]
*  alternative about it, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=917.14s)]
*  how people can bring up class [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=918.34s)]
*  action lawsuits instead of getting [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=919.86s)]
*  an injunction from the lower [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=921.78s)]
*  courts. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=923.3s)]
*  Honestly, it makes no sense to me. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=924.5799999999999s)]
*  And Kagan was like, okay, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=926.74s)]
*  what if they say, all right, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=928.46s)]
*  we lost that class action lawsuit. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=930.18s)]
*  Yeah, those people, we can't take [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=932.5s)]
*  away their birthright citizenship, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=933.66s)]
*  but everyone else we can. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=935.02s)]
*  There's no answer to that, right? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=937.8199999999999s)]
*  So it just doesn't make any sense. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=939.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't even, it doesn't even [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=941.86s)]
*  begin to make any sense [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=943.46s)]
*  as an alternative. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=944.74s)]
*  On the other hand, Kavanaugh then [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=945.66s)]
*  was like, wait, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=947.74s)]
*  how are you going to apply this? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=948.9s)]
*  So baby gets born in a hospital, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=951.46s)]
*  gets a birth certificate. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=953.5s)]
*  You're born in America, so [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=955.9s)]
*  you say US citizen, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=956.9s)]
*  they write that in. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=957.9s)]
*  Are you guys going to go hospital [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=959.1s)]
*  to hospital? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=960.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, he was born here, but [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=960.62s)]
*  one of his parents was originally [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=963.82s)]
*  from Cambodia 17 years ago. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=966.1s)]
*  So that one doesn't count, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=968.74s)]
*  switch it to Cambodia. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=970.02s)]
*  And by the way, if the lower [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=972.54s)]
*  courts can't do the injunction, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=973.82s)]
*  they would get to do that for [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=975.58s)]
*  a bunch of people. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=977.1800000000001s)]
*  And then if the Supreme Court rules [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=978.1800000000001s)]
*  against them, they have to go back [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=980.3000000000001s)]
*  and go, okay, sorry, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=982.38s)]
*  the birth certificate, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=983.66s)]
*  not Cambodian, back to America. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=985.1800000000001s)]
*  It would be an unbelievable mess, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=987.94s)]
*  a ridiculous mess. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=990.46s)]
*  So the fact that the conservative [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=992.7s)]
*  justices are even entertaining this [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=994.58s)]
*  is basically like the Alitos and [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=996.78s)]
*  the Clarence Thomas's going, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=998.7s)]
*  Donald Trump, you can come up with [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1001.42s)]
*  the dumbest thing in the world. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1003.26s)]

*  no one will know who's an American [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1008.9s)]
*  citizen anymore. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1010.62s)]

*  When a baby is born, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1013.14s)]

*  where are the parents from? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1016.1s)]

*  that then polices this, right? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1020.42s)]
*  Or do they just assume the kid's [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1022.62s)]

*  birthright citizenship? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1076.5s)]
*  It's right in there in [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1078.34s)]
*  the 14th Amendment. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1079.26s)]
*  It's the clearest thing [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1080.54s)]
*  in the world. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1081.4599999999998s)]
*  And by the way, if you can do that, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1081.98s)]
*  then you can take away [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1083.6999999999998s)]
*  the Second Amendment, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1084.9399999999998s)]
*  which is way less clear. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1086.2199999999998s)]
*  Because it says it's contingent on [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1088.2199999999998s)]
*  a militia. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1089.82s)]
*  If we're having a conversation [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1090.54s)]
*  about a Chris LeClair amendment, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1091.9399999999998s)]
*  we'll definitely go back and [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1093.58s)]
*  have a conversation about [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1094.9399999999998s)]
*  the Second Amendment. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1096.1799999999998s)]
*  And so last thing for now, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1097.4199999999998s)]
*  on Amy Coding Barrett, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1098.98s)]
*  what I promised to Jordan. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1100.3799999999999s)]
*  So she asked, okay, wait, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1101.98s)]
*  are you guys even going to follow [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1103.9399999999998s)]
*  court orders? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1106.1399999999999s)]
*  Because we're going through this [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1107.1799999999998s)]
*  whole rigmarole here, but [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1109.34s)]
*  you keep saying in public that [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1111.1s)]
*  you might not. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1113.02s)]
*  So she said if the Second Circuit [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1114.1s)]
*  issues a ruling, will the Trump [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1116.58s)]
*  administration follow it? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1118.3799999999999s)]
*  And Sauer says, general practice [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1120.02s)]
*  is to respect those precedents, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1122.3s)]
*  but there are circumstances when it [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1124.3799999999999s)]
*  is not a categorical practice, and [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1126.58s)]
*  that is not just a new policy. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1128.78s)]
*  She said, whoa, whoa, whoa, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1131.5s)]
*  wait a minute. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1132.5s)]
*  So what do you mean it's not [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1133.58s)]
*  general practice to follow what [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1135.1399999999999s)]
*  the district courts are saying? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1136.9399999999998s)]
*  He's like, well, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1139.1399999999999s)]
*  it's general practice, but [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1140.1s)]
*  we don't have to do it. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1141.6999999999998s)]
*  She's like, no, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1143.02s)]
*  you kind of do have to do it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1144.06s)]
*  And then he keeps saying not [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1146.22s)]
*  necessarily, and she's like, wait, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1147.94s)]
*  you say that there's been long [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1150.46s)]
*  standing exceptions to following [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1152.26s)]
*  the courts, can you name any other [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1154.3s)]
*  than the Trump administration? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1156.26s)]
*  He said, well, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1158.3799999999999s)]
*  it's long standing. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1159.3799999999999s)]
*  No, in other words, no, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1160.94s)]
*  he can't, because it's not a thing. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1161.7s)]
*  They're just making it up that you [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1163.7s)]
*  don't have to listen to the courts. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1164.7s)]
*  And then finally she presses them [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1166.18s)]
*  all the way on the distinction [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1167.34s)]
*  between the Supreme Court and [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1168.78s)]
*  the lower courts. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1169.82s)]
*  And he goes, no, no, no, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1170.3799999999999s)]
*  we're clear we will follow [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1171.7s)]
*  the Supreme Court rules. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1173.34s)]
*  Well, he's on the record. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1175.74s)]
*  I don't know if it's worth anything [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1176.6599999999999s)]
*  that he's on the record, but [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1177.6599999999999s)]
*  at least that's good news, right? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1178.62s)]
*  But on the lower courts, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1180.86s)]
*  he's super clear. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1181.82s)]
*  No, if it's not the Supreme Court, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1182.86s)]
*  we can choose to ignore it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1184.98s)]
*  And that's a disaster. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1187.02s)]
*  And again, if Republicans can do [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1188.58s)]
*  it, so can Democrats. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1190.58s)]
*  We're going to have mayhem and [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1192.54s)]
*  chaos if they win. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1193.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that just completely [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1197.18s)]
*  undermines and [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1200.22s)]
*  jeopardizes our entire democracy. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1201.26s)]
*  That is a very serious next step, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1204.3s)]
*  if they are willing to take it that [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1206.6999999999998s)]
*  far, but I wouldn't put it past them. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1209.2199999999998s)]
*  On who would side on which side of [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1211.6999999999998s)]
*  the case, I think we've seen data [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1213.4199999999998s)]
*  over the past couple of years that [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1215.3s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett has surprisingly [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1217.1399999999999s)]
*  sided with liberals the most. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1219.06s)]
*  Which is interesting when you think [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1220.54s)]
*  about the context surrounding her [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1222.1799999999998s)]
*  nomination to begin with. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1223.78s)]
*  People thought she was going to be [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1225.02s)]
*  this extreme far right, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1226.82s)]
*  draconian justice steeped in [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1228.26s)]
*  a real patriarchal understanding and [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1230.06s)]
*  religious overtones of the country. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1232.74s)]
*  And she's surprisingly been way more [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1235.5400000000002s)]
*  moderate than people expected. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1237.8200000000002s)]
*  Kavanaugh too, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1240.2600000000002s)]
*  I think Kavanaugh of [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1240.98s)]
*  the conservatives, Kavanaugh [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1242.0200000000002s)]
*  sided with the liberals second most. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1243.3000000000002s)]
*  So I'm with you, if it's seven to [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1244.74s)]
*  two and it's Thomas and Alito would [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1246.8600000000001s)]
*  not be a surprising outcome, but [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1249.22s)]
*  it is hard to look at what the [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1251.38s)]
*  government is arguing here, what [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1253.1000000000001s)]
*  the Solicitor General is arguing [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1255.1000000000001s)]
*  here and think that any of them [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1257.14s)]
*  could think, yeah, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1259.0600000000002s)]
*  that's a sound argument. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1260.5s)]
*  Thomas and Alito who would find a [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1262.3s)]
*  way to justify it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1264.1s)]
*  On the issue itself though, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1265.34s)]
*  I think like we laid out, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1266.86s)]
*  it is perfectly clear in [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1268.22s)]
*  the 14th Amendment. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1269.46s)]
*  And I also, I'm disheartened by [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1270.74s)]
*  this effort to begin with, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1273.1399999999999s)]
*  because to me it runs contrary to [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1275.22s)]
*  what this country should be. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1277.74s)]
*  Many of us grew up to see this [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1279.82s)]
*  country as the shining [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1281.98s)]
*  beacon on a hill, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1283.62s)]
*  a place of opportunity for anyone [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1285.02s)]
*  around the world who wants to come [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1287.58s)]
*  and make something of themselves, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1291.06s)]
*  contribute to this project, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1293.42s)]
*  contribute to the country. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1295.58s)]

*  the clock and rewriting this [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1299.66s)]
*  country into something that is [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1301.74s)]
*  isolated, hateful, bigoted, lonely, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1304.06s)]
*  disconnected from the rest of [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1307.18s)]
*  the world and that's a sad place to [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1309.42s)]
*  be. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1312.1s)]
*  I really fear for our country in [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1313.3799999999999s)]
*  the direction we are heading if [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1315.46s)]
*  policies like this are so [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1317.82s)]
*  successfully enacted, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1320.1799999999998s)]
*  the long term effects would be [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1321.74s)]
*  devastating and it's rooted in [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1323.6599999999999s)]
*  an inhumane view of others, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1325.96s)]

*  why might go in this direction? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1343.1399999999999s)]
*  Who asked for this? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1346.22s)]
*  So did the people who voted for [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1348.02s)]
*  Biden but then switched their votes [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1349.74s)]

*  inflation, they were worried about [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1361.74s)]

*  Before we get to that, Cenk. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1567.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's a huge [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1570.3799999999999s)]
*  caveat there. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1571.46s)]
*  There's actually three different [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1572.26s)]
*  options for what they could do with [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1573.98s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1575.7s)]
*  One's a disaster, one is fantastic. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1576.22s)]
*  And then the third one is [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1579.82s)]
*  frustrating and will not get to [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1581.22s)]
*  the right result. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1583.1s)]
*  I'm afraid they're going to do [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1584.22s)]
*  the third one. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1585.3s)]
*  But after Jordan gives you all [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1585.94s)]
*  the details here and my God, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1587.62s)]
*  the genocide here is unreal now. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1589.42s)]
*  72 days of starvation, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1591.7s)]
*  so we're all going to do anything. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1593.58s)]
*  It's the cruelty of this current [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1596.46s)]
*  Israeli government is unbearable. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1599.02s)]
*  And so those three options are [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1602.7s)]
*  going to determine everything. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1605.06s)]
*  And which way does Trump go? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1608.46s)]
*  And Trump's going to decide this [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1610.66s)]
*  thing, not Netanyahu, Trump is. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1612.18s)]
*  And he's a giant wild card. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1614.18s)]
*  So let's tell you about the current [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1616.54s)]
*  state of the disaster in Gaza. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1618.94s)]
*  And it's as bad as it has ever been. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1621.18s)]
*  And then let's talk about is it [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1624.78s)]
*  going to get better or worse? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1626.22s)]
*  And like I said, don't lose hope, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1627.82s)]
*  because there is one alternative [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1629.46s)]
*  where this thing turns positive in [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1631.1399999999999s)]
*  a totally unexpected way. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1632.82s)]
*  Now Donald Trump's messaging on [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1636.34s)]
*  what his intentions are for [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1638.06s)]
*  Gaza have been all over the place. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1639.4599999999998s)]
*  But during a meeting with [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1641.6599999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu in April, he said this. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1642.86s)]
*  Having a peace force like [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1646.1s)]
*  the United States there, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1647.4599999999998s)]
*  controlling and [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1648.98s)]
*  owning the Gaza Strip would be [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1650.02s)]
*  a good thing. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1651.86s)]
*  Because right now all it is is for [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1652.74s)]
*  years and years, all I hear about [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1654.58s)]
*  is killing and Hamas and problems. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1656.58s)]
*  And if you take the people, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1659.5s)]
*  the Palestinians, and move them [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1660.9399999999998s)]
*  around to different countries, and [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1662.54s)]
*  you have plenty of countries that [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1664.4199999999998s)]
*  will do that, and you really have [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1666.1399999999999s)]
*  a freedom zone. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1668.1399999999999s)]
*  You call it the freedom zone, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1669.06s)]
*  a free zone, a zone where people [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1671.02s)]
*  aren't going to be killed every [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1673.02s)]
*  day, that's a hell of a place. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1674.82s)]
*  It's a, you know what I call it, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1677.74s)]
*  a great location that nobody wants [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1679.1799999999998s)]
*  to live in. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1680.9399999999998s)]
*  And yesterday he doubled down. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1684.58s)]
*  During a meeting with business [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1686.3799999999999s)]
*  in Qatar, he told the press, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1687.82s)]
*  Gaza has been a territory of death [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1689.7s)]
*  and destruction for many years. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1691.8999999999999s)]
*  I have concepts for Gaza, and [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1694.46s)]
*  I think are very good. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1696.66s)]
*  Make it a freedom zone. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1699.22s)]
*  Let the United States get involved [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1700.94s)]
*  and make it just a freedom zone. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1703.1s)]
*  I'd be proud to have the United [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1705.62s)]
*  States have it, take it, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1707.26s)]
*  make it a freedom zone. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1708.7s)]
*  He described aerial images he's [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1711.06s)]
*  seen of the widespread destruction [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1713.06s)]
*  from Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1715.34s)]
*  And said, there's practically no [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1717.8999999999999s)]
*  building standing. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1720.06s)]
*  It's not like you're trying to save [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1721.34s)]
*  something. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1723.5s)]
*  His comments come as the death toll [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1724.02s)]
*  surpasses 53,000, and [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1726.66s)]
*  that is just an estimate. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1728.5s)]
*  And the Israeli military is [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1731.22s)]
*  intensifying operations across [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1732.86s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1734.94s)]
*  They killed more than 100 people [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1735.66s)]
*  just today and are pledging to [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1737.66s)]
*  continue the bombings. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1739.5s)]
*  And now Netanyahu is just outright [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1741.46s)]
*  saying that his goal is to drive [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1743.5s)]
*  the Palestinians out. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1745.34s)]
*  He said this earlier this week, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1747.22s)]
*  we are destroying more and [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1749.6200000000001s)]
*  more homes they have nowhere to [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1751.58s)]
*  return to the only inevitable [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1754.06s)]
*  outcome will be the desire of [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1756.22s)]
*  Gazans to emigrate outside of [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1758.44s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1760.74s)]
*  Cenk, you hear Netanyahu's intent, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1762.94s)]
*  just completely destroy it, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1765.7s)]
*  drive everyone out. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1767.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know how I could look at [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1770.5s)]
*  Trump's freedom zone proposal and [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1772.18s)]
*  find any room for encouragement. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1774.18s)]
*  So what are we missing here? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1776.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, first of all, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1778.6200000000001s)]
*  let me discourage you further and [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1779.7s)]
*  then I'll get to the encouragement. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1781.14s)]
*  Okay, so option number one is we do [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1782.5800000000002s)]
*  what Israel orders us to do, which [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1785.18s)]
*  is Americans go in there and [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1787.7s)]
*  push the Palestinians out. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1789.78s)]
*  That's the original Netanyahu plan. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1792.46s)]
*  So God forbid an Israeli should get [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1794.7s)]
*  hurt doing the ethnic cleansing. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1796.66s)]
*  And he was trying to hey, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1799.0600000000002s)]
*  he's like, hey, Miriam gave you all [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1800.26s)]
*  this money over $300 million. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1801.98s)]
*  Now you pay us back by Americans [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1803.7s)]
*  dying and being guilty of the [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1806.02s)]
*  genocide and the ethnic cleansing. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1807.8799999999999s)]
*  And then the two places that they [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1810.74s)]
*  would push them to is either [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1812.74s)]
*  the ruins of Rafa or completely out [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1814.46s)]
*  of Gaza into other countries. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1816.62s)]
*  Now if you think that that's [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1819.34s)]
*  hyperbole, they're not really [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1820.62s)]
*  going to, I mean, that's literally [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1822.02s)]
*  the textbook definition of ethnic [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1823.62s)]
*  cleansing. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1825.02s)]
*  Yeah, so let me share with you [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1825.54s)]
*  reporting from DropSite News, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1827.1s)]
*  Jeremy Scahill reporting here. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1828.74s)]
*  That shows you that is definitively [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1830.78s)]
*  what they're planning to do. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1832.22s)]
*  And in fact, they actually say it [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1833.3s)]
*  and brag about it. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1835.26s)]
*  And then I'll get you to the two [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1836.66s)]
*  other options. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1838.1s)]
*  Okay, Scahill reports Hamas will [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1838.86s)]
*  lay down its weapons, its leaders. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1841.14s)]
*  This is a Netanyahu statement to [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1843.78s)]
*  his cabinet. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1846.3s)]
*  Hamas will lay down its weapons, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1848.62s)]
*  its leaders will be allowed to [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1850.1s)]
*  leave. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1851.3s)]
*  We will see to the general [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1852.02s)]
*  security in the Gaza Strip, and [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1853.06s)]
*  will allow the realization of [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1854.62s)]
*  the Trump plan for [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1856.1s)]
*  voluntary migration. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1857.06s)]
*  He told his cabinet, referring to [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1859.06s)]
*  Trump's threat to seize Gaza and [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1860.82s)]
*  remove Palestinians from their land. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1862.46s)]
*  And he said, quote, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1865.06s)]
*  this is the plan, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1866.4199999999998s)]
*  we are not hiding this. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1867.6599999999999s)]
*  So they first say, look, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1869.8999999999999s)]
*  we want the hostages back, wink. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1871.8999999999999s)]
*  Our own envoy, Steve Witkoff, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1875.6599999999999s)]
*  said no, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1877.5s)]
*  they don't want the hostages back. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1878.1399999999999s)]
*  Israel is delaying peace. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1880.54s)]
*  They're the ones who want to [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1882.6599999999999s)]
*  continue the war, okay? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1883.6999999999998s)]
*  So he says, yeah, well, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1885.34s)]
*  we want the hostages back, but [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1886.8999999999999s)]
*  that's not good enough. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1888.78s)]
*  We also want everyone in Hamas, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1890.4599999999998s)]
*  who we don't know who they are, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1892.5s)]
*  to come out somehow and surrender. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1894.58s)]
*  And presumably they'll be either [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1897.7s)]
*  sent to prison or executed. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1899.3s)]
*  And so they're going to all [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1901.3s)]
*  voluntarily do that. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1902.3s)]
*  And then Israel is going to say, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1903.74s)]
*  okay, we are satisfied enough that [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1905.5s)]
*  all of Hamas has come out and [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1907.5s)]
*  said this. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1909.06s)]
*  And Palestine will never be allowed [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1910.06s)]
*  to exist as a state, and [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1912.82s)]
*  we will occupy Gaza. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1914.58s)]
*  So if Hamas agrees to all of that, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1917.18s)]
*  then we can get to a peace deal. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1919.46s)]
*  Who would agree to a permanent [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1922.42s)]
*  occupation and give away their land? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1923.98s)]
*  By definition, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1926.14s)]
*  that is not at all possible. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=1927.18s)]

*  Okay, last quote here from [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2204.7799999999997s)]
*  Skahil at Dropside News. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2206.22s)]
*  Nanny Yahu added that Israel had [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2208.18s)]
*  set up a mechanism to coordinate [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2209.8199999999997s)]
*  the removal of Palestinians from [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2211.3799999999997s)]
*  Gaza, saying, quote, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2212.8599999999997s)]
*  the main issue is this, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2214.18s)]
*  we need host countries where we [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2215.62s)]
*  have other countries willing to [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2217.38s)]
*  absorb them. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2219.1800000000003s)]
*  That's what we're working on right [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2219.82s)]
*  now. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2221.6600000000003s)]
*  So in other words, we're going to [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2222.26s)]
*  drive them all out of Gaza and [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2224.2200000000003s)]
*  we're going to push them even into [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2225.9s)]
*  the Sinai Desert or whichever other [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2227.9s)]

*  them. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2232.02s)]
*  And we're just going to steal all [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2232.54s)]
*  of their land in Gaza. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2234.9s)]
*  And yes, it is stealing. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2236.78s)]
*  It is definitely stealing the land. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2238.6600000000003s)]
*  And then, and who cares? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2242.58s)]
*  Yeah, kill them, kill them, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2244.7000000000003s)]
*  drive them out, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2246.54s)]
*  ethnically cleanse them. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2247.5s)]
*  This is genocide 101. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2249.06s)]
*  So now, Rashida Tlaib, before, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2250.86s)]
*  if she had said genocide, apartheid, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2252.7s)]
*  ethnic cleansing, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2254.94s)]
*  she would have been sanctioned. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2256.02s)]
*  They would have said, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2258.02s)]
*  that is terrible anti-Semitism. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2259.22s)]
*  You're not allowed to say things [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2261.46s)]
*  that are true about Israel, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2262.94s)]
*  sanctioned, sanctioned, right? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2264.18s)]
*  But she wasn't sanctioned, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2266.26s)]
*  that's interesting. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2267.34s)]
*  Why? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2268.38s)]
*  Well, a couple things have happened. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2269.82s)]
*  Number one, now the genocide is [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2271.14s)]
*  utterly indisputable. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2272.82s)]
*  If you're disputing that it's [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2274.3s)]
*  a genocide, okay, I mean, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2275.74s)]
*  you could dispute that the sky is [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2277.14s)]
*  blue and the grass is green, but [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2278.8199999999997s)]
*  you sound like a lunatic. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2280.4599999999996s)]
*  I mean, if this isn't a genocide, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2282.3399999999997s)]
*  what the hell is? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2284.02s)]
*  They're declaring it. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2286.2599999999998s)]
*  They're like saying, yeah, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2287.5s)]
*  we will drive them all out. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2288.8599999999997s)]
*  And we'll kill as many as we need [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2290.4199999999996s)]
*  to to take their land. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2292.14s)]
*  How much clearer does it have to [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2293.9799999999996s)]
*  be? Okay, so [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2295.2999999999997s)]
*  one is that it's indisputable. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2295.8599999999997s)]
*  It doesn't matter, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2297.3799999999997s)]
*  Congress totally works for Israel. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2298.2599999999998s)]
*  Anyway, they can dispute [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2300.5s)]
*  the indisputable. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2301.2999999999997s)]
*  But one of the reasons she's not [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2301.9399999999996s)]
*  being sanctioned is because [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2303.2999999999997s)]
*  the right wing is starting to swing. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2304.82s)]
*  And the Tucker Carlson and so [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2307.06s)]
*  many others, Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2308.86s)]
*  she came on the show and said, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2311.1800000000003s)]
*  we shouldn't give any more money [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2312.9s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2314.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure I've ever heard [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2315.1800000000003s)]
*  a Republican politician in my [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2316.98s)]
*  lifetime say that. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2319.06s)]
*  Tom Massey, I suppose, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2320.86s)]
*  probably said that. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2322.3s)]
*  But outside of that, I mean, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2323.82s)]
*  they worked 100% for [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2326.1000000000004s)]
*  the state of Israel, not for us. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2327.9s)]
*  So now all of a sudden, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2331.2200000000003s)]
*  their media is changing. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2333.6600000000003s)]
*  Some of their politicians are [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2335.3s)]
*  changing. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2336.5s)]
*  So all of a sudden, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2337.3s)]
*  she's not sanctioned. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2338.06s)]
*  Israel's beginning to lose [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2339.3s)]
*  some power. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2340.14s)]
*  So that brings us to option number [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2341.06s)]
*  two. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2342.34s)]
*  Trump went and [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2343.94s)]
*  talked to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2344.46s)]
*  That was just what this tour was [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2346.86s)]
*  about. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2347.98s)]
*  But he left Israel out, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2348.62s)]
*  which is already stunning. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2349.7400000000002s)]
*  Usually you go to Israel, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2351.3s)]
*  you kiss the ring of Netanyahu or [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2352.78s)]
*  whoever is the Israeli prime [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2354.3s)]
*  minister. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2355.42s)]
*  And then you go, Israel is [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2356.38s)]
*  the greatest thing that's ever [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2357.1800000000003s)]
*  been created. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2358.06s)]
*  Then you go to the Arab countries [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2358.62s)]
*  and you give a generally insulting [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2360.1s)]
*  speech publicly. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2361.5s)]
*  And then you do some begrudging [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2362.5s)]
*  deal with them, okay? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2363.78s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2365.34s)]
*  you're going to do a deal because [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2366.14s)]
*  they got a lot of money, okay? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2366.98s)]
*  But Trump has totally flipped that. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2367.86s)]
*  So he doesn't go to Israel, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2369.82s)]
*  he goes to the Arab countries. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2371.1s)]
*  Then he goes and [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2372.5s)]
*  starts taking money from them, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2373.78s)]
*  right? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2375.7s)]
*  And so number one, he's got [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2376.2s)]
*  the $400 million jet from Qatar, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2377.82s)]
*  that's going to be Air Force One. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2379.78s)]
*  Number two, he's got several [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2381.46s)]
*  billion dollar deals he's doing [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2382.7s)]
*  with Qatar and some of the other [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2383.94s)]
*  countries, including Saudi Arabia. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2385.34s)]
*  So he's just personally benefiting. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2387.3s)]
*  So he's like, you know Trump? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2388.66s)]
*  He's like, wait, I want to be known [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2390.94s)]
*  for peace and these guys are giving [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2392.98s)]
*  me billions of dollars. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2394.8999999999996s)]
*  Where's the question? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2396.66s)]
*  But wait, the Aidos gave you over [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2397.7799999999997s)]
*  300 million. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2399.46s)]
*  He's like, yeah, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2400.22s)]
*  that was yesterday. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2401.06s)]
*  And if you don't know that I stiff [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2402.2599999999998s)]
*  investors, you're a bit of an idiot. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2404.02s)]
*  So that's why Netanyahu and [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2406.7799999999997s)]
*  Trump won, he came in like, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2408.1s)]
*  I own you, I own you, right? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2409.58s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2414.1s)]
*  Trump starts defying me. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2415.14s)]
*  He's like, wait, what happened? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2416.1s)]
*  What happened? I thought we [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2418.58s)]
*  purchased you. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2419.2999999999997s)]
*  That was yesterday, brother. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2420.1s)]
*  Trump never ever cares about his [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2422.5s)]
*  investors, he always screws them. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2425.18s)]
*  So now he's like, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2428.22s)]
*  the Arabs are offering me more [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2429.42s)]
*  money. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2431.02s)]
*  I guess that's a sad day for you. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2432.14s)]
*  So now when he brought our freedom [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2434.1s)]
*  zone Jordan was in the context of [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2435.62s)]
*  those speeches and [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2437.18s)]
*  the context of those deals. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2438.06s)]
*  And by the way, the other thing is [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2439.46s)]
*  he got $142 billion arms deal with [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2441.5s)]
*  the Saudis. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2443.86s)]
*  So I don't know that we should be [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2445.54s)]
*  giving the Saudis and [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2447.22s)]
*  these dictatorships in the Gulf. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2448.22s)]
*  All of these weapons, but we are, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2450.62s)]
*  and our defense contractors are [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2452.3399999999997s)]
*  going to make a killing from it. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2453.8199999999997s)]
*  And by the way, Jordan, that's [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2455.66s)]
*  another huge part of the puzzle. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2456.8199999999997s)]
*  It's not just Trump. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2457.7799999999997s)]
*  Part of the reason why we support [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2459.02s)]
*  Israel so much is, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2460.38s)]
*  they had the conspiracy theories [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2461.14s)]
*  about all the Jews around [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2462.62s)]
*  everything. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2463.66s)]
*  No, no, no, no, there's also huge [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2464.2999999999997s)]
*  Christian Zionist voting block. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2466.02s)]
*  But even more important is [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2467.94s)]
*  the military industrial complex. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2469.22s)]
*  So they're like, America's going to [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2471.3399999999997s)]
*  pass all these bills that give 20 [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2473.22s)]
*  billion to Israel, but really it's [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2475.02s)]
*  so that Israel can buy our weapons [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2477.1s)]
*  so it's going to the defense [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2479.38s)]
*  contractors, then Israel is getting [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2480.94s)]
*  those weapons, right? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2482.98s)]
*  So Israel's super happy, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2484.78s)]
*  the defense contractors are super [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2486.06s)]
*  happy, and they don't want that [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2487.78s)]
*  gravy train to end. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2489.3s)]
*  But now Trump comes in and goes, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2490.78s)]
*  I got a better gravy train. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2492.06s)]
*  We're going to arm the Arabs to [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2493.58s)]
*  the teeth, okay? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2496.06s)]
*  You guys are going to make [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2497.58s)]
*  a killing. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2498.42s)]
*  Before you're making tens of [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2499.74s)]
*  billions, now you're going to make [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2500.82s)]
*  hundreds of billions. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2501.66s)]
*  All of a sudden, Rafe on Lockheed [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2502.9s)]
*  Martin, etc. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2504.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, you know what? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2504.78s)]
*  Israel's kind of optional. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2506.86s)]
*  All of a sudden, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2508.38s)]
*  Israel's optional, right? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2508.94s)]
*  And so when he talked about [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2510.62s)]
*  freedom zone in that context, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2511.98s)]
*  the second plan is the US goes in, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2513.7000000000003s)]
*  but we go in with Arab countries. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2515.94s)]
*  And the Arab countries then run it [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2518.3s)]
*  so that Hamas doesn't and [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2520.46s)]
*  the Palestinian authority doesn't. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2522.02s)]
*  And that leads to an independent [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2524.2200000000003s)]
*  Palestinian state. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2526.42s)]
*  That would be amazing. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2527.9s)]
*  And there's no reason not to do [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2530.2200000000003s)]
*  that, none, none, none. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2532.82s)]
*  And by the way, if you're [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2535.38s)]
*  none, and by the way, if he does [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2537.1s)]
*  that, they'll build statues of him [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2538.86s)]
*  all over the Middle East. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2540.98s)]
*  And overnight, the entire Middle [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2542.98s)]
*  East will turn into our allies. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2544.86s)]
*  And he'll win the Nobel Peace [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2547.58s)]
*  Prize. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2548.78s)]
*  Those are, I'm not kidding and [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2549.3s)]
*  I'm not exaggerating. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2550.7s)]
*  If he created it, got actual peace [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2552.06s)]
*  in the Middle East and created [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2553.7s)]
*  an independent Palestinian state, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2555.3s)]
*  guaranteed Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2557.26s)]
*  Where's the downside? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2559.94s)]
*  The Israeli lobby won't give you [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2561.7400000000002s)]
*  money anymore. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2563.26s)]
*  He's not going to run anyway. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2564.26s)]
*  There's no downside at all. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2565.9399999999996s)]
*  Okay, the third option, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2568.02s)]
*  unfortunately, sounds halfway okay [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2569.5s)]
*  but is disastrous. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2571.8999999999996s)]
*  Third option is, they say there's [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2574.14s)]
*  a peace deal, you get the hostages [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2575.98s)]
*  back, that's good. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2577.62s)]
*  Israel doesn't occupy, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2578.9399999999996s)]
*  the US occupies bad. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2580.66s)]
*  And eventually, there's loose talk [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2582.98s)]
*  of a Palestinian state at an [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2585.06s)]
*  undetermined time. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2586.58s)]
*  And whether they'll ever be [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2587.8999999999996s)]
*  actually have sovereignty in their [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2589.5s)]

*  In which case, Netanyahu is going [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2593.82s)]
*  to find 8,000 ways to destroy that [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2595.6200000000003s)]
*  deal. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2597.54s)]
*  It'll never happen, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2598.54s)]
*  they'll just wait Trump out. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2599.42s)]
*  And the next establishment [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2600.9s)]
*  politician will do whatever Israel [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2602.26s)]
*  commands. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2604.1000000000004s)]
*  So it's got to be option number two. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2604.6600000000003s)]
*  Jordan, the fact that option two [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2607.6200000000003s)]

*  No, I have zero hope that Trump [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2618.86s)]

*  what we saw telegraphed by Netanyahu [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2642.58s)]

*  it. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2651.82s)]

*  And that's why so [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2657.7400000000002s)]
*  many people spoke up and so [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2658.46s)]

*  this is the thing that Ana [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2954.18s)]

*  No, everybody has to retract [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2963.22s)]
*  the story. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2964.7s)]
*  Israel is the most moral country in [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2965.66s)]
*  the history of the world. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2967.14s)]

*  if you say they would ever hit [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2969.54s)]
*  a hospital, anti-Semite, right? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2970.9s)]
*  What happened? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2973.8199999999997s)]
*  They destroyed all the hospitals [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2974.3399999999997s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2975.74s)]
*  They leveled two of them yesterday. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2976.54s)]
*  So now we're past 53,000 dead. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2979.06s)]
*  They've taken two thirds of Gaza [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2983.06s)]
*  already. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2984.54s)]
*  So where is the, okay, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2985.46s)]
*  they would never hit any hospital. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2986.86s)]
*  They hit every hospital and [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2988.98s)]
*  every university and [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2990.38s)]

*  all. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2993.46s)]
*  So can I get a confession from [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2993.98s)]
*  the supporters of Israel? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2995.42s)]
*  You were wrong. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2997.14s)]
*  Israel, this current government is [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=2998.46s)]
*  a bunch of savages and [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3001.26s)]

*  Israel, can you imagine if Hamas [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3008.98s)]

*  you Jordan on you, so they have to [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3026.98s)]

*  perfectly rational Turks, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3035.62s)]
*  perfectly progressive Turks. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3036.98s)]
*  And you ask them about Kurds, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3038.98s)]
*  boom, gone. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3040.34s)]
*  Bias comes in, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3041.38s)]
*  their eyes glaze over. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3042.2599999999998s)]
*  No, the Kurds are bad. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3043.58s)]
*  Turks are the greatest. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3045.1s)]

*  No, bias will blind you to anything [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3049.14s)]
*  when it comes to these kind [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3051.74s)]
*  of issues. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3053.7s)]
*  But I am curious, now that Netanyahu [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3054.58s)]
*  is launching this conquest [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3057.7799999999997s)]
*  imminently, and he's saying, yes, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3060.18s)]
*  this is our plan. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3063.06s)]

*  the Palestinian land. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3065.3s)]
*  We are going to continue to murder [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3066.5s)]
*  them, and we are going to drive [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3068.38s)]
*  them out. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3070.1s)]
*  Are you still going to hide behind [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3071.5s)]
*  excuses? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3073.46s)]

*  And go, yeah, no, as long as [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3077.14s)]
*  Israel's the one doing [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3078.7799999999997s)]
*  the ethnic cleansing, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3079.98s)]
*  then I'm okay with it. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3081.22s)]
*  Because excuse number one, two, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3082.9s)]
*  and three, and every excuse has to [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3084.46s)]
*  do with how Palestinians are [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3086.1800000000003s)]
*  savages and violent and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3087.7400000000002s)]
*  can't be trusted and have to be [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3089.1s)]
*  murdered because they're the [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3090.9s)]
*  violent ones, right? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3092.78s)]
*  And then finally, Jordan, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3094.3s)]
*  this idea like, don't trust Trump. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3096.98s)]
*  He'll never ever do the right [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3100.6600000000003s)]
*  thing because he doesn't have good [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3103.06s)]
*  intent and he's not actually [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3105.98s)]
*  a peacemaker. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3108.86s)]
*  Of course, of course, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3110.8199999999997s)]
*  it isn't about good intent. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3112.3399999999997s)]
*  And all of a sudden, you're like, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3114.4199999999996s)]
*  I think maybe Donald Trump's heart [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3116.3399999999997s)]
*  opened up. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3118.1s)]
*  No, no, the only reason he might [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3119.1s)]
*  do it is because of corruption and [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3121.3799999999997s)]
*  ego. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3123.66s)]
*  If he thought they're going to [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3125.4599999999996s)]
*  build statues of him all over [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3126.4599999999996s)]
*  the world and he was going to get [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3127.58s)]
*  a Nobel Peace Prize, and he was [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3128.8199999999997s)]
*  going to get to take home [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3130.22s)]
*  a couple of billion dollars, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3131.3399999999997s)]
*  that's why he would do it. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3133.1s)]
*  It's not complicated and [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3134.8599999999997s)]
*  Trump's not a complicated guy. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3135.9799999999996s)]
*  Nevertheless, it is way less [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3137.66s)]
*  likely because still Israel has [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3139.82s)]
*  an enormous amount of power in this [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3142.02s)]
*  country and they are now exercising [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3144.1000000000004s)]
*  it in 8,000 different ways. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3146.26s)]
*  And so that's why I went on [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3148.38s)]
*  the Qatar jet. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3151.34s)]
*  My God, every ally of Israel is, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3154.38s)]
*  and again, the jet's wrong, right? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3156.6600000000003s)]
*  But every ally of Israel is out all [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3159.3s)]

*  in danger? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3178.7400000000002s)]

*  you'll be a hero. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3231.98s)]

*  I mean, going back to the Gulf days [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3291.06s)]
*  if you want to be accurate, but [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3293.1s)]
*  largely from the war on terror on, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3295.02s)]
*  it is a jingoistic foreign policy [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3297.2599999999998s)]
*  and that's going to extend to [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3299.5s)]
*  Palestinians as well. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3301.4199999999996s)]

*  The reason he's taking that [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3323.18s)]

*  No, Jordan, I'm being serious. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3329.98s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3330.7s)]

*  that's our speculation, okay, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3333.42s)]
*  that's terrible and I'm going to [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3336.14s)]
*  deal with that later. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3338.3399999999997s)]

*  Okay, here's why. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3411.58s)]
*  Because the people who are saying [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3413.1s)]
*  that, yes, including you, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3414.8599999999997s)]

*  Let me explain. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3418.2599999999998s)]
*  So Tucker Carlson said we [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3419.46s)]
*  shouldn't go into Iraq after he [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3420.7799999999997s)]
*  originally was in favor of it. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3422.54s)]
*  But after the war started, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3424.7s)]
*  he said we shouldn't be there, and [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3426.14s)]
*  I don't want to deal with these [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3428.14s)]
*  monkeys. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3429.7s)]
*  Now he's talking about Muslims, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3430.66s)]
*  that's my people, okay? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3431.98s)]
*  So am I in favor of that? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3433.2599999999998s)]
*  No, no, absolutely not. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3434.8599999999997s)]
*  So I could choose to do one of two [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3437.06s)]
*  things, if we were back in that [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3438.54s)]
*  time. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3440.06s)]
*  I could either encourage the Tucker [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3440.9399999999996s)]
*  Carlson wing of the party to get [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3442.5s)]

*  Here's the thing. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3744.5s)]
*  What? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3745.1400000000003s)]
*  First of all, kind of catchy. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3746.06s)]
*  Well, that's the problem with it. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3747.94s)]
*  Well, Kanye West's anti-Semitic [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3751.86s)]
*  song, Pile Hitler, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3754.1400000000003s)]
*  has been banned from major music [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3755.5s)]
*  streaming platforms. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3757.46s)]
*  It does remain available on [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3758.6200000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk's X. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3760.38s)]
*  That prompted Joe Rogan and [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3762.3s)]
*  comedian Tom Segura, who we showed [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3763.86s)]
*  you at the top, to debate whether [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3765.9s)]
*  this is the right move. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3767.74s)]
*  Here's more. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3769.58s)]
*  The f***ing song has so [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3771.62s)]
*  many millions of hits. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3772.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3773.8999999999996s)]
*  On Twitter, it's been banned from [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3774.4199999999996s)]
*  every platform. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3775.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3776.58s)]
*  But is it good to ban things from [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3777.18s)]
*  platforms, or is it better to let [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3779.18s)]
*  it be out there and [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3781.3799999999997s)]
*  let people talk about it? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3782.58s)]
*  Because if you ban it, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3784.5s)]
*  then people want to hear it more. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3785.62s)]
*  That's true. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3787.3399999999997s)]
*  And then it becomes more popular, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3787.9399999999996s)]
*  and then it kind of supports what [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3789.66s)]
*  he says, which is that there's [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3791.2599999999998s)]
*  this concerted effort, if you talk [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3792.8599999999997s)]
*  about Jewish people, that they're [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3794.8599999999997s)]
*  going to remove you from [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3796.9s)]
*  everything, remove you from [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3797.98s)]
*  banking, which is what he's saying, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3798.94s)]
*  they run everything. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3800.7000000000003s)]
*  So if they didn't, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3801.82s)]
*  if it was just you were talking [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3803.02s)]
*  about Puerto Ricans, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3804.7000000000003s)]
*  look what happened to Tony, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3805.9s)]
*  nothing, he's doing great. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3807.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3808.94s)]
*  If there's certain people that [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3809.7400000000002s)]
*  you're allowed to pick on and [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3811.9s)]
*  make jokes about or mock or [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3813.9s)]
*  say something, and [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3815.9s)]
*  you can get away with it. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3817.34s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think he's made his [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3819.1400000000003s)]
*  point, I think we all get it now. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3821.1400000000003s)]
*  And the song has racked up nearly [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3823.58s)]
*  10 million views just on Kanye's [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3825.58s)]

*  and anti-Semitic accounts gleefully [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3830.94s)]
*  sharing the song on theirs as well. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3832.7400000000002s)]

*  of the song encouraging anti-Semitic [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3836.98s)]
*  behavior from Kanye's fans. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3839.2200000000003s)]
*  Take a look. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3841.02s)]

*  say whatever you're going to say. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3843.34s)]

*  about that, I'm like, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3847.2200000000003s)]
*  what are you doing, man? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3848.5s)]

*  anything about it, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3851.2200000000003s)]
*  what are you doing, man? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3852.3s)]
*  At a minimum, you're just going to [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3853.26s)]
*  get more people that think it's [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3855.6200000000003s)]
*  cool to say, highlight. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3857.78s)]
*  That's not the minimum. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3859.42s)]
*  Well, I think that's part of [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3860.86s)]
*  the program. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3862.42s)]

*  trying to do. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3864.94s)]

*  I guess if you're like, well, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3867.46s)]
*  it's fun to troll the masses and [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3868.86s)]
*  get them to do that, okay. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3870.42s)]
*  But what I'm saying is that at a [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3872.1400000000003s)]
*  minimum, you're going to get less [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3874.1800000000003s)]
*  educated people to go, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3876.5400000000004s)]

*  I had been thinking about this all [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3894.34s)]
*  day and I still don't know where I [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3896.3s)]
*  fall on this, but I'm curious. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3898.3s)]
*  Do you think this song should be [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3900.34s)]
*  banned on streaming platforms? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3901.98s)]
*  We just had a knockout brawl [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3903.94s)]
*  debate a minute ago on the show, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3905.6600000000003s)]
*  right? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3907.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, catch the show live, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3908.26s)]

*  don't know, right? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3918.5s)]
*  So we asked it on the website, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3920.7s)]
*  should Kanye West's pro-Hitler song [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3922.5s)]
*  be banned on all platforms? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3924.74s)]

*  47 to 53, super close. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3929.58s)]
*  And it comes out to no on 53. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3932.82s)]
*  Okay, the live chat has a poll too. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3935.02s)]
*  Should the song be banned? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3938.2999999999997s)]
*  Let's pull that up in a second. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3940.1s)]
*  So live chats on YouTube, 60, 40, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3941.86s)]
*  no, okay, so now 59, 41. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3945.46s)]
*  So this is as tight as it's been in [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3949.38s)]
*  a long time for any topic. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3951.18s)]
*  And so why? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3952.9s)]
*  Guys, let's be super clear. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3953.8199999999997s)]
*  The song is terrible. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3957.54s)]
*  It's an all like, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3959.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't mean musically, I mean, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3960.5s)]
*  to put a song like that out there [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3962.66s)]
*  is despicable. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3964.9s)]
*  And so and Kanye West is a great [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3966.7s)]
*  gay moron. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3969.3s)]
*  And I'm really proud that as [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3970.7000000000003s)]
*  usual, I was the first and [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3972.2200000000003s)]
*  when I said it, what happened? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3973.6600000000003s)]
*  Back then people were like, and [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3975.34s)]
*  I'm not talking about when he [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3976.9s)]
*  started the anti-Semitism. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3978.3s)]
*  He was always a moron. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3979.78s)]
*  He was always the dumbest person [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3981.1800000000003s)]
*  I've ever heard speak. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3982.5800000000004s)]
*  Like whenever he spoke, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3983.9s)]
*  they'd be like, he's a genius. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3984.94s)]
*  No, just because he's decent at [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3986.1400000000003s)]
*  music doesn't mean his political [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3987.98s)]
*  opinions are smart. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3990.1400000000003s)]
*  He's always been the dumbest guy [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3992.1800000000003s)]
*  in the room, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3993.6600000000003s)]
*  maybe the dumbest guy in the nation. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3994.2200000000003s)]
*  And so when I was saying that, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3996.1400000000003s)]
*  I remember people say, no, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3997.34s)]
*  he's a genius, Cenk, how dare you? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3998.5s)]
*  He's a musical genius, right? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=3999.98s)]
*  Okay, well, I won that debate. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4001.94s)]
*  He's a freaking moron and [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4003.94s)]
*  it's idiot, anti-Semite, etc, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4005.5s)]
*  etc. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4007.74s)]
*  So I despise the song and [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4008.54s)]
*  I'm really worried about what [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4009.98s)]
*  Rogan's guest said there, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4011.5s)]
*  which is that people think it's [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4012.9s)]
*  catcher and then they start singing [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4014.5s)]
*  it. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4016.38s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4016.9s)]
*  On the other hand, if you ban it, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4019.26s)]
*  god damn it, then it's rebel, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4021.5s)]
*  rebellious and cool and [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4023.7s)]
*  underground and that kind of crap. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4025.34s)]
*  And so Jordan, I don't know, man, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4027.78s)]
*  banning hasn't worked, so [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4030.5400000000004s)]
*  I'm leaning 5347 to not banning it. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4032.6200000000003s)]
*  But then if you're not going to [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4037.3s)]
*  ban it, everybody has to say, yeah, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4038.6600000000003s)]
*  Kanye is a giant ass and no one [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4040.6600000000003s)]
*  should ever do any deals with Kanye, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4042.5s)]
*  not because you're Jewish, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4044.7000000000003s)]
*  or it's because he's a jerk. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4046.5400000000004s)]
*  He's a terrible human being. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4048.5800000000004s)]
*  So and then he can go complain [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4051.6200000000003s)]
*  about all the Jews. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4052.98s)]
*  No, brother, it wasn't the Jews. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4054.2200000000003s)]
*  Here, I'm Muslim, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4055.34s)]
*  born Muslim, now atheist, and [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4056.5s)]
*  I hate you. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4058.42s)]
*  I think you're an idiot and [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4059.54s)]
*  I would never do a deal with you, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4060.82s)]
*  okay? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4062.38s)]
*  So go cry about that. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4062.9s)]
*  All right, Jordan, I came out for [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4064.46s)]
*  not banning it, even though I have [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4066.38s)]
*  a long history of despising [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4068.42s)]
*  this moron. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4070.2200000000003s)]
*  What do you come out? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4071.38s)]
*  As I think through it, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4074.9s)]
*  I jump back and forth. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4076.38s)]
*  The knee jerk reaction seems like, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4077.9s)]
*  well, this is heinous. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4079.3s)]
*  This is deliberately inflammatory [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4080.06s)]
*  and anti-Semitic. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4082.7000000000003s)]
*  Let's get rid of it. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4084.2200000000003s)]
*  And then you think, okay, well, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4085.58s)]
*  that's like they say, and [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4087.02s)]
*  I think that would be human [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4088.06s)]
*  behavior, where people will only [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4089.2599999999998s)]
*  seek it out more. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4090.7s)]
*  It gives it attention, especially [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4091.94s)]
*  in our digital age, when you try to [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4093.74s)]
*  suppress something, it only makes [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4095.38s)]
*  people want to seek it out more. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4097.14s)]
*  And I think about the consequences [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4099.0199999999995s)]
*  of that, and you could think [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4101.0199999999995s)]
*  through, what would the [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4102.66s)]
*  justification be? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4104.0199999999995s)]
*  And I just don't want, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4105.82s)]
*  I certainly don't want big tech [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4107.22s)]
*  companies, and I certainly don't [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4109.0599999999995s)]
*  want our government dictating what [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4110.98s)]
*  can and can't be said, because [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4112.9s)]
*  we've already seen it for years. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4114.7s)]
*  Especially, just to go back to our [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4116.9s)]
*  last story, big tech companies have [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4119.38s)]
*  suppressed pro-Palestinian speech [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4122.139999999999s)]
*  online for the past year and a half. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4124.94s)]
*  You have seen now arrests on [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4128.139999999999s)]
*  college campuses. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4129.78s)]
*  It's not that this would lead to [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4131.34s)]
*  something worse, we're already in [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4133.139999999999s)]
*  an area where things are worse. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4135.26s)]
*  And I'm also even just talking [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4137.54s)]
*  about it, we're giving him what he [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4139.86s)]
*  wants, he did this specifically [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4142.46s)]
*  because he knew it would upset [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4145.099999999999s)]
*  people so much that it would get [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4147.22s)]
*  way more coverage on his self [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4149.5s)]
*  released album than if the album [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4151.46s)]
*  didn't include this track, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4153.62s)]
*  that's it, for the single. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4155.58s)]
*  Look, I don't know how much people [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4157.54s)]
*  are trolling him, I hope a lot, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4159.78s)]
*  right? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4161.9s)]
*  But for all the trolls for no [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4162.42s)]
*  reason, they're just getting their [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4164.3s)]
*  kicks and stuff, go troll that guy. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4166.86s)]
*  And you know what, I know what'll [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4169.3s)]
*  drive him crazy, do what I do. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4171.46s)]
*  Keep calling him dumb, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4173.62s)]
*  he's a super dumb guy. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4175.22s)]
*  And so he thinks he's a genius, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4177.46s)]
*  he's like, I got a white shirt, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4179.26s)]
*  I'm selling it for $250, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4181.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm such a genius. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4182.66s)]
*  I got a trash bag and [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4183.94s)]
*  I'm selling it for $500 because I'm [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4185.0599999999995s)]
*  a genius. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4187.099999999999s)]
*  No, you're an idiot, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4187.66s)]
*  that trash bag looks like trash, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4188.98s)]
*  that's just a white shirt and [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4190.98s)]
*  you're just a hateful idiot. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4192.66s)]
*  So go do that to him and [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4194.58s)]
*  see if he likes that attention. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yuUxVA8a3o&t=4195.74s)]
