# IDF Leadership Orders Soldiers To Do The UNTHINKABLE
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw)
*  The headline is chilling, IDF soldiers ordered to shoot deliberately at unarmed Gazans waiting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=0.0s)]
*  for humanitarian aid. It seems everyone, including ordinary hungry civilians are deemed to be [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=6.24s)]
*  targets. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=11.92s)]
*  The IDF is actually communicate the Gazan population by fire, by fired live ammunition. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=12.92s)]
*  As you saw right there, we're learning horrific new details about the IDF's recent conduct [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=22.8s)]
*  in Gaza thanks to a damning report from Israeli newspaper, Haaretz. And as the journalist [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=27.36s)]
*  was saying right there, the IDF was ordered by their leadership to communicate with totally [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=32.64s)]
*  unarmed peaceful Palestinians by firing at them with live ammunition as a policy going [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=38.88s)]
*  forward. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  And these details are horrific. The numbers are terrible, but we're going to run through [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=46.84s)]
*  all of it because not nearly enough people are paying attention to this story anymore, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=51.32s)]
*  particularly with what's going on with Iran. But the situation there remains as horrific [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  as anywhere in the world and the numbers are climbing every single day. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  And so these aid centers that have been the site of near daily massacres are run by the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=65.56s)]
*  Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. It's been in the Gaza Strip since May. It's an organization [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=70.36s)]
*  that was set up by Israel working with US evangelicals and private security contractors. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=76.52s)]
*  It's staffed by American and Palestinian workers and then secured by the IDF from a few hundred [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=82.8s)]
*  meters away. And since they've opened just one month ago, there have been 19 different [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  shooting incidents there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=94.56s)]
*  And according to the Gaza Health Ministry, 549 people have already been killed in just [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  one month near these aid centers. Just waiting for food, the small amount of food that is [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  allowed through when enough food exists for every single man, woman and children there [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  to be perfectly fine, but they don't let it in. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=113.2s)]
*  And then when it comes in, you are risking your life every single day going to get it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=115.6s)]
*  Over 4,000 people have been wounded and we don't know for sure what these numbers are. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=121.08s)]
*  That's what it's believed and those numbers are so insane. I mean, I was recently watching [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  Andor and they wanted to create a fictional scenario that would drill home how cruel and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=132.76s)]
*  evil a regime was. And they had a smaller massacre than that. And that was enough for [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=140.0s)]
*  people to understand who the bad guy in that story was. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=145.0s)]
*  And that number will be higher tomorrow and it'll be higher the day after that. And if [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=148.32s)]
*  you're a Palestinian in the area, there's nothing you can do but continue to go to the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=153.4s)]
*  place where you just might be murdered because otherwise you and your family will likely [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=157.84s)]
*  starve to death. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  And so this is not just a series of accidents or miscommunications, as Heretz reported. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=164.28s)]
*  This is the policy. This is working as it is supposed to. According to officers and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=169.94s)]
*  soldiers who served there, this is not just the people being murdered saying this. This [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=175.34s)]
*  is those serving in this area. The idea fires at people who arrive before opening hours [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=179.56s)]
*  to prevent them from approaching or again after the centers close to disperse them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=184.88s)]
*  Since some of the shooting incidents occurred at night ahead of the opening, it's possible [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=189.64s)]
*  that some civilians couldn't see the boundaries of the designated area. Others might have [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=193.52s)]
*  believed that worst case scenario they would be told to leave not shot by the military. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=198.16s)]
*  And so a lot of miscommunications here sort of understandably. One soldier said, it's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=204.28s)]
*  a killing field where I was stationed between one and five people were killed every day. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=209.36s)]
*  They're treated like a hostile force. No crowd control measures, no tear gas, just live [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=215.36s)]
*  fire with everything imaginable. Heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars. Then once [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=220.0s)]
*  the center opens, the shooting stops and they know they can approach. Our form of communication [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  is gunfire. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  We open fire early in the morning if someone tries to get in line from a few hundred meters [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  away and sometimes we just charge them from close range. But there's no danger to the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  forces. I'm not aware of a single instance of return fire. There's no enemy, no weapons. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=241.44s)]
*  This is not where they over exaggerate a threat. Someone threw a rock so they needed to blow [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=250.44s)]
*  up a building and kill a hundred civilians or whatever. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=255.36s)]
*  They're not even pretending that there's a threat. They just don't want to talk to the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=258.24s)]
*  They don't want to communicate with them, see them as humans. So instead, you shoot [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  them. You kill one, two, four, seven people a day and then the others, I guess, will get [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  the message. And so this is not like us reporting on, hey, the Guardian looked into it and six [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=273.16s)]
*  months ago there was a bad massacre. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=279.06s)]
*  It could be happening as we do this show. And by the time the Young Turks goes live [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=281.22s)]
*  on Monday, it will have happened multiple times again. And they are hoping, and we'll [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=285.66s)]
*  get more into the propaganda aspect of this. They are hoping that nobody gives a damn about [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=290.12s)]
*  this story anymore and doesn't care at all about the ever growing list of people who've [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=294.76s)]
*  been killed just desperately trying to feed their families. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=298.96s)]
*  Yeah, so lots of devastating facts here. First of all, when you target civilians on purpose, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=301.92s)]
*  that has a name. It's called being a terrorist. And so what I'm sick of is the racism in American [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=308.56s)]
*  media where they, if it's a Muslim that does something, terrorism instantly. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=314.74s)]
*  Half the time they don't even check to see if it's military or civilians. By the way, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=319.36s)]
*  did you know that out of the 1,200 killed in Israel on October 7th, about 400 were military? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=323.44s)]
*  So it's still a despicable act. They still killed over 800 civilians, but they just lump [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=329.16s)]
*  it all in. Even if you kill Israeli military, you're not allowed to do that, you're a terrorist. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  But Israel can kill your civilians on purpose. And no, they're not a terrorist state, because [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=338.22s)]
*  that only applies to Muslims. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  So it's just a racist word. It doesn't mean anything anymore, it's trash. Unless you say [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=345.64s)]
*  no, no, no, yes, from now on, we're calling Israel a terrorist state, cuz they are definitely [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=349.64s)]
*  killing civilians on purpose. And you know the daddy's unfortunately theme here, the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=355.0s)]
*  program they have where they wait for somebody that an AI picked to go home that they think [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=359.64s)]
*  might be connected to someone who else is connected to someone who was Hamas at some [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  point. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=373.16s)]
*  Again, it's AI picking, they have no idea, okay? And they wait for them to go home so [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=374.16s)]
*  that they could kill their entire family and their children along with them. So people [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=379.12s)]
*  who target children and civilians on purpose are terrorists, and that is the IDF. It's [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=384.6s)]
*  indisputable. The only reason why you would argue it is if you're racist and say, yeah, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=391.04s)]
*  no, only Muslims get called that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=395.56s)]
*  Okay, so I don't wanna hear anybody being offended about anti-Semitism. No, I get to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=398.16s)]
*  be racist towards you, but you don't get to be accurate in your labels against me. Okay, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=404.32s)]
*  so none of that crap. Okay, now let's talk about the wanton slaughter that Israel does [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=408.92s)]
*  in this despicable genocide, okay? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=413.76s)]
*  So this is straight out of the textbook genocide situation. I've told you this before, Serbanitza [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=416.84s)]
*  was considered genocide by the UN and by all scholars. About 8,000 Muslims were killed, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=426.32s)]
*  so a much lower number than here in Israel. And they targeted Muslims just like Israel [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=433.23999999999995s)]
*  is targeting Palestinians. And they did the same exact trick. And the soldiers explained [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=438.28s)]
*  later in Serbanitza, the Serb soldiers, we realized that if we starved them, it would [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=445.35999999999996s)]
*  be easier to kill them. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=449.94s)]
*  Because then when they came to get the food that we brought them, they were sitting ducks. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=451.32s)]
*  And then we just killed their civilians that were coming out for food. That's exactly what [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=456.16s)]
*  Israel's doing here. If you think that all of this is self-defense, you're a terrible [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=460.68s)]
*  person. It's not self-defense at all. October 7th was two years ago. They're still claiming [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=466.88000000000005s)]
*  self-defense as they've destroyed or damaged 92% of the buildings. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=473.64000000000004s)]
*  Okay, here's another part of the story that's just a side part where they're like, by the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=476.8s)]
*  way, they've hired American private contractors to literally destroy every home in Gaza. And [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=481.76000000000005s)]
*  they get paid $1,500 per home that they destroy. Wait, it always gets worse. They're given [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=487.68s)]
*  carte blanche. So if they see anyone near a home, including someone who owns the home, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=494.24s)]
*  they murder them. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  They have a right to kill any civilian around a home that they wanna demolish. And since [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  they're getting $1,500 per home that they're demolishing, they wanna hurry. So they were [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=507.24s)]
*  like, okay, go smash that one, smash that one. So wait, are you looking for a mosque? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=512.6s)]
*  No, they're destroying all the homes. And if anyone's near the homes, they murder them. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=516.24s)]
*  These are 100% terrorists. Okay, and then US evangelicals are part of this scheme. Think [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=520.88s)]
*  about how twisted you have to get Christianity. That you go near the birthplace of Jesus, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=528.12s)]
*  not to feed the hungry, but to murder the hungry. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=535.04s)]
*  No, stop calling yourselves Christians. You're not Christians at all. Tom Massey's right. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=538.48s)]
*  Real Christians don't want genocide, are not in favor of the slaughter of 17,000 children, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  or don't agree with the terrorism of Israel. And then every step of the way, just when [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=553.12s)]
*  you think it can't get worse, it does. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=561.7800000000001s)]
*  Israel has a version of the game Red Light, Green Light that you've seen in squid games, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=564.6600000000001s)]
*  a lot of you. They're saying basically, that's what they're playing with the people who are [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=568.7800000000001s)]
*  trying to get food. And so I saw last night, Gaza Journalists Under Fire by Brave New Films. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=575.58s)]
*  You should watch that movie, bravenewfilms.org. We'll put the link down below. Make sure you [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=582.0s)]
*  watch that movie. It is so powerful. Israel is clearly murdering journalists on purpose. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=586.78s)]
*  They're clearly murdering civilians on purpose. And so in this case, what they're reporting, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=592.42s)]
*  Haaretz is reporting, an Israeli paper, is they're saying, these people are desperate. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=599.58s)]
*  They're trying to get food for their kids. And that was in the movie, one of the guys [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=604.36s)]
*  who'd been shot trying to get food. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=609.46s)]
*  He's like, either my kids are gonna starve, or I'm gonna risk getting shot while trying [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=611.62s)]
*  to get food. So they have them stop and go, stop and go, and maybe they're amused at murdering [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=616.28s)]
*  them. When up, it was red light and you still went, so I murdered you. This is the current [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=622.24s)]
*  state of Israel, deeply, deeply terrorist state. And we give money to these terrorists. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=629.0s)]
*  Those bullets are paid for by American taxpayers. You know that sometimes at these food centers, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=636.24s)]
*  They throw hand grenades. They throw hand grenades at civilians coming to get food. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=641.06s)]
*  This is German level now. And I don't care at all if you're offended. If you're more [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=646.56s)]
*  offended by me calling the Israelis terrorists and Germans, then you are at the civilians [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=651.9399999999999s)]
*  that they're murdering. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=658.5s)]
*  Something wrong with your moral compass. Like if you're like, 70,000 dead kids, who cares? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=660.3599999999999s)]
*  He offended me with a word. He's not allowed to criticize us like that. Okay, then you're [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=666.42s)]
*  a terrible person. You should be spending all of your time trying to end this massacre. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=671.18s)]
*  I mean, Cenk, you said it all. I mean, this is sick by any stretch of it. It's sick. The [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=675.6999999999999s)]
*  Biden administration is complicit as hell. They got blood on their hands. President Biden [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=682.4599999999999s)]
*  should have done something about this when he was in office, because we knew what was [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=687.42s)]
*  going to happen when President Donald J. Trump got in office. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=692.14s)]
*  All he's doing is continuing what the Democrats set up. So it's not just President Biden. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=694.5s)]
*  It is that entire Congress is complicit in this genocide. And but by the grace of God [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=699.9s)]
*  there go I. And as a woman who was raised up in the Christian church, the black liberation [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=707.02s)]
*  theology, what would Jesus do? He wouldn't do any of this. He would be with the people. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=712.98s)]
*  You shoot them outright, then you starve them to death, and then you shoot them when they [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=719.66s)]
*  try to get food. I mean, this is sick as hell. And everybody should be thoroughly disgusted [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=723.14s)]
*  by this. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=732.26s)]
*  And Cenk and John, something that the United Nations Secretary General just put out about [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=733.26s)]
*  six hours ago. He said diplomacy and human dignity for all must prevail. What is wrong [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=738.5s)]
*  with that? I mean, I'm just trying to understand why people can't understand that. He said [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=743.9s)]
*  as people in Gaza face injury and death, this is what he stresses. We cannot, quoting him, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=747.9000000000001s)]
*  we cannot allow the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza to be pushed into the shadows. Amen [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=754.9000000000001s)]
*  to that. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=761.74s)]
*  This country is complicit. We have blood on our hands because it is our weapons, our money [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=763.08s)]
*  that's aiding and abetting a freaking genocide. And I know we talk about how many children [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=769.2600000000001s)]
*  that are killed because that is devastating. And we're hoping that when people hear the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=775.62s)]
*  word children are being killed, that they'll have a little more compassion and mercy. But [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=780.02s)]
*  that doesn't seem to work because it's Palestinians. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=784.38s)]
*  So as far as I'm concerned, Cenk and John, all of the innocent civilians that are being [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=787.54s)]
*  killed, whether they're children, men, women, family and friends, all of the people in that [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=793.46s)]
*  region are suffering. Either they're being right shot straight up, or they're being starved [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=799.58s)]
*  to death. And let's think about the water, not getting enough water, the types of diseases [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=805.14s)]
*  that are bubbling up because of all those buildings that have been destroyed. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=810.42s)]
*  The environmental damage that will take decades upon decades to remediate. This is a sickness. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=814.56s)]
*  We are violating American law. We're violating the 620I that is very clear that when a president [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=822.12s)]
*  of the United States of America has been informed that a country that we are giving weapons [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=831.88s)]
*  to is not allowing aid to come into the place for the civilians. That president is supposed [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=840.12s)]
*  to stop this. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=846.6s)]
*  So damn it, that goes for Biden who failed and definitely President Donald J. Trump is [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=847.6s)]
*  failing now. He ran and said he was gonna do this thing differently, not just in Gaza. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=852.56s)]
*  He said he wasn't gonna be a war president. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=857.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=860.44s)]
*  It's sick. This is sick. This is sick. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=860.94s)]
*  And now he's asking for a Nobel Peace Prize. If only there were a terrible conflict that you could [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=864.52s)]
*  do literally anything to help stop. Yeah. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=870.2s)]
*  It doesn't a war require equal size to have equal power. This is a war on Gaza, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=873.48s)]
*  cuz they don't have equal forces. They don't have European nations on their side that will [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=879.48s)]
*  weapon them up. This is a war on the Palestinians in Gaza. It is not an equal. It's not a war. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=884.92s)]
*  It's a war on. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-WNcP7Qkcw&t=892.76s)]
