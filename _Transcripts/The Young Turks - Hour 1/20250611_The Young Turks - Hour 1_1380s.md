"A network of GOP war hawks, led by conservative talk show host Mark Levin, is quietly pushing President Donald Trump to abandon his plans for diplomacy and bomb Iran, according to a report.
The disinformation-led campaign, however, is at odds with Trump‚Äôs allies, who are urging him to remain diplomatic when dealing with Iran, sources told Politico."*

# Trump Being Pushed by Warhawks to Attack Iran, Is He Listening???
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU)
*  We don't wanna bomb Iran. This is what the isolationists tell. We don't wanna bomb Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=0.0s)]
*  It'll start a war. We don't wanna bomb Iran. Well, I can't wait to see the plan [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=4.08s)]
*  that's gonna prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. The president has my 100% support. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=9.68s)]
*  And he's got you, the American people, who do not want Iran to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=15.6s)]
*  You're not pacifists. You're not isolationists. You're red blooded Americans. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=21.44s)]
*  Well, Politico is now reporting that a group of Republican war hawks, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=26.08s)]
*  including the pig that you just heard from, they're undertaking this effort to convince [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  the Trump White House to attack Iran. Obviously, this is at the behest of Israel, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=41.12s)]
*  which sees Iran as its top enemy. Which if that is what they think, then they can go to war with [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=46.64s)]
*  Iran themselves. But of course, they wanna drag the United States into it. And Mark Levin, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=53.44s)]
*  the individual you just heard from, is claiming that the report is false. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=58.32s)]
*  He's saying it's false, and he's accusing the writer of being a scribe for the isolationists. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=62.32s)]
*  Which sounds pretty good, by the way. But before we get into that, let's dive into the reporting [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=71.12s)]
*  itself. So Politico reports that according to an intelligence official, as well as another Trump [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  ally familiar with the matter, during a private lunch with the President at the White House last [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=82.64s)]
*  Wednesday, conservative talk show host Mark Levin told Trump that Iran was, get a load of this, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=88.16s)]
*  this is so hilarious, days away, days away from building a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=94.16s)]
*  An argument Trump's own intelligence team has told the President is not accurate. You wanna know who [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=101.2s)]
*  else said that Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon is days away, days away. Netanyahu in 2012, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=109.12s)]
*  and then again in 2015. Go fight your own war, bitch. Wad, back to you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's important for people to know Mark Levin's background and history. This guy is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=122.4s)]
*  your neocons neocon. There's never been a war, particularly in the Middle East, that he didn't [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=135.36s)]
*  want the US to intervene on. A regime that wasn't completely sycophantic to the US foreign policy [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=142.4s)]
*  establishment that they didn't wanna topple. It's never happened. There's never been a case where [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=151.44000000000003s)]
*  it's like, no, no, no, maybe we shouldn't do X, Y, and Z over in the Middle East. And so this guy [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=157.52s)]
*  ringing the alarm bells and saying, quote unquote, Iran is about to make a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=163.28s)]
*  Another thing that I would challenge, do Americans not wanna ran to have a nuclear weapon? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=168.72s)]
*  Seems like the only countries we ever leave alone are those that possess nuclear weapons. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=174.72s)]
*  The only countries we don't go out of our way to go to war with and pick a fight with directly [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=180.72s)]
*  anyway. I'm not talking about stuff like Russia, etc. Are those with nuclear weapons? Would it be [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=186.48s)]
*  the end of the world? I don't think so. I mean, look, I think Israel fears Iran obtaining a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=192.56s)]
*  nuclear weapon, not because they actually think Iran is going to use said nuclear weapon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=200.72s)]
*  It's a deterrent. Yeah, it's a deterrent. Why do you think that in regard to US foreign policy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=206.72s)]
*  in Ukraine, I think that there have been examples of the US being irresponsible in some cases. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=213.36s)]
*  But also, they have been cautious in some context because they know Russia is a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=220.0s)]
*  nuclear country. They have nuclear weapons. And so Iran knows because Israel's been so vocal about [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=226.56s)]
*  it for decades at this point, that Israel wants the US to go to war with Iran on its behalf. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=234.64s)]
*  If you have a nuclear weapon, the US might be less incentivized to do that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=242.0s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? So I understand the argument in favor of allowing Iran to develop [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=246.96s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. In fact, there's a whole political theory called nuclear peace theory, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  which sounds insane, but it is a theory. If everybody had one, we'd be at peace. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=257.6s)]
*  That's the argument. I don't know if I fully buy that argument, but I do think that it [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  could potentially serve as a deterrent in the context of Iran obtaining one. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=268.0s)]
*  That being said, I'm not fully convinced that Iran should have one. But [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=272.32s)]
*  Israel's got nuclear weapons and no one's making a big deal about that. In fact, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=276.0s)]
*  they still deny that they have nuclear weapons, which is hilarious. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=279.68s)]
*  But nonetheless, according to Reuters, estimates of how long it would take for Iran to build a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=283.04s)]
*  nuclear weapon do vary not from a matter of days, but potentially between months and a year. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=288.72s)]
*  Now, one of the goals of the Iran nuclear agreement that was signed and accomplished [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=299.44s)]
*  by the Obama administration in 2015 was to ensure that Iran was basically limiting their [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=304.08s)]
*  nuclear program to ensure that they would not be able to produce a weapon for some time, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=313.52s)]
*  up to a year, right? And indeed, Iran's enrichment of uranium plummeted while the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=321.84s)]
*  deal was still intact. That was the deal that Netanyahu convinced Donald Trump to rip up in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=328.24s)]
*  2018, I believe it was. And so you'll see exactly what happened with this visual, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=335.68s)]
*  So you see all of this nuclear activity up until 2015. At that point, they stop enriching uranium. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=341.36s)]
*  And then once Trump pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=351.04s)]
*  they go back to enriching uranium because there's no nuclear deal anymore. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=354.24s)]
*  And you need the enriched uranium in order to build the nuclear weapon. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=357.68s)]
*  So do you think it was an accident that Netanyahu wanted the US to rip up the Iran nuclear deal? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=362.0s)]
*  It wasn't an accident. He knew, he didn't want a deal. He didn't want diplomacy. He just wants us [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=369.92s)]
*  to go to war and carry out regime change again in Iran. It's gross, it's so gross. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=376.0s)]
*  And one of his biggest supporters is Mark Levin, as you mentioned. He's a hardcore neocon. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=383.68s)]
*  And so Levin is furious that there's now a faction within the conservative movement, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=391.68s)]
*  the Republican Party, that is isolationist. And they don't wanna go to war in the Middle East. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=398.48s)]
*  They don't wanna send our troops to Iran. And he's pissed about it, okay? Tucker Carlson happens to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=403.12s)]
*  be on the right side of this particular issue. He doesn't want the US to go to war with Iran. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=408.08s)]
*  Levin has attacked him pretty viciously for that. In fact, Levin urged Trump to allow [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  the Israeli government to strike Iranian nuclear sites, which Trump has told Israeli Prime Minister [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=418.56s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu would torpedo the diplomacy. That's not the bug, that's the feature. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  I think Trump knows that. I don't know for sure though. Levin has also publicly been raging against [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=430.48s)]
*  Trump's special envoy. I've kinda shared this with you before. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=436.96s)]
*  So Steve Witkoff is someone that Levin despises because Witkoff, at least rhetorically, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=441.36s)]
*  and there have been some examples, wants to kind of try diplomacy first and see if that works out. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=447.44s)]
*  But aside from Levin, MAGA loyalists have been warily eyeing Rupert Murdoch's papers, particularly [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=452.56s)]
*  the New York Post, as they've savaged Witkoff, suggesting at one point that he's a mouthpiece [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=459.36s)]
*  for cut talk. He's Jewish, by the way. The allegations have infuriated some in Trump's [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=466.72s)]
*  inner circle, who see them as an effort to undercut the talks. And referring to the alleged [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=473.04s)]
*  lobbying campaign, anonymous senior administration official told Politico, they're trying to push [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  the president to make a decision. That's not what he wants. There's clearly a lobby for war [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=485.04s)]
*  with Iran versus those who are more aligned with the president, God, I hope so, that know he is [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=492.0s)]
*  the one that has been able to bring them to the negotiating table, meaning Iran. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  And I mean, Obama obviously brought them to the negotiating table too, but don't just forget about [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=503.12s)]
*  that. Encourage Trump to continue pursuing a diplomatic deal with Iran because we shouldn't [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  go to war with Iran. That would be a disaster. For reasons that I've described on the show before, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=514.56s)]
*  we can get into it again, but I want to give you a chance to weigh in, Was. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  Just a couple of things I find to be interesting. One is the idea that you would smear a guy as an [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=521.5999999999999s)]
*  agent of the Qataris. The implication being like, it's a foreign nation state that's wielding [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=528.56s)]
*  influence to shape US policy abroad. While doing what they do on behalf of Israel. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=536.32s)]
*  It's just hilarious. These people, they have such nerve. It's kind of crazy. The other, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=545.84s)]
*  well, you're influenced. He might be influenced by foreign cash. And that's terrible. And it's just [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  just hilarious to me. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=563.2s)]
*  On a case. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=564.4s)]
*  Who's gambling in this establishment. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=564.8s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And the other thing I find to be pretty interesting is that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's assent in the Republican Party does break up a few of the hegemonic sort of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=575.44s)]
*  religious ideas that have been in the GOP forever, which is one free trade where you see with the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=583.6s)]
*  tariffs where he's just like straight up. I hate free trade. I hate NAFTA. We want to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=589.92s)]
*  terrorist people into oblivion, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And just the idea that his foreign [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=594.64s)]
*  policy team isn't completely staffed by neocons. This would have been unimaginable in the George [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  W. Bush years in a John McCain presidency, a Mitt Romney presidency would have been utterly [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=608.24s)]
*  unimaginable that anybody but neocons would have been influential in that foreign policy [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=614.8s)]
*  wing of the administration. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=621.36s)]
*  I mean, look, the neocons might end up winning out. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=623.84s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  In the end, we hope not. But just the idea that there is some kind of faction that is working [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=627.76s)]
*  against the neocon ideology is quite interesting, honestly. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=634.16s)]
*  Yeah, and you're right about the Bush years. There were no Republicans who were not hawkish [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=639.44s)]
*  at that time. So this emergence of the, I don't even like calling them isolationists. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't think they're necessarily isolationists. I think that they're actually seeing what's [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=652.48s)]
*  happening in the Middle East clearly because of our foibles in the past. You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=656.24s)]
*  So one of those people, by the way, is Tucker Carlson. And I never thought in a million years [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  that I would say that Tucker Carlson is giving me some hope on a situation. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=667.2s)]
*  But in this particular case, he is because he's got the ear of the president, believe it or not. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=673.2800000000001s)]
*  They talk. And while Levin is lobbying for war, Tucker Carlson is trying to influence [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=678.6400000000001s)]
*  Trump to go in the diplomatic direction. And that's a good thing. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=685.0400000000001s)]
*  So hours after Levin's meeting with Trump, Tucker Carlson weighed in and he accused him of trying [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=688.96s)]
*  to bully the US into war, riding on X. There is zero credible intelligence that suggests Iran is [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=695.6s)]
*  anywhere near building a bomb or has plans to, none. So why is Mark Levin once again hyperventilating [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=703.12s)]
*  about weapons of mass destruction, which is what manufactured consent to invade Iraq, of course, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=710.08s)]
*  to distract you from the real goal, which is regime change. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=717.2s)]
*  Young Americans heading back to the Middle East to topple yet another government. Where's the lie? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=720.96s)]
*  Where's the lie? That's totally true. That is totally true. And look, people like to [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=728.1600000000001s)]
*  air their suspicions about Tucker Carlson and what his real motivations are. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=735.52s)]
*  I don't care. As long as this is the message that's being pushed out to the right, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=739.36s)]
*  to conservatives, and they're aware of it, they're aware of the accusation. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  That gives me a little bit of hope that Trump might even get some pressure from a huge portion [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=750.0s)]
*  of his own base who do not want to go to war with Iran. What do you think, Was? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=756.08s)]
*  Yeah, just a couple of things on that. Obviously, yeah, Tucker Carlson, not exactly a left-wing hero [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=760.4000000000001s)]
*  by any stretch. But even the sun shines on a dog's ass, as they say, right? And he happens to be [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=768.72s)]
*  right about the foreign policy element here. And just for our audience, to think about it, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=776.56s)]
*  slightly different from where Tucker Carlson is taking it. Yes, it would be a disaster on [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=786.16s)]
*  our resources as a country in terms of how much it would cost. The human capital and the human cost [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  would be astronomical. Make no mistake, they failed in Iraq. They even failed in Afghanistan [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=798.7199999999999s)]
*  against the freaking Taliban, who took over a day after we left. We were there for 20 years, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=805.76s)]
*  they took over a day after we left. Iran is another beast on another universe from those [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=811.28s)]
*  countries and those regimes. So much stronger, okay? So much more entrenched, so much bigger [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=818.8s)]
*  armies. It's just a whole other whatever. And let's just say- [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=827.12s)]
*  Hey, no, hold on. I gotta weigh in on that, just to bolster what you're saying, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=831.76s)]
*  cuz you're absolutely right. Guys, Iran arms the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=834.88s)]
*  How long were we involved in Yemen trying to beat the Houthis? Did we win? Did we win? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=844.24s)]
*  I'm just saying. Those are a bunch of dudes in caves, guys. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=852.4s)]
*  And we couldn't do anything with them. Our trillion dollar military budget couldn't do [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=858.8s)]
*  anything with these dudes in caves. And let's just say again, it's not gonna be a cake wall, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=864.8000000000001s)]
*  it's gonna be a disaster. There's no way for this to not end in disaster. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=870.64s)]
*  Now, you destabilize that country and all you have is death, despair, hunger, chaos, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=875.0400000000001s)]
*  utter chaos in a place. That's if we achieve our goal, guys. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=884.32s)]
*  The American dream. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=888.4s)]
*  Like that's if we achieve our goal. And Iran, just so we're clear here, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=889.8399999999999s)]
*  cuz Netanyahu keeps saying, we should give them the Libya plan. He keeps calling it the Libya plan, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=895.68s)]
*  which is Gaddafi, the former ruler of Libya. He agreed with the US to leave his nuclear program [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=902.8s)]
*  alone. And he was friends with the US at the time, so he could put some faith and trust in that. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=910.0799999999999s)]
*  Fast forward a couple of decades, US turned against them. Rebels raid the capital, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=915.12s)]
*  they capture this dude and sodomize this guy in broad daylight on the street. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=921.36s)]
*  Well, things are better in Libya, aren't they? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=927.6s)]
*  Oh my, it's never been worse. And so you think those people in Iran, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=929.84s)]
*  when they're trying to be convinced to let go of their nuclear program and do it like Gaddafi did, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=936.0s)]
*  they have TVs, guys. They know what happened there. They're not idiots. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=942.96s)]
*  And so, yeah, that's why I think you're seeing the desperation. I think the neocons are [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=947.12s)]
*  understanding that Trump can see the obvious wisdom in pursuing a deal with Iran, even though [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=952.8s)]
*  Barry did it 10 years ago already, whatever. Pursuing a deal with these folks rather than [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=959.2s)]
*  going the war method. Now, Rupert Murdoch is also a neocon, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=965.84s)]
*  wants to drum up support for a war in Iran. And so, is Trump listening to Rupert Murdoch [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=971.84s)]
*  and Mark Levin? Politico also writes, or they share a perspective from a Trump confidant who [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=979.84s)]
*  says that Levin and Murdoch are all over Trump all the time. I actually think they hurt their case, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=985.9200000000001s)]
*  because I know Trump. Once he's kind of made up his mind or made his mind up, you can come at it [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=991.84s)]
*  later from a different angle, but you keep pressing, he digs in. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=998.64s)]
*  But on the other hand, twice this week, two times this week, Trump appeared kind of skeptical that [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1003.52s)]
*  a deal with Iran was even possible. Let's watch. And what's the main impediment to getting a deal? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1010.72s)]
*  Well, they're just asking for things that you can't do. They don't want to give up what they [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1017.44s)]
*  have to give up, you know what that is. They seek enrichment. We can't have enrichment. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1023.2s)]
*  We want just the opposite. And so far, they're not there. I hate to say that, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1030.32s)]
*  because the alternative is a very, very dire one, but they're not there. They have given us [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1038.16s)]
*  their thoughts on the deal. And I said, it's just not acceptable. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1046.24s)]
*  Do you think you're gonna be able to stop Iran from enriching its- [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1049.84s)]
*  I don't know. I did think so. And I'm getting more and more less confident about it. They seem to be [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1054.8s)]
*  delaying it. I think that's a shame, but I'm less confident now than I would have been a couple of [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1063.4399999999998s)]
*  months ago. If they don't make a deal, they're not gonna have a nuclear weapon. It would be nicer to [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1068.9599999999998s)]
*  do it without warfare, without people dying. It's so much nicer to do it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1074.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or maybe we can just not go to war with Iran. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1078.56s)]
*  Is that even a consideration? Is that even a consideration? There are three options. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1086.8s)]
*  Option one, the best option, is to get Iran to sign a new nuclear deal, which I wish Trump had [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1091.68s)]
*  never ripped up to begin with. But okay, the second best option is if we fail to get a [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1097.84s)]
*  diplomatic deal with Iran, then we just stand back. I don't see Iran as a threat to us. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1104.9599999999998s)]
*  I don't. Just because Israel says Iran is a threat to us, and just because you have some people [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1111.9199999999998s)]
*  chanting death to America doesn't mean Iran. In this current war, okay, that's going on in [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1117.36s)]
*  the Middle East. Which country has actually shown the most restraint? I'm serious. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1122.96s)]
*  Israel has gone into Iran and assassinated a bunch of people. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1130.56s)]
*  And you know what Iran does in retaliation? They let them know 72 hours in advance. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1134.72s)]
*  Here is where we're going to do missile strikes in a remote part where no one is gonna get hurt and [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1141.28s)]
*  nothing will be damaged. 72 hours, get ready so Jordan can get ready to defend Israel, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1146.72s)]
*  so they can have their missile defense system ready. Iran is the country which in this current [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1154.32s)]
*  context has shown way more restraint than Israel has. It's just amazing to me that we're really [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1160.56s)]
*  considering starting another war with another Middle Eastern country with the intention to [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1166.64s)]
*  engage in regime change. After all the failures that we've had in the Middle East in my lifetime, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1172.56s)]
*  it's insane. Tucker Carlson is right on this issue. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1178.8799999999999s)]
*  Obviously, don't belabor it with Trump because apparently he digs his heels in. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1184.0s)]
*  But Iran should be able to enrich enough uranium for energy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1187.76s)]
*  Yeah, domestic nuclear uses, yeah, for sure. And another thing too that we do have to realize [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1194.48s)]
*  about the Trump rhetoric in public, there's reports out there that behind the scenes that [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1202.96s)]
*  they're telling the Iranians, no, doing your domestic nuclear program is not a problem. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1207.92s)]
*  But in public, he's always going to give the most maximalists of demands in public and pretend like [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1213.44s)]
*  he's acting. It's just what he thinks negotiating is, is to be as ridiculous in your demands [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1223.2s)]
*  publicly as possible in your initial ask. But yeah, there are reports that behind the scenes, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1229.8400000000001s)]
*  they're telling the Iranians that the domestic uses for nuclear are completely fine. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1236.32s)]
*  And again, we'd just be doing this just to do a favor for Israel, straight up. This is a power [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1243.2s)]
*  in the region that Israel can't just push around. They know they can't send the IDF in there to [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1250.16s)]
*  invade and start a war. That would be disastrous. They'd get their butts handed to them. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1257.1200000000001s)]
*  And so it's like, yeah, let me go get my big brother on the kids on the block who I don't like. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1263.2s)]
*  That's all that you're seeing here, folks. Yep, I'm gonna leave you with one final thing. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1270.0s)]
*  I know that this story has gone too long, but it's an important one. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1274.0800000000002s)]
*  Mark Levin is a liar. So when he says that Iran is just days away from having a nuclear weapon, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1276.64s)]
*  you shouldn't believe him because he has a history of lying. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1286.16s)]
*  In fact, get a load of this lie given what we just learned from Politico's reporting. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1289.76s)]
*  Final video. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1295.5200000000002s)]
*  So I called the President of the United States early this morning, which I don't often do. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1296.16s)]
*  He and I are very close friends. I know this upsets the isolationists and the fifth columnists [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  and their media mouthpieces and propagandists. I said, Mr. President, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1311.2s)]
*  have I lobbied you about Iran? He said, no. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1318.3200000000002s)]
*  I said, Mr. President, when we met last week, did I lobby you about Iran? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1321.76s)]
*  He said, no. The President knows exactly where I stand on Iran. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1330.56s)]
*  And he told me he knows exactly where I stand on Iran, because he watches my shows on Fox [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1335.44s)]
*  on Saturday and Sunday. The whole world knows where I stand on Iran. What I am not doing, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1342.96s)]
*  and what I would not do to Donald Trump is lead a lobbying campaign of hawks, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1349.76s)]
*  as it was put in Politico. War hawks. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1356.72s)]
*  No one should take this man seriously. He is a proven liar. He's not even fun to look at. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1362.08s)]
*  What's left? What's the point? Watch something else, anything else. What a waste of your time. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1367.92s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1373.2s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRltvO20YgU&t=1376.56s)]
