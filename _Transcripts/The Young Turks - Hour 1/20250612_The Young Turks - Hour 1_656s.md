Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# BREAKING: Israel Strikes Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664)
*  Wait, what's going on? Hold on. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=0.0s)]
*  God damn it, man. God damn it. God damn it. Israel just struck Iran. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=1.52s)]
*  I know we shouldn't have interrupted the story about Fetterman, but- [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=8.08s)]
*  Jesus Christ. Where is who's reporting this? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=12.48s)]
*  What a liability that country is to the United States of America. Total liability, not an ally, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=19.2s)]
*  disgusting. Just as the United States was gonna enter another round of diplomatic talks with [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  Iran this weekend, disgusting. Look, I don't have an article in front of me. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=31.52s)]
*  This is Ken Klippenstein, who I obviously trust, posting on X. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=36.56s)]
*  Israel tapped him on Friday morning. I guess it's Friday over there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Breaking news. All right, guys, obviously this just broke. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=48.96s)]
*  Please forgive me if anything changes from what I'm about to share with you. Obviously, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=53.76s)]
*  this is a developing story. So according to CNN, Israel has launched what it called [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  preemptive strikes, much like the United States doing preemptive strikes on Iraq, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=66.56s)]
*  against Iran in this case. And a state of emergency has been declared in Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=72.32s)]
*  I hope the Israeli civilians enjoy the fear that they're now living in because of their [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=78.39999999999999s)]
*  belligerent government carrying out strikes in Iran. Unbelievable, unbelievable. And this is, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=84.32s)]
*  according to the country's defense minister, Israel Katz, a well-known genocider, someone who [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=91.28s)]
*  we should not be considered allies of. But alas, our country is beholden to the great [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=96.8s)]
*  government of Israel. This is his statement, following the state of Israel's preemptive [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=101.6s)]
*  strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack against the state of Israel and its civilian [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=106.55999999999999s)]
*  population is expected in the immediate future. Then why did you guys do it? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=111.36s)]
*  Iranian state media outlet IRNA reported repeated explosions could be heard in Tehran, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  which is the capital of Iran, of course. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=126.16s)]
*  Let's go to a live shot of Woz with his adorable cat. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=131.68s)]
*  Just so I don't lose my mind. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  Sorry, guys, I'm reading the New York Times in real time here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=142.4s)]
*  I think Trump knew they were gonna do it today. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=147.28s)]
*  I would be shocked if there isn't any coordination with the United States. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=151.44s)]
*  We don't know for sure yet, obviously, developing story, but I would be shocked. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=155.84s)]
*  So congratulations, America. We have now entered another Middle Eastern war on behalf of Israel. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=160.32s)]
*  Congratulations. So pathetic. It's absolutely pathetic. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  How many trillions of dollars is this gonna suck out of our resources? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=175.52s)]
*  How many innocent people are gonna die by escalating [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=179.68s)]
*  a ridiculous war, another ridiculous war in the Middle East? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=184.96s)]
*  I don't know what else to say. I don't know what else there is left to say. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=190.08s)]
*  All right, let me go to the New York Times, see if there's anything [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=195.68s)]
*  more that I can share with you all. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=199.52s)]
*  They don't have anything, honestly. They're just saying they don't like the scale and the size is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=200.96s)]
*  not known yet. But the Iranian state TV is like we're gonna get them back quickly, swiftly. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't know, this might have just been Israeli, just like, we're just gonna hit you just to hit [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=215.68s)]
*  you, might not have actually done something. I mean, they're bombing the Capitol. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=222.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. Residents of Tehran reported hearing the sound of back to back explosions that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=226.56s)]
*  rattled windows and shook the ground. This is just, anyway, I don't know, I'm not sure. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=234.8s)]
*  Anyway, I'm not in the mood to talk about anything else, to be honest with you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=243.52s)]
*  We've got 10 minutes left. I'm really worried about what this is gonna do, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=249.68s)]
*  what this is gonna mean. I'm gonna read some of your comments. So if you're a member, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  right now is a good time to write in and tell me what you think about what's going on. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=258.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=268.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's just no argument for this at all in terms of the US and our interests. And [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  I think there's this idea that we have this unlimited capability and power, which is just [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  not true. We've spent the last two, three years arming the hell out of Israel and Ukraine, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  depleting our own weapons reserves. So we can't start a war with the Iran tomorrow. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=297.06s)]
*  That's not a thing. Not that we would want to, that we can't. And just strategically, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=304.26s)]
*  I was told that we were gearing up to start a brand new Cold War with China. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=311.54s)]
*  I thought China was the thing that we were supposed to be concentrating all of our [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=317.86s)]
*  energies towards. Obviously, I don't agree with that. I honestly think we overrate China's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=323.7s)]
*  desire to be some military omnipresent, imperial power everywhere. I think they wanna control Asia [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=330.82s)]
*  for sure. And they wanna decrease our influence in that region of the world. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  But this idea that they want or need global dominance, I think is way overstated. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=345.78s)]
*  But whatever, that's the posture that a lot of the people in the foreign policy establishment [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=350.5s)]
*  have decided they wanna take towards China. Okay, cool. Going to war with Iran on behalf of the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=355.62s)]
*  Israelis, and for what? There's no imminent invasion of Israel. From Iran's side, there's no, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=363.38s)]
*  yo, we're going to start a hot war. None of that is imminent. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=373.38s)]
*  This is just- You guys think that Israel is only eyeing [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=376.82s)]
*  Gaza and the West Bank? I mean, they've already illegally annexed a part of Syria. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=381.22s)]
*  They've tried to annex part of Lebanon. It's the great Israel project. And Iran was standing in [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=387.3s)]
*  the way. If they have a nuclear weapon, that serves as a deterrent. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=394.34000000000003s)]
*  If they have a nuclear weapon, that serves as a deterrent. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=398.82000000000005s)]
*  Israel doesn't like deterrents in the region. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=402.5s)]
*  General Wesley Clark disclosed perfectly what he experienced as a military general, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=407.54s)]
*  what the directive was. This goes beyond, we see Iran as a threat to our security. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  It's just so gross. And I hate the fact that we're gonna get dragged into this. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=424.26000000000005s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, it's unnecessary. Yeah, and the pivot to Asia that you were talking about was. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=428.98s)]
*  I don't know how that happens with our depleted resources. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=437.54s)]
*  It's not going to happen. And our god, Danny Bessner, he makes the point. He's like, bro, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=440.66s)]
*  China is a great country with a great people. These people have existed for thousands and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=448.1s)]
*  thousands of years. They were proud people. They've built up their economic capabilities. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=454.5s)]
*  We can't just bully them in Asia from now till kingdom come. It makes no sense, right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=461.54s)]
*  Instead of shoring up our own situation or perhaps negotiating a long lasting, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=468.18s)]
*  peaceful coexistence where it's like, yeah, we get it. We're probably gonna have to move on [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=476.18s)]
*  from Taiwan at some point. No, let's be belligerent, pretend that this is 1960. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=481.94s)]
*  And we've got like, or 1965 or whatever, and we've got the greatest economic power [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=489.54s)]
*  in comparison to the rest of the world that has ever been seen. That's just not the case, bro. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=497.14s)]
*  They're calling it a multipolar moment for a reason. It's not just us. We don't just get to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=502.9s)]
*  push everybody around anymore. China has a huge economy, bunch of people there, India, Brazil. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=509.06s)]
*  We're talking about major powers in other places. We don't get to just dictate terms all day, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=517.46s)]
*  every day. And cool, and even if we wanted to try to, aiding Israel in this cowboy mission [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=523.7s)]
*  in Iran, again, I'm telling y'all, Iraq was a joke. That turned into a disaster within two years. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=532.82s)]
*  It was just obvious that this was a horrible idea. Iraq, I should say, excuse me. Iran is, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=542.74s)]
*  they are 10 times more organized. The country is so freaking huge. They have a way bigger military. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=551.3000000000001s)]
*  Another thing is, as much as they've had problems in the past with protests and uprisings and all [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=559.78s)]
*  of that, their people are going to rally behind the effort. They're going to have the support of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=568.02s)]
*  the entire population against the Israelis in the freaking US. This is so insane. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=575.62s)]
*  Yeah, it is insane. It is absolutely insane. Mark Levin, welcome. Okay, he should be forced to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=583.62s)]
*  go fight on the front lines once there are American boots on the ground in Iran. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=593.62s)]
*  All the neocons. I mean, the rage I feel right now is so reminiscent of what I felt in the lead up [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=597.94s)]
*  to our preemptive war in Iraq. I can't believe we're here again. And look, it would be so based. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6JxoeN664&t=604.5s)]
