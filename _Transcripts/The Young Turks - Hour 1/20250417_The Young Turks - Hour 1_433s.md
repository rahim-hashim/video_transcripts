"President Donald Trump addressed Thursday's shooting at Florida State University.

At a press conference later on Thursday, officials confirmed that two people died in the shooting and at least six others are injured, including the suspect. The Leon County Sheriff said the suspected shooter, 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, is the son of a sheriff's deputy. Ikner's mother's former service weapon was used in the shooting, authorities said."

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Watch Trump's UNDERWHELMING Reaction To FSU Shooting
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00)
*  I guess it's an active shooter. Fully briefed as to where we are right now, it's a shame. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a horrible thing, horrible that things like this take place. And we'll have more [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=7.04s)]
*  to say about it later. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=13.24s)]
*  Today a shooting at Florida State University has left at least two killed and six injured. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=18.32s)]
*  And he just heard from President Donald Trump who was asked to react to the news while it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  was still developing. And as you just heard him say, things like this take place. Cenk, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=28.08s)]
*  do you think that that is going to be any monocle of comfort for the families and friends [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=34.32s)]
*  of the victims? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=39.56s)]
*  No, of course not. And so, look, I agree with Trump in an ironic kind of way. Now to be [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=40.56s)]
*  fair, he said it's horrible. It's horrible that things like this take place, right? So [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=48.04s)]
*  okay, sure that we all agree to that. But he did seem a little bit like, well, what [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=52.08s)]
*  am I going to do with things like this take place? And it's a little bit of a Rorschach [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  test, depending on how you see that clip. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=60.72s)]
*  But to me, the part that is the ironic agreement is, guys, I don't think that our politicians [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=64.2s)]
*  are going to do anything about this. And you've heard me say this now dozens of times, it [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=70.52s)]
*  might even be hundreds at this point, after all the mass shootings that we cover, and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=75.36s)]
*  we've covered a lot of them. We're the mass shooting capital of the world, and our politicians [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=79.12s)]
*  don't care. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=84.7s)]
*  I mean, another way of phrasing it is we're the mass murder capital of the world. And [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=85.7s)]
*  by a lot, it's not even close. And our politicians never, ever, ever do anything about it. So [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=90.54s)]
*  yeah, yeah, things like this are going to keep taking place, and our politicians are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=98.34s)]
*  never going to represent us. And now they're on a loop. So years and years ago, I used [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  to tell you, listen, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but shootings like this are going [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  to happen near you soon. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=112.94s)]
*  Because everybody kept getting surprised, I can't believe there was a mass shooting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=114.62s)]
*  near me. At this point, you should be surprised if there hasn't been a mass shooting near [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=117.2s)]
*  you. There's one every single day in America. This one just happens to be a little bit more [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=121.58s)]
*  spectacular. It's on a college campus, a lot of people killed and wounded, etc. Spectacular, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=126.58s)]
*  obviously, in a terrible way, in the wrong direction. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=134.06s)]
*  But now it's gone so bad, he has that it's looping. This is the second shooting on FSU's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=138.34s)]
*  campus. An earlier one was in 2014. So now every place is going to get two mass shootings. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=144.94s)]
*  So you can look forward to that because our politicians will never, ever do anything. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=151.72s)]
*  No, I think you're absolutely right. And it's also a little interesting that we're covering [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=155.5s)]
*  this story when it relates very closely to a story we're going to cover later on in the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=160.68s)]
*  show. So as far as the shooting goes, here's what we know so far. The suspected shooter's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=165.42s)]
*  name is Phoenix Ickner. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=170.54s)]
*  The suspect is the son of a sheriff's deputy and had access to one of her weapons. The [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=172.57999999999998s)]
*  suspect was shot by responders and is currently hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=178.1s)]
*  According to local law enforcement, the two victims who were killed were not FSU students. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=184.16s)]
*  Chris Coots, 51, was a professor of urban planning at the school. And it was said that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=189.61999999999998s)]
*  he was baffled by what had happened. This is the second one since I've been here, he [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=195.06s)]
*  said as he walked to his car after having sheltered in place. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=199.1s)]
*  He was referring to a 2014 shooting in which a gunman wounded three people in the university [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=202.98s)]
*  library. Of course, that is what Cenk was just referring to. An FSU student on the scene [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  called out Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis saying, I'm going to call on Governor [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=219.22s)]
*  This stuff keeps going on. We're praying every day. Praying is good, spirituality is good, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=221.34s)]
*  but prayers don't do much. It's good for the soul, but is this still happening? I think [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=226.82s)]
*  it is, so we need to make some gun reforms and that is from an FSU student. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=232.18s)]
*  And again, as I said, we are gonna talk a little bit about this in another story that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=236.02s)]
*  we're covering later on in the show. So it is just interesting that this is such a late [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=239.76s)]
*  addition to the show, but we had to cover it, we had to come up and mention it. But [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=244.18s)]
*  I agree with Cenk. How many times can we have this exact same conversation? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=248.22s)]
*  Every time there's a school shooting, we have to go through the same rigmarole. We have [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  to wait for our politicians and leaders to just acknowledge that this was a bad thing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=256.62s)]
*  as if we need to hear that from them still. And the thing is originally, the thought would [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=260.5s)]
*  be let them acknowledge that this is horrible. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=266.9s)]
*  Because if they understand that it's horrible, then they'll do something about it. But now [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=270.3s)]
*  we know they're not gonna do anything about it. So a lot of things need to change all [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  at once before this actually does get addressed. Because as Cenk pointed out, they know that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=279.62s)]
*  this is a problem and they don't care. They're not gonna do anything about it. They've shown [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=284.18s)]
*  us that for the last 20 years. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so last couple of things here. Look, I'm far left on this issue, which means that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=290.82s)]
*  I'm right in the center of the globe. The rest of the world thinks we're all nuts for [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=297.3s)]
*  how much we allow guns in this country. So I would let you have a gun, but you'd have [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=301.9s)]
*  to have it in a locker, not in your home. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  I know a lot of people will be like, you're crazy. And by the way, I know that'll never [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=308.9s)]
*  pass in America, right? At least in my lifetime, I would be shocked if that passed in America. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=312.62s)]
*  But that's the position I'm for, cuz that's the position that works. That's the position [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=317.26s)]
*  that's gotten Japan to about zero gun homicides. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=320.67999999999995s)]
*  But apparently, the American people are willing to accept tens of thousands of gun homicides [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  and suicides, by the way. And so look, and that leads to the last thing. There are a [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=329.26000000000005s)]
*  couple of things that the American people do agree on, right? So universal background [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  checks, over 90% of gun owners are in favor of that, because they don't plan to commit [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=339.82000000000005s)]
*  a crime with their gun. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=343.82000000000005s)]
*  So they're like, I don't mind if you have my serial number, etc. That's just very logical [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=344.86s)]
*  for us to be able to track criminals. The second is red flag laws. So if someone is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=348.70000000000005s)]
*  problematic, either they're a clear criminal or they have significant mental health issues, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=355.0s)]
*  should we take their guns away? Of course, of course. And a giant percentage of Americans [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=360.32s)]
*  agree with that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=365.36s)]
*  There's some folks who are in the gun absolutists who are like, yeah, no, if you're mentally [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=367.12s)]
*  insane, I think you should have a new Z. Okay, but most Americans don't agree with that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=371.44s)]
*  So you know my political philosophy. Take the ones where you could find them. We should [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=376.8s)]
*  fight super hard for universal background checks and for red flag laws. And then work [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=380.88s)]
*  through the decades to get, if we can convince the American people to get to my position [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=387.64s)]
*  on this, I think we'll save tens of thousands of lives. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  But that's not the place to start right now, because right now that position is not popular [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=398.28s)]
*  enough to win, right? So but for God's sake, let's at least do something to mitigate the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=403.47999999999996s)]
*  nonstop disaster of mass shootings in America. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so this is still a developing story. We'll hopefully have more information on it [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  later. But again, I'm not looking, I'm not holding my breath for any information regarding [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=419.08s)]
*  any kind of legislation that would come out of this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPCWRErZz00&t=423.72s)]
