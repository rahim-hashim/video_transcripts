The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Sean O'Brien REVEALS If Trump Asked Him For A Quid Pro Quo
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o)
*  Was Donald Trump willing to listen to your recommendation for Labor Secretary as a result [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=0.0s)]
*  of your willingness to speak at the Republican National Convention? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  You know, that's what's funny. We never ever had a conversation about anything at the IRNC [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  if Donald Trump won the election. This clearly after he won the election, we knew who candidates [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=18.32s)]
*  or we knew people that were jockeying for the Secretary of Labor position. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=25.44s)]
*  They were pro-business, big business, big anti-union law firms, and we had to be proactive. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=29.04s)]
*  And that's what people don't see. They can write whatever they want online. They can attack the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=34.8s)]
*  Teamsters Union. They can attack me personally for supporting her. But the reality of it is there [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=39.84s)]
*  was no better choice. And that's why we lobbied hard. We had some frank conversations with the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=44.96s)]
*  President of the United States. And we're very, very thankful and hopeful of the outcome. And [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=52.4s)]
*  also hopefully she will get support from her Republican colleagues despite what Rand Paul's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=59.28s)]
*  of the world is saying. And the Democrats will not use this as a political pawn just to say no. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=66.0s)]
*  This could be something good. This could be something great. This could help revitalize [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=72.8s)]
*  the broken system, the bureaucracy at the DOL and also at the NLRB. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=79.44s)]
*  And it could actually demonstrate a bipartisan approach to representing working people and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=84.64s)]
*  doing what's right by American workers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=90.4s)]
*  So let's get into that speech because I loved it, but you received a massive amount of backlash [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=91.92s)]
*  from the left over your decision to speak at the RNC. You were a keynote speaker on the first night [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=97.76s)]
*  of the Republican National Convention. And I thought honestly it was fantastic, mostly because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=102.56s)]
*  it was the type of speech that you would never expect at the RNC. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=107.68s)]
*  In fact, I wanna show the audience just a little piece of it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=111.68s)]
*  The labor law must be reformed. Americans vote for a union but can never get a union contract. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=113.84s)]
*  Companies, fire workers who try to join unions and hide behind toothless laws [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=122.0s)]
*  that are meant to protect working people but are manipulated to benefit corporations. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  This is economic terrorism at its best. An individual cannot withstand such an assault. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=131.92s)]
*  Under our current system, massive companies like Amazon, Uber, Lyft and Walmart take zero [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=139.28s)]
*  responsibilities for the workers they employ. These companies offer no real health insurance, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=146.0s)]
*  no retirement benefits, no pay leave, relying on underfunded public assistance. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=152.0s)]
*  It's- [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=157.6s)]
*  Sean, a friend of mine named Vincent who's actually a teamster [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=158.16s)]
*  wanted me to ask you, how do you maintain your backbone? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=162.72s)]
*  Hey, listen, we grew up in Boston. We got thick skin and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=167.44s)]
*  as I say a lot of times, we don't sweat most. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=172.0s)]
*  I love it. But look, you paid a price for sending that incredible and important [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  message to the Republican Party, which you did talk about a little bit with Tucker. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=179.84s)]
*  I've got back problems from the last eight months of the knife wounds from the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=184.0s)]
*  far left of the Democratic Party. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=191.2s)]
*  So tell us a little bit more about that backlash that you suffered. Did it go further than [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=192.96s)]
*  criticism? I'm super curious about that. Well, it's like anything else. I mean, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=199.6s)]
*  we stand by our decision. We made the decision based upon the input of our membership, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=204.32s)]
*  which is important. And we stand by our decision not to endorse. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=208.96s)]
*  And look, the far left, they got nasty. They were tweeting, they were or X-ing, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=214.4s)]
*  whatever it's called now. They're on social media attacking the teamsters union, attacking [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=221.84s)]
*  me personally. But at the end of the day, we made the decision. We made the right decision. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=226.56s)]
*  We stand by our decision. And I think instead of looking to blame people for the outcome, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=232.08s)]
*  like the teamsters union and myself of this election, I think the far left and some of these [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=238.8s)]
*  Democratic politicians, not all of them, because there are a lot of Democrats out there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  They're recognized that the old Democratic Party that used to embrace labor, they used to fight for [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=247.36s)]
*  labor has actually become the Republican Party that they despise at once. Getting in bed with big [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=254.0s)]
*  tech, big business, big farmer. So I don't regret any decision. And I think instead of pointing [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=262.16s)]
*  fingers right now, I think people should be looking in the mirror like, look, I, as a union leader, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  I suffer some defeats along the way. We lose organizing campaigns. Sometimes we don't get [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=276.32000000000005s)]
*  the best contract we need. And the first thing we do is self-reflect. What could we have done [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=282.24s)]
*  different? What could we have done better? We don't look to blame other people. And I think [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  that's what the Democratic Party has to do right now. Not all of them, but some of them, especially [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=290.56s)]
*  some influential people, to say, look, we blew this. We can't blame anybody else. We've got to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=295.36s)]
*  acknowledge that we made some missteps. We discounted the support of people like rank and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=301.2s)]
*  file members and unions, who I think on the average would probably vote 65%. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=308.24s)]
*  Despite what their leadership was advocating for. And I think they've lost touch with American [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=312.8s)]
*  workers. I think they need to get back in the trenches with their constituency, get into the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=319.76s)]
*  neighborhoods and talk to the people. And the Democrats during this election process [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  were very critical of anybody that went against them. Very critical of anybody that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=329.92s)]
*  didn't follow their marching orders. And look, the one thing that working people and myself [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=336.88s)]
*  alike, we don't like to be told what to do. We like to be asked what our opinions are, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  because our opinions matter. Our opinions allow them to serve us. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=348.16s)]
*  And I always want to remind people that whether Republican, Democrat or independent, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=352.0s)]
*  if you're fortunate enough to get elected, you've got to remember who you work for and who you serve. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=356.16s)]
*  You're not supposed to be serving big tech, big farm or big corporations. You're supposed to be [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  serving the neighborhood, the constituents you represent. So there's an opportunity for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=364.8s)]
*  the Democrats to reset and refocus on who they represent. But there's also an opportunity for [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=368.88s)]
*  Republicans who had a pretty strong narrative of how they wanna support working people and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=374.56s)]
*  working families agenda. They have an opportunity to prove that as well. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=378.88s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen a few examples of Republican lawmakers who don't just talk the talk. They're [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=381.92s)]
*  pursuing legislation that actually would help ordinary Americans, in some cases, specifically [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=388.24s)]
*  labor unions and things like that. Senator Josh Hawley was recently part of a Senate hearing in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=394.0s)]
*  regard to credit card companies screwing over the American people. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=399.44s)]
*  And I love the fact that he wants to take them to task. And it was something that I didn't really [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=403.76s)]
*  expect in the Republican Party at all. I also didn't expect as someone who was a lifelong [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  Democrat, I'm now a registered independent, that the Democratic Party would devolve into whatever [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=414.0s)]
*  it is now. I mean, I don't even know what the identity of the Democratic Party is anymore. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=420.8s)]
*  And it's kind of difficult to stomach it because I think they've been kind of relying on [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=426.64s)]
*  the pro-union past of the Democratic Party. But I think that's kind of run out of fumes at this [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=434.8s)]
*  point. Yes, Joe Biden appointed a few good NLRB members. Sure, he rhetorically said he wanted to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=441.44s)]
*  pursue things that would make it easier for workers to unionize but didn't really fight for it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=449.44s)]
*  At the end of the day, when push comes to shove, I don't really see a lot of action from the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=453.76s)]
*  Democratic Party in regard to bettering working conditions, making it easier for workers to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=457.36s)]
*  organize their workplaces. A lot of talk about the Pro Act, but really no fight among the Democratic [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=463.52s)]
*  Party or members of the Democratic Party to get that legislation passed. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=470.32s)]
*  And I'm curious why you think the party has kind of shed its pro-worker identity. What do you think [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=474.32s)]
*  is at the root of that issue? Well, it's big donors, big corporations. Like I said earlier, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=482.56s)]
*  they've become what they've despised, what they've accused the Republican Party of. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=491.92s)]
*  I mean, you look at who ran Kamala Harris's campaign, right? Her finance director was [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=496.16s)]
*  UberLift. They are gig economy, independent contractor model that we fight all the time. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=502.88s)]
*  And that RNC speech that I gave that you referenced, remember when I first got on stage, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=508.56s)]
*  I was getting all kinds of applause. As soon as I started speaking the truth about corporate [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=514.0s)]
*  America, corporate elitist, that applause diminished. I would have gave that same exact speech [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=518.64s)]
*  at the DNC because although there'd be different names and different titles, it would be the same [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=525.68s)]
*  same billionaires, different companies sitting in that audience as well. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=533.04s)]
*  So that speech would have been specific for both parties. And that's what we're dealing with. And [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=537.92s)]
*  that's why the Democrats have lost sight. And look, I have faith that if people are really [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=542.9599999999999s)]
*  convinced and people really have an appetite to go back to the way it was as far as who they [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=548.56s)]
*  represented, what they stood for, anything can be fixed. But my bigger focus right now [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  is working bipartisan to get things done. The last four years, there has been no dialogue [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=561.92s)]
*  across the aisle. A lot of legislation like the Pro Act and other pro worker legislation [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=567.92s)]
*  was kind of used as a pawn in the grand scheme of things. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's throw the Pro Act out there six months before in its form that no one agreed with on [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=578.72s)]
*  the other side. Let's just throw it out there just to get the Republicans to say no, so that we can [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=584.16s)]
*  point our finger and say, see, they're not for the workers. Instead of working the previous four [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=589.6s)]
*  years to say, all right, great, this is what we need to do. We wanna work together on this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=594.16s)]
*  What works for you? What can you accept in a version of the Pro Act? What can't you live with? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=598.72s)]
*  And that's what negotiations are all about. I do it every single day. I negotiate with companies [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=603.44s)]
*  every single day and trying to get a resolution that works for each side. That shouldn't be any [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=607.6s)]
*  different than what goes on every single day on the Hill. And look, let's not lose sight of the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=614.64s)]
*  fact that we talk about the Pro Act. Now, in 2008, 2009, we had a Democratic president, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=620.08s)]
*  a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate majority. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=629.04s)]
*  We sure did. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=631.68s)]
*  And our biggest goal, when I say our, labor, its biggest goal was to get the employee free choice [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=632.4s)]
*  passed. And who fought hard against it? Big corporations, big tech, the same people that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=639.36s)]
*  the Democrats have embraced, and we still couldn't get something passed. So obviously that thought [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=646.32s)]
*  process and that mentality has got to change. And we've got an opportunity to do it right now, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  to work across the aisle and get something done. Not for a Democrat, Republican, independent, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=657.36s)]
*  but for the American worker. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=663.04s)]
*  Yeah, and might I add that when Obama came into office, his first two years, not only was he in [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=664.64s)]
*  charge, he had a super majority in Congress. I mean, a filibuster proof Senate. And it really [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=670.88s)]
*  does go to show you that the little tricks that they do, like with the Pro Act, isn't because [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  the majority of Democratic lawmakers support the Pro Act. They know it's not gonna pass. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=685.04s)]
*  They're just doing this little trick to give the illusion that they're all on board with the Pro Act. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=690.0s)]
*  While the Republicans aren't. But I mean, whenever there's an opportunity to pass [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=694.48s)]
*  legislation, when the ball is in the Democrats court, there's always the bad cops, right? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  The people who are willing to raise their hands and say, nah, I have a problem with this legislation. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=705.84s)]
*  During Biden's term, Manchin and Sinema in the Senate were the ones willing to raise their hands [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=710.4s)]
*  and go against Biden's alleged agenda. And I say alleged because he didn't really fight for it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=717.12s)]
*  It's hard for me to buy that he was in favor of his own agenda when he was so [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=722.48s)]
*  tepid in promoting it and fighting for it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK0Yo4w04o&t=726.4s)]
