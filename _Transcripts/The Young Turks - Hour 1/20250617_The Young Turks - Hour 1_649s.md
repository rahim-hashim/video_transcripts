"The ‚ÄúBig, Beautiful‚Äù budget bill backed by President Donald Trump is a polling loser ‚Äî two new surveys show.
A poll published by the Washington Post Tuesday shows just 23 percent of Americans support the legislation, while 42 percent oppose it. The good news from the poll for Trump ‚Äî if there is any ‚Äî is that a large segment of the populous is still on the fence, as 34 percent say they have no opinion about the bill."

# Everyone Hates Trump's HEINOUS Big, Beautiful Bill
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg)
*  It's so obvious, isn't it amazing how much mainstream media has brainwashed the American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=0.0s)]
*  people and lied to you your whole lives? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=5.24s)]
*  Of course, give people what they want instead of what the elites want. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=6.96s)]
*  It's called the one big beautiful bill and it will be the biggest bill ever passed in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  our country since, country since. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=15.56s)]
*  It will include the biggest tax cuts, regulation cuts, military supremacy and just about everything [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=20.56s)]
*  else. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  We've got more than $1 trillion in wasteful and unnecessary spending. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=28.56s)]
*  We will end inflation, slash prices, raise wages. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=32.56s)]
*  I'm rarely really surprised when I look at polling data, I look at it every day. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=37.0s)]
*  But the amount of disapproval for this bill, holy cow, my goodness gracious. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=41.48s)]
*  All right, well despite Trump's attempts to sell his big beautiful budget bill to the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  American people, it seems that most Americans actually hate it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=53.32s)]
*  So we're gonna hear all about it now from CNN's Harry Enton and he's always fun. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=57.6s)]
*  The new KFF survey finds that Americans generally not so in favor of the bill with nearly two [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  thirds of the American public expressing their disapproval. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=68.84s)]
*  We're talking about 29 points underwater on the net favorable rating. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=71.56s)]
*  But that matches the Quinnipiac University poll from last week when it was 26 points [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=75.08s)]
*  underwater. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  My God, you need Greg Louganis to get that far underwater. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  And I mean, we're talking about a negative 41 net favorability rating among independents [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=84.32s)]
*  in the center of the electorate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  You rarely ever see pieces of legislation or proposed pieces of legislation as unpopular [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  as this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  But here you see it in two polls, 26 points underwater and 29 points underwater, no good. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  No good. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=103.72s)]
*  So in addition to the KFF poll, another poll published by the Washington Post today shows [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=104.72s)]
*  to the tax and spending legislation and mixed opinions on specific provisions. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=110.96s)]
*  So you can see here House Republicans budget bill has nearly twice as many opponents as [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=115.96s)]
*  supporters, though many have no opinion. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  So even among Republicans, you can see barely half of them support the bill. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  And you'll also notice that 19% of Dems have no opinion on the bill. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=128.14s)]
*  That number is doubled among Republicans. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=132.82s)]
*  So I don't know if that means they're just not paying as close attention to what's going [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=134.44s)]
*  on, or maybe the media they consume isn't talking about the bill, or maybe they just [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=138.06s)]
*  don't want to speak out against their party and the administration. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=141.98s)]
*  But let's look at how Americans actually feel about the specific policies in the bill. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=146.14s)]
*  Here are the areas that show a majority of support. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  So things that Americans like about the budget bill, they support increasing the child tax [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  extending tax cuts for single incomes under 100K and also between 100 and 200K, supporting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=161.7s)]
*  eliminating taxes on tips and extending tax cuts. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=168.5s)]
*  I already said that one. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  Requiring low income childless adults under 65 to prove that they're working or disabled [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  to get Medicaid, extending the 2017 federal tax cuts for everyone and extending the electric [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=179.73999999999998s)]
*  vehicle tax credit. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=185.78s)]
*  So conversely, here's a look of what they oppose. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=187.94s)]
*  So the majority opposes repealing some loan forgiveness programs. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=192.5s)]
*  They oppose increasing military spending by $150 billion. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=196.58s)]
*  They oppose spending $50 billion on the border wall between the US and Mexico. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=200.94s)]
*  They oppose ending tax breaks for clean energy and extending tax cuts for corporations and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  extending tax cuts for single incomes over 400K. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=211.1s)]
*  And they oppose spending $45 billion on migrant detention centers and reducing federal funding [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=215.06s)]
*  for food assistance programs. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=220.98s)]
*  So as you can see, some of the most decisive parts of the bill are with regard to the size [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=222.82s)]
*  and scope of cuts to entitlement programs. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  And an interesting thing that this poll uncovered, which is bad news for Trump, and we sort of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=230.78s)]
*  alluded to it earlier, is that the more people learn about this bill, the less they like [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=235.66s)]
*  it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=240.38s)]
*  So most people are not very aware of the legislation and among those who have heard about the bill, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=241.58s)]
*  it is unpopular. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=247.22s)]
*  About two thirds of the public say they have heard either little or nothing about the bill. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=248.82000000000002s)]
*  Those who have heard a great deal or a good amount about it oppose it by roughly two to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=254.52s)]
*  one margin, 64% to 33% with nearly half strongly in opposition. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=259.18s)]
*  Well, of course, people haven't heard enough about the bill. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=264.94s)]
*  It seems like half of our representatives who voted to pass the bill in the House haven't [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=268.74s)]
*  even read the bill. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=273.14s)]
*  So how could the public, especially Republican voters, be expected to be educated on it? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=274.3s)]
*  Cenk, do you think that we as voters have a responsibility to stay informed on matters [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=279.46000000000004s)]
*  like this one? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=284.66s)]
*  Like the details and contents of such a huge spending bill, especially when our own representatives [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  are themselves not informed? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=291.7s)]
*  Or is there just nothing we can do about it now since there's no immediately upcoming [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=293.42s)]
*  election? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=297.54s)]
*  It feels like the representatives who have openly admitted that they had not read the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=298.62s)]
*  bill before they voted on it, they're just not afraid of any consequences for admitting [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  that much, just the fact that they haven't read it to their constituents. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so look, independent media is the answer. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=311.70000000000005s)]
*  Because all my life, mainstream media has been giant liars. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  They never tell you what the American people actually want. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=319.38s)]
*  They tell you what the elites want and pretend that the American people want it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  And this poll shows you exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=324.94s)]
*  And I'm going to give you productive answers as to what we should do in a second as well. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=327.38s)]
*  But first, as to how badly this poll, this bill is doing right now. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=333.5s)]
*  Guys, 17% of independents approve. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=337.82s)]
*  If you're a Republican, you can make any excuse you like. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=340.94s)]
*  If you're a MAGA and you love the bill, okay, go ahead. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=343.5s)]
*  But 17% of independents is a disaster. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=347.14000000000004s)]
*  And we're a fair show. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=350.62s)]
*  We're not one of these partisan hacks. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=351.82s)]
*  Our side is great, your side is terrible, right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=354.14000000000004s)]
*  So no, when Joe Biden was in the low 30s with independence, I came on the show in 2023 and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=356.34s)]
*  said he cannot recover. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=363.21999999999997s)]
*  You can't be this low with independence and win an election. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=365.14s)]
*  I mean, the age is super relevant. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=368.38s)]
*  But whether it's the age or anything else, the juries come in. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=370.56s)]
*  You can't be this low with independence. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=373.34s)]
*  And so that's what I'm telling you, Republicans. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=375.78s)]
*  Now, it doesn't mean the bill is not going to pass because almost everyone in Congress [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=377.29999999999995s)]
*  is a crook. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  And they can't wait to give themselves tax breaks, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=381.78s)]
*  Let alone deregulation all the other goodies in here for corporations that are all of their [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=384.66s)]
*  donors, it'll pass. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=388.38s)]
*  But Republicans, if later the country holds it against you, don't be surprised. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=390.3s)]
*  They told you ahead of time they don't want the damn bill. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=396.02s)]
*  Now when you get into the details, that shows you exactly what the American people do and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=398.58s)]
*  don't want, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=403.94s)]
*  So yeah, I was ready to, but I just want to focus on a couple of things here. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=405.3s)]
*  Child tax credits, what do we tell you about Biden? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=409.7s)]
*  We said, when he put that in for a year in the beginning of his term for the COVID relief [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=411.96s)]
*  bill, it was the single most popular thing that he did. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=417.28s)]
*  And when he took it away, that's when his ratings started to decline. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=420.2s)]
*  And we said, my God, no fight for the child tax credit. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=424.0s)]
*  And progressives in Congress said, no, trust Biden. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  And of course, the corporate Democrats were like, we don't really want to do it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=429.76s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=433.84s)]
*  Our donors don't want that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=434.84s)]
*  Anyway, where is it? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=436.0s)]
*  Look, that's the number one provision in the bill at 72% approval. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=437.0s)]
*  Told you, why? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=441.2s)]
*  Because it's not complicated. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=442.2s)]
*  Look at the others, right? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=443.2s)]
*  Ending tax cuts for people making under $100,000, 71%. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=445.68s)]
*  Eliminating taxes on tips for people who are middle class and work at 65%. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  Those are the most popular provisions in the bill, why? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  Because they go to you, obvious. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=458.24s)]
*  It's so obvious. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=460.28s)]
*  Isn't it amazing how much mainstream media has brainwashed the American people and lied [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=461.28s)]
*  to you your whole lives? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=465.68s)]
*  Of course, give people what they want instead of what the elites want. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=466.84s)]
*  Now, what are the mainstream media always says, people love tax cuts. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=470.88s)]
*  No, they like tax cuts for people making under $100,000. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=474.24s)]
*  Do they like tax cuts for people making above $500,000 or $400,000? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=478.08s)]
*  Good news, it's in the poll. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=483.76s)]
*  Let's look, ending tax cuts for single incomes above $400,000. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=485.52s)]
*  Deeply unpopular at 29% at the bottom. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=490.52s)]
*  Nobody and I've told you this 100 times, I wrote it in my book, Justice is Coming. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  76% of the country in almost every poll says raise taxes on the rich. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=500.24s)]
*  Don't lower them, raise taxes. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=506.44s)]
*  That's three quarters of the country. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=508.12s)]
*  How many times have you heard that on CNN or even MSNBC? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=509.12s)]
*  My guess is zero. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=513.32s)]
*  They're in the top. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=516.0s)]
*  They all make about $400,000. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=517.4s)]
*  They're lying to you. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=519.4s)]
*  Okay, so how about the $45 billion for migrant detention centers? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=520.4s)]
*  Magna thinks people want migrant detention centers. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=525.0400000000001s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=527.72s)]
*  24% approval, okay? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=528.76s)]
*  How about reducing food assistance? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=531.12s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to take food away from them so we can give tax cuts to people making above [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=533.4s)]
*  400,000. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=537.84s)]
*  People love that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  No, they hate it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  The single least popular provision in the bill at 23%. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=540.9200000000001s)]
*  Because you know why? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=544.76s)]
*  The American people are decent human beings. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=546.4s)]
*  They don't want you to take money and food out of the mouths of hungry children and give [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=549.0s)]
*  it to the richest people in the country. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=556.22s)]
*  And guys, the tax cut that goes to people making above $500,000 a year is valued at [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=558.8199999999999s)]
*  least $1.1 trillion. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=564.74s)]
*  Cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, $1.1 trillion. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=567.98s)]
*  They are very literally stealing from the poor and the middle class and giving it to [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=573.06s)]
*  the richest people. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=577.22s)]
*  And that's why this bill is 29, 26 points underwater, deeply unpopular. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=578.58s)]
*  Only 70% of independents support it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=584.2199999999999s)]
*  This bill sucks and the American people hate it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=586.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I just want to say real quick that Senate Republicans are now scrambling [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=590.5799999999999s)]
*  to get this thing passed by the July 4th deadline. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=595.26s)]
*  So we're in for a very interesting Independence Day. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=598.4599999999999s)]
*  But there is some hope that they'll at least amend some things in the bill before it gets [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=602.28s)]
*  passed. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=606.38s)]
*  There does seem to be some opposition from the Republican side that could stifle its [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=607.38s)]
*  passing. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=611.42s)]
*  But they're not gonna get rid of those tax cuts. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=612.5799999999999s)]
*  Everything this administration has done this far for the past few months has been in service [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=615.3399999999999s)]
*  of these tax cuts. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  Everything we've seen with Trump, everything we've seen with Elon and Doge, it has been [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=621.6999999999999s)]
*  to get the rich their tax cuts. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=625.54s)]
*  And it's a very specific number that they're after. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=627.66s)]
*  They're not gonna give it up. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=630.0999999999999s)]
*  They're not even gonna budge from that number. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=631.14s)]
*  So either way, the American people are gonna have to deal with it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=633.24s)]
*  And hopefully the Republican party will have to deal with the consequences of what they've [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=635.9799999999999s)]
*  done to the American people come midterms. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEko7hzqxJg&t=640.32s)]
