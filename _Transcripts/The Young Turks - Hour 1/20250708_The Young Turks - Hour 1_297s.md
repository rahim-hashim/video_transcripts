# Cancun Cruz Strikes AGAIN!
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8)
*  Cancun Cruz strikes again cuz you guys know how much I love to talk about Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=0.0s)]
*  So following the tragedy in Kerrville, Texas over the holiday weekend, Texas Senator Ted Cruz was [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=5.12s)]
*  once again missing in action. But not only was he missing in action, he says he returned to Texas [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=10.48s)]
*  as quickly as possible once he heard the news of deadly flash flooding in the Texas Hill country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=16.48s)]
*  But new reporting actually suggests otherwise. So Ted was on vacation with his wife in Athens, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=22.64s)]
*  Greece over the holiday weekend. And this was just a day after the Guadalupe River in Texas [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=28.72s)]
*  rapidly rose and flooded the surrounding area. And Ted Cruz was spotted touring the Parthenon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=34.32s)]
*  Someone saw him there and told the Daily Beast, quote, he was with his family and a lone security [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=40.08s)]
*  guard. As he walked past us, I simply said 20 kids dead in Texas and you take a vacation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=45.76s)]
*  He sort of grunted and walked on. His wife shot me a dirty look. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=51.68s)]
*  Then they continued on with their tour guide. Meanwhile, emergency workers in Texas were [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=55.68s)]
*  desperately searching for 20 campers who went missing in the flood. I think the current death [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=62.0s)]
*  toll right now is up to 109 people, last I checked. The flood has turned out to be one of the deadliest [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=67.36s)]
*  floods in over a century. So this interaction, while embarrassing for Ted, also disproves the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  claim from his own office that he returned to Texas following the news of the flood, quote, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  as fast as humanly possible. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=84.0s)]
*  Flight records also indicate that there were several earlier flights that Ted could have been [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=86.88s)]
*  on flying from Athens to San Antonio. Of course, this story is making headlines now because [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=91.36s)]
*  not being there for Texans is kind of the thing that Ted Cruz does these days, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=101.2s)]
*  It's like his thing now. He's making a pattern of it. And the thing that he and his supporters [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=106.4s)]
*  love to say is, what could he have done even if he was there? Well, since Ted has been home, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=111.04s)]
*  Ted has appeared on Fox News to discuss the flood from Kerrville. And he's been on the phone trying [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  to get support for the affected community and also from the president. So he is doing something now [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=122.64s)]
*  that he is back in Texas. But there's a few different angles here, Cenk. The most obvious [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=129.28s)]
*  is that, let's be fair to Ted Cruz, right? There's no way that he could have known what was [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=134.72s)]
*  going to happen in Texas while he happened to already be away. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=139.76s)]
*  This is not the same as when he left Texas in the middle of a disaster. That was extra bad, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=143.12s)]
*  But without taking away from the tragedy itself, there seems to be two different responses whenever [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=150.32s)]
*  something like this happens. There's the actual government response to the crisis whenever it [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=156.48s)]
*  happens. And then there's the response to the response, right? The response to the tragedy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  And while sometimes you can argue that the latter takes away from the former, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  the latter is also a very important part of holding our elected officials accountable. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  So now the question becomes, is Ted Cruz actually a good leader? And do the good people of Texas [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=175.76s)]
*  deserve better than Ted Cruz, even if maybe they don't realize it yet? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=181.04s)]
*  Yeah, so first off, he is a little bit unlucky with the vacations. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=185.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  And it reminded me of Karen Bass a little bit. And so I thought people were a little unfair to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=192.32s)]
*  her about the Ghana trip, a little unfair here. On the other hand, they do have to hurry back. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=197.92s)]
*  I mean, when your town's on fire, you should hurry back. Or your town or your state is flooded, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=203.28s)]
*  you should hurry back. And there is empirical evidence that he didn't hurry back because [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=208.0s)]
*  the guy at the Parthenon said 20 kids are dead already in Texas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=212.64s)]
*  So if the other tourists knew, well, certainly Ted Cruz knew and should have known and should [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  have gotten his ass back to Texas, right? And chose not to. Then the last part of it is, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=224.55999999999997s)]
*  I mean, a natural disaster versus your wife. Which one are you going to pick? Which one are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=230.72s)]
*  you going to side with? Does that get a sense that she's not happy when he leaves the vacations [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  early? So tough situation for Ted, but it's literally impossible to have any sympathy for him [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=244.08s)]
*  on anything. Yeah, I will reserve all of my sympathy for the victims and for their families. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  It's very sad what's happened over there. The Guadalupe River, the Guadalupe, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=256.32s)]
*  that's a very popular tourist destination during the summer. A lot of Texans flock there from [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=261.44s)]
*  Dallas, Houston, wherever. I floated on that river so many times. It's a good time. It's very sad [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=266.08s)]
*  what's happened over there. And I hate to be like thoughts and prayers, but like, yeah, I really [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=271.35999999999996s)]
*  hope that something comes through for these people. And there's a lot of ways to volunteer [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=276.4s)]
*  to help them. And Ted Cruz could probably take a hint from some of those people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the only good news about him not rushing back is it's not like Ted Cruz [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  was going to make a difference. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmGoyOMOIP8&t=293.2s)]
