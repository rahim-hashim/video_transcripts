TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Trump Admin Trying HARD To Spin What Happened with Zelensky
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4)
*  I don't think anybody had any idea that Zelensky would be so impertinent, so disrespectful, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=0.0s)]
*  so insulting to the United States of America. But this is one of the great moments in the history [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=7.12s)]
*  of American diplomacy. The way that President Trump and JD Vance stood up for American interests in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=12.56s)]
*  the world stage. The way that President Trump defended Americans after years of being fleeced [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=19.2s)]
*  and abused and taken advantage of and taken for granted. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=26.08s)]
*  Millions of American hearts swelled with overflowing pride today to watch President Trump [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  put Zelensky in his place. Is that really the case? I mean, having a grown man demand that a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  president who didn't flee his country after it was invaded, say he's thankful over and over again. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  That doesn't really inspire strength, right? That doesn't communicate strength to me. But [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=52.96s)]
*  nonetheless, there you have White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller laying it on real [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=57.44s)]
*  thick following the brawl President Trump and JD Vance had with Ukrainian President [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=62.88s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky. Yeah, I actually think that there are two ways to see what happened there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=68.56s)]
*  And I understand what the right wing is saying. I certainly understand what the left wing is saying [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=74.0s)]
*  as well. And I'll tell you where I come out on. But I understand why Miller is making those [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=78.32s)]
*  comments. A lot of right wingers are looking at that and going absolutely right on, brother. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=82.32s)]
*  I get it. But anyway, I think a lot of what Vance engaged in was performative. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=86.63999999999999s)]
*  I don't think it looks strong to demand a thank you over and over again when Zelensky has been [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=92.72s)]
*  thankful and has been clear in how thankful he is over and over again. But anyway, let's just get [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  to the details of what's going on here. So look, Miller's statements do serve as an example of how [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=103.6s)]
*  the Trump administration is kind of laundering what happened in the Oval Office last Friday [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=108.56s)]
*  with Zelensky kind of selling what happened to the American people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=115.84s)]
*  And are Americans buying it? Honestly, at this very moment, we don't know yet. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=119.76s)]
*  But there is some polling that I think might give us some insight into how Americans were feeling [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  just before that Oval Office meltdown. Before we get to that polling though, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=130.0s)]
*  let's just do a little refresher of what we're talking about. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=135.2s)]
*  You have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=138.55999999999997s)]
*  God bless. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=143.76s)]
*  You don't know that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=144.56s)]
*  God bless. God bless. You will not have war. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=145.28s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're gonna feel. Have you said thank you once? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of times. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=150.88s)]
*  No, in this entire meeting, you said thank you. We gave you military equipment. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=152.32s)]
*  You men are brave, but they had to use our military. If you didn't have our military equipment, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=162.96s)]
*  And what if they do? What if anything? What if a bomb drops on your head right now? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=168.32s)]
*  But they have. Okay. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=172.64s)]
*  Why did they break it? This is gonna be great television. I will say that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=173.92s)]
*  Okay, so look, my view of that whole thing, Cenk, was Trump was actually pretty calm. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=177.68s)]
*  And my read was he was kind of annoyed with Vance until Zelensky made that comment about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=184.64s)]
*  how Americans will be feeling this, even though there's a great big ocean between us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=190.8s)]
*  What he was trying to say is we are part of the NATO alliance. If Russia feels emboldened enough [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  to invade Poland, for instance, one of our NATO allies, the US, based on our agreement with NATO, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=202.8s)]
*  has no choice but to put boots on the ground to defend Poland. That's what he's referring to. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=210.56s)]
*  The big ocean between us doesn't matter in that scenario, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  So I don't think Trump realized that's what he was referring to, but nonetheless, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=219.76s)]
*  that's what kind of triggered Trump. But leading up to that, I mean, it was a clown show with Vance. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=223.12s)]
*  Vance is the one who torpedoed the so-called deal. But it wasn't really much of a deal [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=228.88s)]
*  for Zelensky because there's no security guarantee. Why would you give away your natural resources [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=233.28s)]
*  for nothing in return? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so look, this has now become like the Zapruder film. And we went over it on Friday. My [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  thought on it is Zelensky asked the first question of the others. They normally address the press. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=247.92s)]
*  Zelensky's the first one to address something to JD Vance. So was he just frustrated or [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=254.0s)]
*  did he do that on purpose? I'll come back to that. Then JD Vance goes over the top. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=261.36s)]
*  Because Zelensky's question, was it aggressive? I don't know. I guess depending on your perspective. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=266.4s)]
*  But was it rude, like outright rude? Did he say call him any names or anything like that? No, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  no, it was just a relatively normal question. But it was a little aggressive to even ask a question [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=278.64s)]
*  of JD Vance in that context. Then JD Vance goes over the top. I need you to get down on your hands [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=283.2s)]
*  and knees and grovel and this and that. And he just makes the whole thing explosive, right? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=290.08s)]
*  And I agree with you, Ana, that Trump doesn't really lose it until Zelensky's saying, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=295.6s)]
*  you guys are gonna feel the pain and the ocean's not gonna protect you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=300.0s)]
*  And as soon as he said that, I was like, that's the wrong way to go. That's definitely gonna [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=302.56s)]
*  trigger Trump and then immediately trigger Trump. Because once you start talking about how we're [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=306.16s)]
*  gonna feel pain, there's no way Trump's not gonna get triggered, right? And so then if you notice, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  look, I know both sides are seeing only what they wanna see. I'm positive of that. So yes, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  the right wing sees that's a president standing up for us and say, hey, you should be grateful. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=321.12s)]
*  And finally, American interests are being protected. I see that. I know the left doesn't [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=325.76s)]
*  see that. The left says, no, just a wild man, etc. No, I see him yelling over the guy. I see [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=330.88s)]
*  him saying, I'm gonna take care of American interests. I see it, right? On the other hand, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=336.24s)]
*  and so I also see Zelensky trying to talk over Trump. That's not gonna work. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  No, well, the minute Trump starts talking in that situation, whether you like it or not, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  and no matter how painful it is, you gotta let him talk and then make your point, etc. But all of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=351.44s)]
*  that, none of that really matters. And left, I see you exactly. I'm more on the left-wing side, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=358.0s)]
*  which is, to your point, Ana, JD Vance is mainly starting in the hostilities. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  This is crazy. Our president and vice president have a responsibility to not make an ass out of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=366.88s)]
*  themselves on the world stage with one of our allies and start torpedoing our ally, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=372.16s)]
*  which hurts our leverage, makes peace less likely, not more likely. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. And that's, again, not a left-wing or right-wing position. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  All decent people here wanna drive towards peace, and they made peace a lot less likely in that room. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=386.8s)]
*  But the bottom line is what we discussed on Friday and what Ana alluded to there. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=392.56s)]
*  The whole premise was absurd. They brought the guy in saying they were gonna do security guarantees [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=396.72s)]
*  in exchange for the mineral rights. They pulled a rug out and go, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=401.12s)]
*  ha ha, we're not getting any security guarantees. And right-wing, that doesn't mean troops, guys. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=404.16s)]
*  I don't want American troops in Ukraine. You're crazy? No way, no way, right? But there's a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=408.8s)]
*  thousand other ways to do security guarantees, and we offered none of them. So why would the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=413.6s)]
*  brother give up his mineral rights? And then we spent 100 to 200, and we sent out about, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=418.08s)]
*  actually, 140 already, right? 140 billion dollars. We're asking for 500 billion in return. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=422.88s)]
*  First of all, that's an unreasonable ask. But second of all, even if you do that and they're [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=427.68s)]
*  in a super tight spot, ha ha, we got him. We screwed over our own allies and took their resources. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=432.64s)]
*  Oh, wow, we're really proud. Okay, but fine, we did all that, America first, whatever. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=438.24s)]
*  But in return, you have to give him a security guarantee. Otherwise, why the hell would he do [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=443.04s)]
*  it? Yeah, I wouldn't sign that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=447.36s)]
*  Right. I would not sign that. What's the point? Why would I give away all of my natural, or [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=448.72s)]
*  huge portion of my natural resources and get nothing in return? That makes no sense. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=453.28s)]
*  And I know what the right wing is screaming into their screens right now. No, if our companies [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=458.64s)]
*  are there, then that's kind of a security guarantee. No, it's not. Tons of our companies are in [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  Middle Eastern countries, African countries, Asian countries. Hostilities begin. You know what [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=470.0s)]
*  happens? They pause. They withdraw. We don't go to war with Myanmar or Kenya or anyone else. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  They just withdraw for a little while until things calm down and they go back. And then they [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=479.28s)]
*  keep taking all their natural resources. It's not a security guarantee at all, at all, not 1%. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=482.96s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about where Americans are on this issue. Because there was a CBS poll [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=488.56s)]
*  taken from February 26th through the 28th. That disastrous press conference took place on the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=497.44s)]
*  28th. So it probably didn't have that much of an impact on the poll results. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  But it's still worth knowing where Americans stood on the issue and how Trump's been handling [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=508.56s)]
*  it so far. So let's get into some of these details. Anyway, so here's what the poll found. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=512.96s)]
*  Let's take a look at the first graphic. Russia-Ukraine conflict, Trump's actions and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=518.64s)]
*  statements have. And so 46% of Americans believe that so far Trump has favored Russia over Ukraine, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=523.36s)]
*  46%. 43% feel that Trump has treated Russia and Ukraine equally. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=532.56s)]
*  Only 11% of respondents believe that Trump has favored Ukraine over Russia. So the majority of [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=538.64s)]
*  American respondents to this poll indicate that they feel that Trump has actually favored Russia [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  over Ukraine on this issue or in this war. And apparently Russia has the same interpretation [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  as the American people. Because a spokesperson for the Kremlin was quoted as saying that the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=558.72s)]
*  new US administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=564.96s)]
*  This largely coincides with our vision. So thought it was important context to share. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=571.36s)]
*  Let's get to the next poll question and the results. So Americans do approve of how Trump [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=577.52s)]
*  had managed the war in Ukraine by a slim majority of 51%. Now again, this poll was taken [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=584.72s)]
*  just before the Oval Office meltdown. But you take a look at it and you'll see that [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=592.24s)]
*  the polls margin of error, by the way, is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=598.4s)]
*  But nonetheless, 51% feel favorably toward Trump and how he's handled this. Let's look at the next [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=603.44s)]
*  graphic. The poll also found that another extremely slim majority of Americans, 51% again, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=609.68s)]
*  believe that the United States should send military aid to Ukraine. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=616.16s)]
*  But obviously, it really depends on how you identify politically. Democrats are far more [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=620.56s)]
*  in favor of sending military weaponry to Ukraine, 72% want to do that. Among Republicans, that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=626.64s)]
*  number drops all the way down to 32%. So look, I mean, when you really think about it, Cenk, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=633.6s)]
*  Trump is playing to his base on this issue, right? His base, the majority of his base [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=639.84s)]
*  does not want to send military aid to Ukraine anymore. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=645.12s)]
*  Yeah, so guys, there's a difference between not wanting to send military aid to Ukraine [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  and actively taking Russia's side and reducing Ukraine's leverage. So [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=654.96s)]
*  if we increase Ukraine's leverage, then Russia, which is currently, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=661.76s)]
*  I know it feels like a stalemate, but certainly without our support, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  then Russia goes back to winning and probably winning significantly. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=671.28s)]
*  So why would they want to get to peace? They would want to continue to take land, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=674.9599999999999s)]
*  especially because Trump and Vance are declaring to the whole world, the only thing we care about is [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=679.28s)]
*  the mineral rights. So Russia then goes, well, then I should take more land to take more mineral [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=684.64s)]
*  rights and I'll sell them later. And apparently, it'll be worth more than what this war is costing [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=690.8s)]
*  me. So you've given them a huge incentive to keep fighting rather than the conclusion that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=697.68s)]
*  the populist left, populist right wanted, the establishment didn't want, the Uniparty wanted [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=705.28s)]
*  this war to continue forever, right? And you're helping them by doing this insane thing where we [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=710.48s)]
*  go, okay, Ukraine started the war, we're gonna withdraw money from Ukraine. They're the ones [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=716.32s)]
*  at fault and so we won't give them any security guarantees. So Russia, they're easy pickings, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=723.84s)]
*  do whatever you like to them. And they'll be nearly defenseless. How does that help [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=729.28s)]
*  get to peace? It doesn't. Now they don't care about peace at all. The only thing they care about [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=734.64s)]
*  is the lithium in those hills. So the number one mineral there in Ukraine is lithium, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  which is what goes into the batteries in Teslas. So they're not even trying for peace anymore. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  Now they're trying to make Elon richer. Remember, the mineral rights or the oil rights never go to [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  the American people ever. It's never happened. It goes to American corporations. Which ones? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  The ones that are most closely connected to the government. That is exactly what's happened with [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=765.36s)]
*  oil rights for the last 75 years. And that's exactly what's gonna happen with these mineral [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=769.6s)]
*  rights. You know what though, Cenk, thank God that we're transitioning over to electric vehicles, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=774.32s)]
*  which we still don't have the infrastructure for. But hey, we're combating climate change [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  and making the world a better place by, wait. Anyway, let's go to the next graphic, because [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=782.32s)]
*  we'll end with yet another slim majority here. According to the same CBS News poll, 52% of [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=789.0400000000001s)]
*  Americans support Ukraine in its war against Russia, but 44% of Americans say that they are [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=796.64s)]
*  neutral. Only 4% of Americans support Russia over Ukraine. Now look, many of those numbers have [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=801.92s)]
*  changed significantly since President Joe Biden was in office. And CNN's Harry Enton is about to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=808.24s)]
*  explain how. You look at Joe Biden back in 2024. He was 22 points underwater. Holy cow. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=815.76s)]
*  You look at Donald Trump, it's just a different planet entirely. I mean, the gulf between these [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=822.48s)]
*  two is wider than the gulf of America or Mexico, depending on which side of the aisle you stand on. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=827.36s)]
*  He's at plus two Americans on the Russia-Ukraine war. One a quicker end of the war, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=831.2s)]
*  but Russia keeps its captured land. Look at this, 50%, 50%. Bare majority, bare majority coming in [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=835.52s)]
*  here. Support Ukraine's right to fight, even if it means a longer war. That's at 48. This is very, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=841.52s)]
*  very close. But the trend line on this question is so important, because that one a quick end of the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=847.12s)]
*  war. Look at this. You go back to August of 2022, it was at 31%. Now we're at 50%. I mean, that is a [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=851.76s)]
*  rocket ship upwards in terms of the Americans who want a quick end to the war, even if it means [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=859.28s)]
*  Russia keeps the captured Ukraine land. Americans who say Russia is an enemy, you go back to 2023, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=863.92s)]
*  it was 64%. And that CBS News YouGov poll, it was down to 34%. Now there is a chunk that believes [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=869.12s)]
*  that Russia is an unfriendly nation, but the percentage who believe that they're either an [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=875.52s)]
*  ally or friendly, that's up to 34% as well. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=878.96s)]
*  Look, the notion that Russia is a friend or ally is hilarious to me. I've never bought into that. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=881.52s)]
*  I would never even be tempted to believe that. But I will say this. I can understand, Cenk, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=888.96s)]
*  why there is this itch to end the war, regardless of what happens to Ukraine. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=894.72s)]
*  I don't fall into that camp, but I'm also very empathetic to those who are tired of seeing their [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=899.68s)]
*  tax dollars get funneled to foreign conflicts or to corporations for subsidies. The quality of life [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=905.44s)]
*  for Americans continues to get worse year after year. So I know that that's likely what is [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=912.72s)]
*  motivating the way Americans are feeling in regard to this war and whether or not we continue [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=920.24s)]
*  supporting Ukraine. I just think everything that we saw in the Oval Office last Friday [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=925.2800000000001s)]
*  literally just ends the possibility of a real peace deal. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=931.2s)]
*  And it's also become clear to me that the Trump administration isn't really interested in a peace [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=936.48s)]
*  deal. They just wanna pull out. They don't wanna have anything to do with this war, but they wanna [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=941.2800000000001s)]
*  see if they can maybe benefit from natural resources from Ukraine while they're at it. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the only slight difference I would have there, Ana, is that I think that they don't really care [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=950.32s)]
*  one way or another if we have peace or war. The only thing that's going through Trump and [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=956.8s)]
*  Musk's mind is money, money, money, money, money, money, money, right? And if it turns out that they [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=961.8399999999999s)]
*  thought they could make more money from the military industrial complex by prolonging the war, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=966.4s)]
*  then my guess is they would prolong the war. If they thought they can get to a better result [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=970.7199999999999s)]
*  with both in popularity or money by getting to peace, then they would go for peace. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=974.8s)]
*  But right now, peace or war has taken a backseat to minerals. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=978.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=982.48s)]
*  And there's no question about that. So I'm in the camp of get to peace as quickly as possible. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=982.88s)]
*  I'm also in the camp of frustrated enough that we're probably gonna have to let go of some weed. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=988.9599999999999s)]
*  The Ukraine has to let go of some land probably in this exchange. And that's super painful. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=994.72s)]
*  I don't think that that's like a thing to be flippant about, because it does encourage Russia. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1001.12s)]
*  It encourages bad actors, etc. But we're probably gonna have to get there. And I don't wanna keep [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1006.48s)]
*  spending money on it. But none of us are helped by Musk and Trump's obsession with [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1011.68s)]
*  mineral rights that have nothing to do with peace or war. It has more to do with me, me, me, me, me, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1019.68s)]
*  and the donor class getting more money out of this. They're basically saying, yeah, but [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  what's in it for Elon Musk? War or peace? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1029.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  And this is a sick way to run a government. Last is from a comment on Twitch from one of our members, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1033.2s)]
*  Funnyhandle, only dead on the inside says, is Israel going to sign 50% of its minerals to the US? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1039.44s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1045.8400000000001s)]
*  Since we give them $3 billion on weapons, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1046.3200000000002s)]
*  one day after Trump and Vance put out this disgraceful performance. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1049.2800000000002s)]
*  No, no, America is Israel's servants, okay? The American taxpayer, we're just servants for [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1052.72s)]
*  Israel's war against Palestinians. And who knows what other Arab majority country they might invade [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1059.0400000000002s)]
*  next? That's the reality, that's the reality. And Israel's Russia in that analogy. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1064.16s)]
*  They're the ones who are prolonging an endless war. And in this crazy analogy, we're not trying [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1068.64s)]
*  to help poor victims just barely survive, Ukraine or Palestinians. We're saying, Israel, please murder [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1074.72s)]
*  more of those poor innocent victims with our money. And we don't want any mineral rights, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1081.8400000000001s)]
*  we don't want anything, okay? No, how much more can we give you? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1086.4s)]
*  So I mean, you mentioned 3 billion a year, that's what we do for Israel every year, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1090.0800000000002s)]
*  never gotten a single cent back. But we gave them over $20 billion last year, where's our [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1093.44s)]
*  goddamn mineral rights? And by the way- [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1097.84s)]
*  No, when it comes to Israel, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give. So hey, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyjCnK94WF4&t=1099.6799999999998s)]
