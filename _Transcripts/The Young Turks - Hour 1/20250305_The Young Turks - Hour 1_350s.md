# Trump Lawyer Gives MIDDLE FINGER To Veterans
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI)
*  the president starting to think about maybe some of those veterans who worked for the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=0.0s)]
*  federal government and maybe what the administration can do to at least help salvage their lives? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=3.96s)]
*  Well, as you know, we care about veterans tremendously. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=8.76s)]
*  I mean, that's something the president has always cared about anybody in blue, anybody [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=10.88s)]
*  that serves this country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=14.24s)]
*  But at the same time, we have taxpayer dollars, we have a fiscal responsibility to use taxpayer [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=16.32s)]
*  dollars to pay people that actually work. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=21.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean that we forget our veterans by any means, we are going to care for them [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=23.28s)]
*  in the right way, but perhaps they're not fit to have a job at this moment or not willing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=26.32s)]
*  to come to work. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=29.84s)]
*  Where did you get your information that federal workers who also happen to be veterans aren't [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=33.56s)]
*  working and don't deserve a paycheck? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=37.64s)]
*  There you have Trump lawyer, Lena Haba, basically showing absolutely no compassion for the veterans [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=40.16s)]
*  who have lost their livelihoods as a result of Elon Musk and Doge's firings of federal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=46.64s)]
*  workers. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=53.28s)]
*  Now, clearly, she just thinks they're all lazy, they're all bums, they don't deserve [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=54.28s)]
*  a paycheck. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=57.32s)]
*  But I guess the losers in Congress who don't even work half the days in the year, who failed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=59.0s)]
*  to pass legislation and spend all of their time doing performative hearings, they deserve [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=66.16s)]
*  their paychecks? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=72.16s)]
*  Okay, but look, there is some good and surprising news today because Trump has apparently abruptly [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=73.16s)]
*  walked back his order for federal agencies to fire thousands of probationary employees. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, I wanna be clear, he didn't make this decision out of the kindness of his own heart. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=87.72s)]
*  His decision has to do a little something with the courts which found these mass firings to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=91.72s)]
*  be potentially unlawful. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  So US District Judge William Alsop ruled last Thursday that the Office of Personnel Management [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=100.52s)]
*  had no authority to order agencies to fire thousands of probationary workers and that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=106.6s)]
*  its actions were probably illegal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  So Everett Kelly of the American Federation of Government Employees actually brought this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=114.12s)]
*  suit to Alsop's court and luckily the judge ruled in his favor. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=120.12s)]
*  Now, the Office of Personnel Management's new guidance also comes after a government [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=125.72s)]
*  employee oversight board last week ruled in favor of six probationary employees who were [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  fired and who alleged that their terminations were illegal. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=137.08s)]
*  So in that case, a nonprofit known as Democracy Forward had filed the suit. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  In fact, they have filed multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=147.08s)]
*  And currently they're working to expand that decision to essentially cover all probationary [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  employees who were fired by the Trump administration. So how did Trump respond to this? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=156.44s)]
*  And by the way, guys, this is good news because he did revise his order and a big fear was that he [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=162.68s)]
*  wasn't going to respect the courts and that was going to lead to a constitutional crisis. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=170.52s)]
*  If Trump continues listening to the courts, I commend him for doing so. That is the right [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=176.2s)]
*  course of action that shows respect for our system of government and our constitution. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=181.0s)]
*  Let's just hope he keeps going in that direction. Now in revised guidance issued to the heads of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=186.04s)]
*  federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Management claims, it never actually ordered [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  actually ordered agencies to fire probationary employees. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=196.44s)]
*  Instead, OPM claims it's been up to each agency all along to decide who to fire. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=200.68s)]
*  Now here's what the revised guidance says. Please note that by this memorandum, OPM is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=208.84s)]
*  not directing agencies to take any specific performance based actions regarding probationary [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=216.12s)]
*  employees. Agencies have ultimate decision making authority over and responsibility for [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=221.48s)]
*  such personnel actions. Now for those who are wondering what does probationary mean, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=227.56s)]
*  just to let everyone know, it's newer federal workers or veterans, like people who have been [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=232.76s)]
*  working for the federal government but got promoted. Once they get promoted, what ends up [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=242.2s)]
*  happening is unfortunately they go through another probationary period. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=247.08s)]
*  So it is a mistake to assume that all of these federal workers who just got fired had only been [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  on the job for a few months. No, that's not the case. For some of them, yes, it is the case. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=257.48s)]
*  But there are a lot of federal workers who were fired even though they had just been promoted, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=262.36s)]
*  meaning that they had been doing a good job in their role and were rewarded with a promotion. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=267.48s)]
*  So it's also worth noting though that the revised guidance did not say anything about rehiring the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=274.6s)]
*  federal workers who have been let go. But the judges ruling last week has resulted in some of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=281.24s)]
*  these federal agencies essentially scrambling to rehire the individuals who were just let go. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=288.04s)]
*  So the National Science Foundation is one example. They're trying to reinstate 84 employees that they [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  fired as part of OPM's directive. One of those 84 people told HuffPost on Monday that he and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=299.64s)]
*  several of his colleagues learned they were getting their jobs back not from NSF but from [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  other coworkers and the press. So that's not a good sign at all. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=313.8s)]
*  And look, I'm happy that there are some victories here when it comes to the federal courts. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  And I'm also incredibly happy that it appears the Trump administration is listening to these [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=327.8s)]
*  rulings and actually carrying out what they are mandated to carry out based on how the federal [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=333.64000000000004s)]
*  courts weigh in on these issues. So that's a good sign. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=339.8s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=343.4s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYmNLY2-6oI&t=346.52s)]
