The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Tucker GRILLS Ted Cruz About Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc)
*  Senator Ted Cruz is getting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=0.0s)]
*  interviewed by Tucker Carlson, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=1.5s)]
*  lengthy two hour interview. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=3.18s)]
*  They touched on so [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=4.46s)]
*  many different topics. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=5.32s)]
*  But then, obviously, because of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=6.34s)]
*  what's happening geopolitically [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=8.0s)]
*  right now, the issue of a potential [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=9.8s)]
*  regime change war with Iran came [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=11.76s)]
*  up. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=13.56s)]
*  So at that point, Tucker Carlson [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=14.06s)]
*  just wanted some information from [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=16.68s)]
*  Ted Cruz about, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=19.48s)]
*  there's this narrative that Iran [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=21.06s)]
*  has tried to assassinate [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=23.7s)]
*  the President. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=25.66s)]
*  And I just want to know more about [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=27.76s)]
*  what's the evidence? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=29.5s)]
*  Has anyone been arrested? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=30.860000000000003s)]
*  And honestly, my favorite part [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=33.14s)]
*  about all of this is just watching [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=34.86s)]
*  Senator Cruz go from being so [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=36.82s)]
*  confident, unearned confidence to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=38.660000000000004s)]
*  just squirming, squirming like [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=41.14s)]
*  crazy, so let's watch. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=43.300000000000004s)]
*  What is true is Iran is trying to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=44.78s)]
*  assassinate Donald J Trump and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  they have hired hitmen. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=49.42s)]
*  Now you pointed out, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  he said that they had tried twice [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=52.94s)]
*  to kill him and I don't know that, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  I don't have any evidence that's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=57.06s)]
*  true. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=59.059999999999995s)]
*  I sort of wonder if that is true, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  why aren't we aware of them [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=60.94s)]
*  already? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  You rightly pointed out there's no [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  evidence that this clown in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=64.2s)]
*  Butler, Pennsylvania who shot [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=65.5s)]
*  the President was working for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  the Iranians. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=68.44s)]
*  I don't think he was, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=69.14s)]
*  there's no evidence of that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=69.86s)]
*  But what is true and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=71.06s)]
*  what your newsletter didn't [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=71.82s)]
*  acknowledge, is it true or [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=73.02s)]
*  false that Iran is currently trying [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=74.14s)]
*  to murder Donald J Trump and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=75.66s)]
*  has paid hitmen to do so? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=76.94s)]
*  Well, that's the question and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=79.34s)]
*  I don't know the Butler, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=80.88s)]
*  Pennsylvania thing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=82.02s)]
*  Butler, Pennsylvania wasn't- [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=83.22s)]
*  Let's just put that aside, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=84.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=85.14s)]
*  So Netanyahu- [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=85.86s)]
*  But to misspoke when he said those [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=86.46s)]
*  two assassinations were because of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=88.10000000000001s)]
*  Iran, but what he was saying that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=89.66s)]
*  is right is they're actively trying [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=91.26s)]
*  to murder Donald J Trump. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=92.98s)]
*  Is there, okay, so [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=94.26s)]
*  you're aware of a plot to kill [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=95.54s)]
*  Trump? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=97.5s)]
*  Yes, that Iran is paying for and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=98.3s)]
*  by the way- [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=99.98s)]
*  When? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=100.7s)]
*  It has been over the last, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=101.86s)]
*  I'd say 18 months to two years. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=103.26s)]
*  In the United States? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=105.5s)]
*  In the United States, yes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=106.26s)]
*  And let me put out- [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=107.54s)]
*  Has anyone been arrested? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=109.18s)]
*  For the Trump attempted [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=111.66s)]
*  assassination, no. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=113.14s)]
*  If there's a plot to kill Trump by [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=114.66s)]
*  the Iranians- [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=116.30000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so you dispute that the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=117.54s)]
*  Iranians are trying to kill Trump? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=119.02s)]
*  Of course, I mean, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=121.5s)]
*  that's the most important question. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=122.46s)]
*  The Prime Minister of Israel just [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=124.14s)]
*  said there have been two [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=125.86s)]
*  assassination attempts against [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=127.3s)]
*  Donald Trump by the Iranians. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=129.1s)]
*  And I think it's a very fair [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=130.66s)]
*  question, maybe you disagree, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=132.14s)]
*  to ask what are you talking about? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=133.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=135.54s)]
*  And I agree with you that he [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=136.06s)]
*  misspoke. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=137.9s)]
*  Okay, genuinely, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=141.26s)]
*  because I might be missing it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=142.26s)]
*  And if I'm missing it, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=143.86s)]
*  I want to make sure I give [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=144.78s)]
*  the appropriate people credit. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=145.98s)]
*  Has anyone else other than people [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=148.14s)]
*  like us at TYT and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=150.5s)]
*  maybe a few other independent [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=151.74s)]
*  people in independent media, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=153.7s)]
*  has anyone else asked for [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=155.98s)]
*  evidence of these claims that Iran [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=157.98s)]
*  is plotting to assassinate [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=160.46s)]
*  President Donald Trump? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=162.34s)]
*  Whether they're on the left or [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=164.26s)]
*  the right in media, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=166.3s)]
*  whether we're talking about [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=167.46s)]
*  politicians, by the way, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=169.26s)]
*  because I remember the first [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=171.06s)]
*  allegation that Iran was plotting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=172.82s)]
*  to assassinate Trump came in [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=174.9s)]
*  the context of the Biden [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  And then just recently you have [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=179.54000000000002s)]
*  the most dishonest person [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=181.9s)]
*  imaginable in terms of being [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=183.78s)]
*  a leader of a country, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=185.78s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=187.34s)]
*  The guy's been lying to us for [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  literally decades. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=190.78s)]
*  He's been telling us that Iran is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=191.94000000000003s)]
*  about to have nuclear weapons for [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  33 years, that guy lies. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=197.62s)]
*  So right now he wants the United [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=201.78000000000003s)]
*  States to carry out offensive [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=203.7s)]
*  strikes against Iran. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=205.5s)]
*  Not only do they want us to give [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=208.06s)]
*  them these insane Bunker Buster [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=210.1s)]
*  bombs that cost $3.5 million each [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=212.34s)]
*  that are like 30,000 pounds, okay? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=215.06s)]
*  Homeboy wants us to actually engage [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=219.26s)]
*  in a regime change war. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=221.78s)]

*  If you listen to the entirety of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=304.74s)]

*  he was basically trying to make [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=309.26s)]
*  a point about how, okay, so [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=311.17999999999995s)]
*  let me get this straight. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=312.82s)]
*  There have been assassination plots [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=314.17999999999995s)]
*  against the United States [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=316.97999999999996s)]

*  a foreign government. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  And we're not at all interested in [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=324.46s)]
*  going to war with them over that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=326.34s)]
*  But we want to do a regime change [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=330.5s)]
*  war in Iran over nuclear weapons [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=332.38s)]
*  that don't exist. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=334.46s)]
*  That was the bottom line, and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=337.74s)]
*  Ted Cruz realized it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=340.18s)]
*  And I think he realized how [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=342.94s)]
*  laughable that idea is, that we [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=344.85999999999996s)]

*  having nuclear weapons. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=356.61999999999995s)]
*  We'd be more concerned about that, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=358.21999999999997s)]
*  carrying out a potential [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  regime change war on, by the way, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=361.38s)]
*  Ted Cruz wants that regime change [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=363.26s)]
*  war in Iran, he does. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=365.14s)]
*  So he is in favor of military [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=366.5s)]

*  in Iran to appease Israel. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=371.14s)]
*  But if he genuinely thought, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=373.17999999999995s)]
*  if he really believed that Iran was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=375.5s)]

*  war with Iran over that? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=382.58s)]

*  Tucker Carlson. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykBBJqmYiOc&t=390.78s)]
