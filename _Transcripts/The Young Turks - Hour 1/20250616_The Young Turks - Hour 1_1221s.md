"The ‚ÄúNo Kings‚Äù protests in every state may have been the biggest day of demonstrations in American history, a data analyst has suggested.
‚ÄúBased on hundreds of crowd-sourced records of No Kings Day event turnout, and extrapolating for the cities where we don‚Äôt have data yet, it looks like roughly 4-6m people protested Trump across the U.S."

# 'No Kings' Protests Were A SMASHING SUCCESS
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI)
*  We're here live at the No Kings protest in Los Angeles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's loud, they've got a lot of cowbell. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=4.44s)]
*  And I saw that you have maybe my favorite sign today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=6.58s)]
*  I love that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=10.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good reminder. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=11.24s)]
*  I smell it's under pressure under the heat of the revolution and my butt crack. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=12.24s)]
*  Tell us what brings you out today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=17.04s)]
*  I'm just reminded that these are the same types of insecure little boys that called [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=19.84s)]
*  me names in elementary school and now they've just put on suits and call themselves officials. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=23.88s)]
*  So I'm out here to we're not gonna be shrunken, we're not gonna be silenced and nice. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=29.48s)]
*  On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people across the US took to the streets to protest [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=37.8s)]
*  Trump's power grabs and take the attention away from Trump's big beautiful birthday parade. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=43.56s)]
*  Before we get into the details about the nationwide protest, Cenk, what are your initial thoughts [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=50.92s)]
*  on the No Kings Day of Action? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=55.88s)]
*  I kind of love it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  I think that it's a good way to fight back. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=61.24s)]
*  And as far as I could tell, it was all peaceful, beautiful protests, most American thing that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=65.2s)]
*  you could do. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=71.48s)]
*  We're asking you guys in a live chat poll, do you think that No Kings protest had an [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=73.64s)]
*  impact, right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=77.76s)]
*  And I think that the impact is a good question. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=80.0s)]
*  And I think that that's what we should discuss. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=82.9s)]
*  But let's figure out what happened first, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=85.2s)]
*  And then I'll tell you why I think that it was so positive. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=88.1s)]
*  Okay, well, let's give you some context on this protest. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=93.38s)]
*  The No Kings theme was orchestrated by the 5051 movement, a national movement made up [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=98.5s)]
*  of everyday Americans who stand for democracy and against what they call the authoritarian [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=105.6s)]
*  actions of the Trump administration. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=111.8s)]
*  The name 5051 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=113.82s)]
*  And according to their website, the Trump administration defied our courts, deported [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  Americans disappeared, people off the streets attacked our civil rights and slashed our [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=126.5s)]
*  services. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=131.94s)]
*  They've done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=133.14s)]
*  They described the protests as a nationwide day of defiance. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=139.26s)]
*  While the No Kings protest follows days of civil unrest in Los Angeles due to federal [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  immigration raids, and especially Trump's deployment of the National Guard, that was [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  not the sole focus. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=155.22s)]
*  TYT spoke to Karen Rasmussen at the protest in downtown LA, who was protesting over a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=157.06s)]
*  multitude of things. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=163.98s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=165.73999999999998s)]
*  Thousands of people are going to die. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=167.34s)]
*  When Rubio says that no children are dying on his watch, he is a liar. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=169.38s)]
*  Children will die, women will die, refugees will die, people all over the world who depended [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=175.22s)]
*  on our aid are going to die. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=181.3s)]
*  My name's Karen and I'm here because I lost my job. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=183.66s)]
*  I was working with the UN Migration Agency, IOM, and one of the first executive orders [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=187.46s)]
*  of Trump closed the US Refugee Admissions Program after two decades of safely bringing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=193.5s)]
*  refugees to the United States. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=200.1s)]
*  It is just heartbreaking to think about how many people will suffer. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  People who had nothing to do with our government, nothing to do with our country, are going [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  to suffer and die as a result of the decisions of not only Trump, but Musk and his so-called [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=212.42s)]
*  Department of Government efficiency. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  Where's the waste? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  Where's the fraud? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=225.74s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=226.74s)]
*  So was the protest successful? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=230.54s)]
*  If anything, it definitely made a statement. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=233.38s)]
*  Over 2000 protests, which were largely peaceful, were scheduled across all 50 states. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=236.14000000000001s)]
*  And according to data analysts, it may have been the biggest day of demonstrations in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  US history. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=247.62s)]
*  According to data analyst G. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  Elliott Morris, as of midnight on Sunday, June 15th, we have data from about 40% of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=250.94s)]
*  no Kings Day events held yesterday, accounting for over 2.6 million attendees. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=257.74s)]
*  According to our back of the envelope math, that puts total attendance somewhere in the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=264.74s)]
*  4 to 6 million people range. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=269.18s)]
*  That means roughly 1.2 to 1.8% of the US population attended a no Kings Day event somewhere in [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=271.58s)]
*  the country yesterday. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=279.38s)]
*  Now Trump tried to play it cool last week. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=280.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=284.14s)]
*  But it's safe to say this was a massive hit to Trump's ego, especially when you look at [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=309.38s)]
*  his parades attendance. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=316.38s)]
*  You can see the comparison here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=318.1s)]
*  All the way down, I don't know if you could see it, it's so small, 250,000, maybe at best. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=321.06s)]
*  We'll get into that in the next block. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=326.86s)]
*  But 4 to 6 million and likely much more for the no Kings Day parade. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=328.98s)]
*  Now Trump's communications director, Steven Chung, made the claim that 250,000 people [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=336.26s)]
*  were present. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  But MSNBC's Vaughn Hilliard, who was present, claims there were far fewer people there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=344.42s)]
*  Hours after the protests took place, however, Trump took to Truth Social and ordered ICE [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=350.86s)]
*  to hit harder in Democratic run cities. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=356.2s)]
*  Posting every day, the brave men and women of ICE are subjected to violence, harassment [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=361.09999999999997s)]
*  and even threats from radical Democrat politicians. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=366.02s)]
*  But nothing will stop us from executing our mission and fulfilling our mandate to the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=370.7s)]
*  American people. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=375.46s)]
*  ICE officers are herewith ordered by notice of this truth to do all in their power to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=376.98s)]
*  achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest mass deportation program [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=383.58s)]
*  in history. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=389.94s)]
*  We must expand efforts to detain and deport illegal aliens in America's largest cities [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=391.5s)]
*  such as Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, where millions upon millions of illegal aliens [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=397.96s)]
*  reside. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=403.68s)]
*  There and other such cities are the core of the Democrat power center, where they use [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=405.3s)]
*  illegal aliens to expand their voter base, cheat in elections and grow the welfare state. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=409.7s)]
*  These radical left Democrats are sick of mind, hate our country and actually want to destroy [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=416.1s)]
*  our inner cities. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=422.94s)]
*  And they are doing a good job of it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  There is something wrong with them. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=426.8s)]
*  Now, Cenk, there's a lot here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=429.14000000000004s)]
*  I'd love to hear your thoughts, but maybe my first question is, do you think Trump wrote [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=430.90000000000003s)]
*  the word herewith? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=436.12s)]
*  That's less likely. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=439.70000000000005s)]
*  Okay, I like that bit of investigative reporting you did there to figure out that maybe Trump [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=440.70000000000005s)]
*  didn't write that exactly. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=446.22s)]
*  So all right, first of all, overall, I love protests. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=449.06s)]
*  I've organized, I don't know, a dozen protests. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=452.86s)]
*  I think what the civil rights movement did was perfect and beautiful. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=455.38s)]
*  I believe in civil disobedience. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=460.3s)]
*  So I do get frustrated with two things that sometimes happen at protests that, thank God, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=463.14s)]
*  didn't happen here at all. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=467.02s)]
*  Okay, so number one is sometimes when people that are not being productive go and burn [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=468.42s)]
*  Waymo's or American flags or something, don't, don't, don't, don't. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=473.66s)]
*  We want America to be on our side. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=478.02s)]
*  We don't want America to be against us. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=480.3s)]
*  Don't help Trump by putting out a bad image of all the protesters with bad actions from [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=482.9s)]
*  just a couple of people. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=489.28s)]
*  So in this case, they didn't. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=490.64s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=491.94s)]
*  It was peaceful. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=492.94s)]
*  It was America showing up and going, we don't want this. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=493.94s)]
*  We don't want Marines in the streets of our American cities. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=497.46s)]
*  We don't want Donald Trump trying to violate the Constitution at every turn, etc. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=501.0s)]
*  So amazing. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  Number two is I get a little frustrated these days that people don't get a step two. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=507.88s)]
*  You come to a protest, yes, but how are we actually going to get Trump out of power, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=512.16s)]
*  right? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=516.68s)]
*  But in this case, I think that there was two things that made it powerful. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=517.68s)]
*  One is, look, just as always, the reason why I like protests is it shows camaraderie. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=521.22s)]
*  All these Americans, 4 to 6 million Americans showing up in big cities, small towns, and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=526.34s)]
*  that's powerful. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=531.58s)]
*  We covered the military parade and the No Kings protests on the Young Turks live on [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=533.14s)]
*  Saturday. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=537.5s)]
*  I co-hosted with Ben Cohen from Ben and Jerry's, and then we had a bunch of experts on, by [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=538.5s)]
*  the way, you should check out Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson's interview in the middle of that [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=542.62s)]
*  coverage. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=547.3000000000001s)]
*  It was haunting about his time as Chief of Staff to Colin Powell and how there's a small [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=548.3000000000001s)]
*  group of people in this country who are always pushing for war. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=553.06s)]
*  And so if you're a member, you can check it out anytime. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=558.54s)]
*  And I think we've got those interviews up on The Conversation, which is another channel [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=561.9799999999999s)]
*  that the Young Turks have. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=566.18s)]
*  But as we were doing that, the camaraderie is always great in here. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=568.4599999999999s)]
*  I'll read one comment from one of our members that I think summarizes it well. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=572.3s)]
*  Casey Progressive wrote in, yes, it had an impact. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  If nothing else, it was a morale boost of our community. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=579.46s)]
*  I know personally it was powerful to see how many of us are in my community and we are [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=582.9000000000001s)]
*  far more than they think. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=587.4200000000001s)]
*  So especially in those small towns, so that was perfect. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=589.7800000000001s)]
*  And thank you for participating and for seeing that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=592.26s)]
*  And by the way, you could become a member at tyt.com slash join. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=595.38s)]
*  The members do the shows with us or you could hit the join button below on YouTube. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=598.94s)]
*  Okay, so Ojeda also joined us. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=602.3000000000001s)]
*  Richard Ojeda is on Rebel headquarters, but he's also running in North Carolina 9. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=604.34s)]
*  He's part of the rebellion pack. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=609.38s)]
*  He's joined the rebellion. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=610.74s)]
*  And he talked about how in Fayetteville, North Carolina, there was 500 people that showed [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=612.26s)]
*  up in this tiny little town. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=616.7800000000001s)]
*  So that kind of camaraderie is great. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=618.7800000000001s)]
*  Number two is, in this case, it was on the same day as the military parade. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=620.0600000000001s)]
*  So as goofball Trump is playing with his toy soldiers and tanks and trying to show him [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=625.1s)]
*  so I'm the big guy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=632.34s)]
*  And by the way, Washington looked like it was occupied. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=634.14s)]
*  And especially as a war was starting in the Middle East again, it looked terrible. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=637.7s)]
*  We'll talk more about that later in the show. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=641.4200000000001s)]
*  And then meanwhile, you had all these millions of Americans showing up saying we don't want [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=643.62s)]
*  it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=648.26s)]
*  We don't want the militarization. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=649.26s)]
*  We don't want it inside the country. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=650.26s)]
*  We don't want the wars outside the country. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=651.7s)]
*  We don't want you to violate the Constitution. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=653.5400000000001s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=655.86s)]
*  So I'm curious what the audience that's watching live. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=657.3000000000001s)]
*  We do this show live 6 to 8 PM Eastern every day. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=661.38s)]
*  The poll was, do you think the No Kings protest had an impact? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=664.02s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=667.9s)]
*  75% yes, 25% no. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=668.9s)]
*  I get the 25%. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=671.22s)]
*  I get people get frustrated. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=672.22s)]
*  Protest them, what do we do, right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=674.14s)]
*  But the protest itself today was part of the action of showing the juxtaposition between [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=675.46s)]
*  Trump's militarism and actual Americans saying we don't want that kind of militarism. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=680.5s)]
*  That's not America, right? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=685.22s)]
*  And to me, when you get to the substance of it, look, we covered Tim Dillon earlier today, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=687.78s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=696.14s)]
*  And he's totally against the Iran war. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=697.14s)]
*  He voted for Trump, but he's against the Iran war. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=700.54s)]
*  And he's like, this is not an American priority at all. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=703.18s)]
*  But before that, he was talking about immigration. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=706.3s)]
*  And in immigration, he was like, look, if all they did was arrest criminals that were [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=708.3399999999999s)]
*  undocumented immigrants, MS-13, human smugglers, etc., or people that had just come across [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=713.62s)]
*  the border, that would be super popular. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=719.42s)]
*  But once you start going in the middle of the country and taking people out of their [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=722.0600000000001s)]
*  high school graduations and restaurants, and then you bring in the military to do it, American [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=726.18s)]
*  people aren't going to like that. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=732.46s)]
*  And he's 100% right. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=733.86s)]
*  I think that he's right on both of those counts. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=735.14s)]
*  And so I know not only will the American people not like it, so if you ask me my opinion, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=737.66s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=742.58s)]
*  The Marines do not belong in American cities. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=743.58s)]
*  They are for fighting foreign enemies. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=746.0600000000001s)]
*  They are trained to kill foreign enemies. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=748.22s)]
*  Having them arrest people as they did in LA and be involved in the streets here, we're [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=751.4200000000001s)]
*  going to have Marines in the streets everywhere? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=754.86s)]
*  I mean, especially as Israel wants to drag us into another war. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=756.34s)]
*  Hey, conveniently, we now have military in the streets of the major cities. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=760.26s)]
*  So if anyone objects to Trump or to Israel, easier to round them up. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=764.72s)]
*  No, no, I hate all of it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=769.46s)]
*  I don't want it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=771.38s)]
*  We don't need it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=772.38s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=773.38s)]
*  So I love that they did this protest. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=774.5799999999999s)]
*  So I'm so glad you mentioned about the step two. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=777.02s)]
*  That's immediately where my mind went that day and through the rest of the weekend. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=781.74s)]
*  So I'll give you kind of what I saw. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=786.26s)]
*  So in LA, of course, we had this massive protest downtown. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=789.54s)]
*  And like you're saying, it was peaceful. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=793.14s)]
*  After the fact, there are people still hanging around. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=795.54s)]
*  And there was this incredible moment on MSNBC where Jacob Sobroff is saying, yes, it has [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=797.78s)]
*  been 100% peaceful. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=803.66s)]
*  Within 30 seconds, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department started firing less lethals, a [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=805.82s)]
*  whole conversation around that for another day, into the crowd. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=811.86s)]
*  And you saw from there, things were escalated. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=815.98s)]
*  It was almost like perfect timing. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=818.66s)]
*  And him reminding the viewers everything was peaceful to law enforcement escalating. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=821.7s)]
*  And I really want to stress this happens all the time. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=827.7s)]
*  So when you see people reacting or throwing things, it's important to understand where [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=830.46s)]
*  so many of the times that's how things originate, especially here. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=834.34s)]
*  On step two, it's yes, what does it look like from there? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=838.9000000000001s)]
*  I would hope that new connections were formed. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=841.6600000000001s)]
*  I would hope that this empowers people and inspires people to participate, to get involved [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=845.02s)]
*  and to remain involved going forward. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=850.58s)]
*  And what does that look like? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=853.26s)]
*  So I tell you, I was thinking about this all weekend. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=854.7800000000001s)]
*  I have a video over on the Insurgence YouTube channel for my podcast where I laid out what [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=857.1800000000001s)]
*  I've seen in my own community, in my own neighborhood. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=862.22s)]
*  People have established a rapid response network. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=865.14s)]
*  So if ICE comes to our neighborhood, which seems inevitable at this point, there are [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=867.82s)]
*  people who are volunteering to show up. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=871.7s)]
*  There are community events that happen weekly that they're volunteering to stay on guard [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=874.1s)]
*  and protect the street vendors. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=877.9399999999999s)]
*  And even on Sunday night, I'd say over a thousand people gathered in Highland Park, waving their [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=880.54s)]
*  signs, beeping their horns as traffic went by to remind people, hey, we're all in this [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=886.5799999999999s)]
*  together and if you are undocumented and if you are in peril, you could be next. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=892.18s)]
*  We've got your back. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=898.1s)]
*  We're going to look out for you. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=899.1s)]
*  It's going to take more than that. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=900.4599999999999s)]
*  And I would encourage everyone to, if you're not here and if you're not even in one of [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=901.9399999999999s)]
*  those democratic cities that they're going after, start to build that infrastructure [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=906.8199999999999s)]
*  proactively before ICE and DHS comes to your town. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=910.9s)]
*  So when they single out these towns, New York, Chicago, LA, they're doing it to drive a political [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=915.42s)]
*  narrative. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=920.38s)]
*  But if you look at the data, Pew Research did a study and they published it in 2024 [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=921.38s)]
*  relying on data from 2022 that showed where undocumented people live in the United States. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=925.54s)]
*  The top two and three after California in terms of states with the most undocumented [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=931.74s)]
*  people are Florida and Texas. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=937.1s)]
*  You don't see Trump talking about those two states because it doesn't fit their narrative. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=939.48s)]
*  They want to go after sanctuary city laws, which just precludes local law enforcement [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=943.38s)]
*  from participating in DHS and ICE raids. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=948.82s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=953.26s)]
*  And they use that as pretext to demonize an entire city, cities of millions of people [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=954.26s)]
*  and convey a false pretense and mislead viewers, especially in right-wing media about the realities [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=960.26s)]
*  on the ground here. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=965.2199999999999s)]
*  What you're seeing here is inspiring. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=966.54s)]
*  And what you're going to see in Chicago when things get amped up there and in New York [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=968.54s)]
*  are going to be similar. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=972.7399999999999s)]
*  People don't want federal agents and Marines and the National Guard coming in and ripping [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=974.66s)]
*  people off the streets and sending them to God knows where. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=979.62s)]
*  They don't have due process in these situations. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=982.9399999999999s)]
*  It is invasive. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=986.54s)]
*  It is scary. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=987.5799999999999s)]
*  It can be dangerous at times. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=988.58s)]
*  So I would encourage all of you to proactively start to organize in your community for when [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=990.6600000000001s)]
*  ICE eventually comes to your town. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=996.1s)]
*  Yeah, so I want to build on that a little bit. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=998.1s)]
*  First on the protestor, somebody had a parody of the don't tread on me flag. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1000.46s)]
*  I love that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1005.7s)]
*  Yeah, what happened to don't tread on me? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1006.7s)]
*  The Marines in streets of American cities is definitely treading on us. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1009.1800000000001s)]
*  Okay, so a way to point that out. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1015.1800000000001s)]
*  Look, I would say to you, if you're going to go to a protest against Trump, bring as [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1017.7s)]
*  many American flags as you can. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1021.7s)]
*  We represent Americans. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1023.8s)]
*  We are America. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1025.6s)]
*  This is America saying you're violating our constitution, our laws, our traditions, our [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1026.98s)]
*  customs, okay? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1032.22s)]
*  So and I want to back up what Jordan said. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1034.38s)]
*  Over and over again, it's either the local police or when this first started in LA ICE [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1037.42s)]
*  that starts the hostilities. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1042.06s)]
*  ICE started all of this on day one by throwing tear gas canisters, flashbang grenades into [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1044.2199999999998s)]
*  the crowd, hitting people, etc. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1049.78s)]
*  And then people had a natural reaction to throw things back, right? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1052.26s)]
*  So they're being purposely provocative to try to find an excuse to basically attack [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1056.08s)]
*  these cities. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1061.86s)]
*  Even though as Jordan pointed out, a lot of undocumented immigrants are actually in red [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1062.9399999999998s)]
*  states. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1066.54s)]
*  So when you do that, that means you're not trying to solve that problem. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1067.54s)]
*  You're trying to create a new political problem that you solve by bringing in troops to these [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1070.74s)]
*  cities and trying to occupy American cities. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1076.14s)]
*  And then finally, I heard from a friend of mine lives in a community that ICE raided. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1080.22s)]
*  And everybody gets word of it, they start panicking and they start hiding nannies, cleaning [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1089.28s)]
*  nannies, etc. in their basements. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1097.66s)]
*  Here's what Americans don't want to do, hide people in their basements as the federal authority [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1101.22s)]
*  Gestapo looks for them in the middle of the country. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1107.22s)]
*  They don't want that. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1111.06s)]
*  Here's another thing Americans don't want, Marines and US military in the streets of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1112.38s)]
*  America. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1117.7s)]
*  Here's a third thing Americans don't want, this war in Iran, okay? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1118.7s)]
*  So here's my prediction. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1122.28s)]
*  Trump's poll numbers are going to drop and they're going to drop precipitously. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1124.46s)]
*  Not a little bit, but a lot. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1130.3000000000002s)]
*  Because as you see all these things happening over the course of about a week, I think Americans [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1133.22s)]
*  are beginning to get a very unsettled feeling in the pit of their stomach. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1139.7s)]
*  There's something wrong here. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1145.6200000000001s)]
*  Way too much military, military parade, military attacking their own citizens in the streets. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1147.48s)]
*  And now war in the Middle East. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1154.24s)]
*  No, this was exactly what we didn't vote for. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1156.44s)]
*  The left didn't want it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1161.32s)]
*  By the way, the right didn't want a lot of this originally. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1162.48s)]
*  I mean, I know they love attacking immigrants. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1165.0s)]
*  No question that a big portion of the right loves that, right? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1167.94s)]
*  But they didn't vote for the war, that's clear. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1171.0800000000002s)]
*  And hey, Maggie, if you voted for Marines in the streets, don't ever warn us about tyrannical [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1173.92s)]
*  government again. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1181.8s)]
*  Because what would tyrannical government do first to control the population? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1184.04s)]
*  They would put the military in the streets. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1188.4199999999998s)]
*  Literally every banana republic that has a dictator, that's step one. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1190.9199999999998s)]
*  So here we are right in the beginning of the Trump administration and he immediately goes [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1196.58s)]
*  to step one. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1200.48s)]
*  No, no, this is unsettling and he will pay a heavy political price for this. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1201.8799999999999s)]
*  And then they make us strong and they make us honest. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ZEl6bKNNI&t=1211.8s)]
