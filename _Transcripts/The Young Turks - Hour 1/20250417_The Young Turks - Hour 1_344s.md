The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Poll: Americans Are ON BOARD With Trump On This ONE Issue
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80)
*  Even though the Trump administration is facing more and more heat over this mistaken deportation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=0.0s)]
*  and the refusal to honor due process, the reality is that most Americans are on board with Trump's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=6.16s)]
*  broader immigration agenda. And that is why he's doing everything he can to steer the conversation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=11.84s)]
*  in that direction. Here are the numbers from CNN's Harry Enton. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=17.76s)]
*  This is a big reason why. So take a look here. This is on immigration. What track are we on? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=21.6s)]
*  The right track or the wrong track? Look in December. Look at the percentage who said we [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=27.6s)]
*  were on the wrong track. 62% of Americans when Joe Biden was in office compared to just 14% who [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=31.92s)]
*  said that we were on the right track. Flash forward to April. Well, hello, 45% say we're [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=39.28s)]
*  on the right track compared to 42% who say we're on the wrong track. So in a big switcheroo from [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=44.8s)]
*  where we were back in January, the plurality of Americans say that the country is on the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=50.16s)]
*  right track when it comes to immigration policy. Deport all undocumented immigrants, voters favoring [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=54.48s)]
*  the government trying to deport all 11 million of them. Back in 2016, just 38% of voters wanted the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  government to try to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants. Compared to where we [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=67.52s)]
*  are in 2025, 56% the majority. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=72.64s)]
*  So Enton also calculates that Trump's approval rating on immigration is plus one, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=76.48s)]
*  but some other polls don't look quite as good for the president. In a new Quinnipiac poll, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=84.88s)]
*  for instance, Trump's net approval on immigration issues is minus 5% on deportation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=90.16s)]
*  Specifically, it's minus 10%. Cenk, we've all been hearing from Republicans for the last several [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=95.36s)]
*  years that they're not anti-immigration, they're anti-illegal immigration. That's a very important [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=101.36s)]
*  caveat for them. But we know that that's really not true. If they were anti-illegal immigration, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=106.88s)]
*  I feel like they would approach the issue differently. They might actually look into [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=112.8s)]
*  the process of getting into this country legally and try to understand what it actually takes, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=117.2s)]
*  how difficult it is, how long it can take. They might actually talk about reforming the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  immigration process because it is incredibly convoluted and risky and time consuming. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=127.2s)]
*  But they're not having any of those conversations. So they just hide behind this facade of legal [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  versus illegal immigration because at least in my opinion, they are actually xenophobic. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=138.4s)]
*  They probably themselves wouldn't identify as being xenophobic. They probably don't think of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=143.84s)]
*  themselves that way, but I feel like they are and I feel like that's what this all comes down to. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  Immigrants do not have a place in the white picketed fenced Pleasantville fever dream [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=152.64s)]
*  that these people actually wanna live in. Yeah, so look, I think that there is two different [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=158.72s)]
*  things going on in the immigration issue. And that's why these polls seem confusing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=165.92s)]
*  Some have it as hey, majority of Americans saying deport everybody who's undocumented. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=171.27999999999997s)]
*  The other saying that Trump's popularity on this is actually waning and going down significantly. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=176.72s)]
*  And I think there's a good explanation for both. It's because when he came in, he did shut down [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=182.32s)]
*  the border and the border crossings really got massively reduced. And that greatly frustrates [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=188.0s)]
*  me because apparently it could have been done, but Biden chose not to do it. But then that puts us in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=194.88s)]
*  an unpopular position and at least abuses like Trump is doing right now, right? On the other hand, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=200.88s)]
*  again, if you're on the right wing, you should be more frustrated at Trump than we are. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=208.48s)]
*  Number one, you claim to love the Constitution all these years, I hope you meant it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=213.52s)]
*  Number two is that his policies on shutting down the border are very, very popular. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=218.0s)]
*  But now his overall immigration policies, as you see in the Quinnipiac poll, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=223.68s)]
*  are beginning to be unpopular. Why? Because he's abusing the Constitution. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=227.76s)]
*  So how does that help? That doesn't help your cause. Trump could have been super popular on [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=232.56s)]
*  immigration and he could have, look, I don't believe in the mass deportations at all. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=236.72s)]
*  But if you're on the right or apparently in the middle and you now believe in mass deportations, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=241.6s)]
*  well, Trump is doing a lot of harm to that cause. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=246.32s)]
*  Because he's doing it in such a wild, irresponsible, unconstitutional, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=249.36s)]
*  authoritarian way where he's rounding up people that were ordered to stay in the country that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=253.68s)]
*  shouldn't be sent back, that aren't criminals. So he's making that position unpopular. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=259.6s)]
*  So that's why you're seeing that diversity in those polls and them going in separate directions. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=266.0s)]
*  So as usual, if Trump just could keep his worst authoritarian impulses under control, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=273.84s)]
*  he actually could have had a win here, but he's turning that win into a loss. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=280.16s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like just the wildness of this administration, generally speaking, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=284.96s)]
*  is very scary to so many Americans. And we're hearing it come up in all these Republican [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  town halls across the country in very red districts. They are bringing up the fact [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=295.2s)]
*  that Trump is denying these orders from the Supreme Court. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=299.92s)]
*  And again, just to remind everyone, that was a unanimous ruling from the Supreme Court. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=303.84s)]
*  I can't even remember the last time we saw something like that, especially not with this [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=308.4s)]
*  particular court. I don't think it ever has happened. But people are worried. And on top of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  everything, we also have the tariffs. Things just feel wildly unstable right now. People don't know [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=318.4s)]
*  what to expect. People don't know what's happening. And the rules that we have all grown up with, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=324.32s)]
*  the rules that we have known in this country for centuries, those don't seem to matter anymore. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=329.68s)]
*  And it's making people very uncomfortable. That's what I think is happening. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Duwk_G7mb80&t=334.08s)]
