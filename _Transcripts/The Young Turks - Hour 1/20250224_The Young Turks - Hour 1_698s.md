The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# TYT REACTS To Dan Bongino's New Job in The Trump Admin
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o)
*  because this may be a little bit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=0.0s)]
*  emotional and let me apologize in [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=1.8s)]
*  advance. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to accept the role [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=4.92s)]
*  proudly as a deputy director, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=7.88s)]
*  the number two spot at the Federal [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=10.72s)]
*  Bureau of Investigation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=13.52s)]
*  Conservative media star and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=15.64s)]
*  podcaster Dan Bongino has been [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=17.64s)]
*  appointed by Donald Trump to serve [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=19.84s)]
*  as deputy director of the FBI. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Now, normally a veteran agent of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=24.92s)]
*  the bureau is chosen to serve [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  in this role. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=29.639999999999997s)]
*  However, that is not the case with [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=31.16s)]
*  this administration, which of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  course is approaching appointments [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=35.199999999999996s)]
*  and nominations in unconventional [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=37.32s)]
*  ways, right Cenk? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=39.44s)]
*  Definitely, I think that there's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  a reason why he picked Bongino. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=43.8s)]
*  Well, there's actually two reasons. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=45.76s)]
*  And the real question is which one [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=47.959999999999994s)]
*  of those two reasons because one of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=49.44s)]
*  them is disastrous and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=50.92s)]
*  the other one is actually [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=51.959999999999994s)]
*  defensible. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=53.16s)]
*  So we'll get to it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=54.36s)]
*  Okay, so Donald Trump announced [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=55.28s)]
*  this on social media. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=57.0s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=58.48s)]
*  He basically wrote that Dan [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=59.8s)]
*  Bongino is a man of incredible love [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=61.72s)]
*  and passion for our country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=64.11999999999999s)]
*  And he has just been named the next [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  deputy director of the FBI. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=67.92s)]
*  Trump then notes that Bongino [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  previously worked for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=71.32s)]
*  the New York Police Department and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  was a special agent with the US [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=75.08s)]
*  Secret Service. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=77.0s)]
*  He also wrote this, another aspect [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  of the life of Dan Bongino that I [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=81.16s)]
*  think is very important. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=83.6s)]
*  He has a great wife, Paula. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=86.08s)]
*  And two wonderful daughters who [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=88.56s)]
*  truly love their dad, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=90.08s)]
*  what an incredible job Dan will do. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=91.16000000000001s)]
*  Now in the past, FBI directors, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=93.44s)]
*  again, have been selected senior [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  agents with extensive experience. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Bongino has not served any role in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=101.12s)]
*  the FBI, does not have any FBI [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=103.2s)]
*  training or experience. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  But if you're wondering what his [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=107.12s)]
*  job entails, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=109.2s)]
*  what his responsibilities would be, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=110.16s)]
*  he would essentially serve as [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=112.56s)]
*  the FBI's second in command, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=114.44s)]
*  obviously. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=116.28s)]
*  They are responsible for all FBI [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  domestic and international [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=119.12s)]
*  investigations and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=120.76s)]
*  intelligence activities. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=122.0s)]
*  He would develop and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=123.76s)]
*  implement the FBI strategic [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=125.16s)]
*  priorities and policies and oversee [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=127.16s)]
*  the work of FBI executives, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=129.6s)]
*  including assistant directors and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  special agents in charge. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=133.8s)]
*  Lastly, they provide counsel, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=135.68s)]
*  he would provide counsel and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=137.8s)]
*  advice to the FBI director. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=139.56s)]
*  In this case, of course, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=141.4s)]
*  that would be Cash Patel who was [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=142.76s)]
*  confirmed to serve in his role [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=144.4s)]
*  last week. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=146.0s)]
*  Yeah, so Dan Bongino's fiery guy [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=147.32s)]
*  and he's gotten into some big [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=150.56s)]
*  fights with Geraldo Rivera, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  Politico Media, you name it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=156.5s)]
*  Us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Us, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=160.04s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=160.56s)]
*  And I had a big debate with him [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=161.06s)]
*  before the election about Trump. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  And that's not the issue that I [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=166.16s)]
*  care about. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=169.0s)]
*  The issue I care about is, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=170.16s)]
*  is this brother qualified for [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=172.6s)]
*  this exact job, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=175.48s)]
*  Because this job usually goes to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=177.92s)]
*  someone with a lot of management [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=179.64s)]
*  experience and who's normally [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  an FBI agent. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=183.04s)]
*  So Cash Patel and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=184.0s)]
*  Dan Bongino have absolutely no [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=185.12s)]
*  experience with the FBI or [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=187.2s)]
*  how to manage the FBI. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=188.84s)]
*  So yeah, Bongino was a cop once and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=190.64s)]
*  he was in the Secret Service once. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=192.4s)]
*  But that doesn't mean you know how [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=194.16s)]
*  to manage 38,000 employees with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=196.04s)]
*  very specific tasks at the FBI, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=197.88s)]
*  which you have no familiarity with. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=199.68s)]
*  So my guess is, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  if you put anyone in there that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=203.68s)]
*  didn't have that experience, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=205.88s)]
*  they'd be overwhelmed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=208.28s)]
*  Okay, now you're going to take [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  a talk show host and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=212.76s)]
*  put them in there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=213.68s)]
*  And they might be extraordinary, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=215.16s)]
*  there's probably some that are [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  amazing, I hope, okay? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=218.8s)]
*  But for that job, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=220.56s)]
*  that doesn't seem right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=222.04s)]
*  So why did Trump pick him? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=224.92s)]
*  The two reasons I was alluding to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=225.92s)]
*  earlier are, one, he loves anyone [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=227.8s)]
*  who could make their case for him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=229.88s)]
*  He believes in messaging 200%, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=232.0s)]
*  right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=234.08s)]
*  So messaging over substance. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=234.76s)]
*  The Democrats apparently don't know [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=237.2s)]
*  that messaging exists, so [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=239.52s)]
*  they never do any messaging. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=241.24s)]
*  So the Democrats weigh under [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=243.16s)]
*  message, and here Trump is [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=245.04s)]
*  emphasizing message to the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=246.84s)]
*  detriment of actual competence or [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=248.72s)]
*  experience in this field. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  So I think that's a mistake, but [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=252.8s)]
*  I at least understand it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=255.28s)]
*  What I'm worried about and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=257.2s)]
*  what we should all be worried about [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=258.8s)]
*  is that that's the secondary reason [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=260.96s)]
*  that Trump picked him. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=263.32s)]
*  And the primary reason that he [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=264.84s)]
*  picked him is because he wants [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=266.56s)]
*  loyalists that are the head of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=268.28s)]
*  the FBI and the second in charge. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=270.08s)]
*  So if he gives an order that is [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  illegal or unconstitutional, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=274.08s)]
*  that they don't ask questions and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  they follow that order. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  And so have Cash Patel and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=279.64s)]
*  Dan Bongino been loyalists of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=281.08s)]
*  Trump? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=282.88s)]
*  Absolutely, 200%, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  never question him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=285.12s)]
*  I don't know, maybe Dan's disagreed [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=286.88s)]
*  with him on some things, but [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=288.24s)]
*  I've never heard it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=289.28s)]
*  It doesn't mean that it doesn't [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=290.2s)]
*  exist if I didn't hear it, but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=291.36s)]
*  it certainly hasn't been in the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=292.64s)]
*  press. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=293.96s)]
*  And so, but I don't know what's in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  his heart and his brain. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  Cash Patel has made it super [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=299.0s)]
*  clear, his only reason for [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  existence is to do whatever Trump [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=301.4s)]
*  tells him to do. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=303.08s)]
*  Although on the other hand, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=304.36s)]
*  he just defied Elon Musk. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=305.84s)]
*  So that was super surprising. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=307.28s)]
*  That was beyond surprising because [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=309.2s)]
*  it's not just that Cash Patel [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=311.2s)]
*  defied Elon Musk. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=312.84s)]
*  Donald Trump has consistently [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=314.32s)]
*  defended what Elon Musk has been up [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=316.24s)]
*  to with the Department of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=318.56s)]
*  Government Efficiency and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=320.08s)]
*  the firing of all these federal [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=321.58s)]
*  employees. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=323.08s)]
*  So in pushing back against Elon [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  Musk, Cash Patel is in a way [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=325.52s)]
*  pushing back against Donald Trump [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  who supports what Elon Musk is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=328.84s)]
*  doing, again, did not expect that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  to happen. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=332.52s)]
*  And we'll see when more contentious [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  issues come up, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  what Cash Patel is willing to do. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=336.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'll tell you, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  this is really not, I'm going to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=339.2s)]
*  tell you two things that are small. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=340.88s)]
*  One is my experience and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=342.4s)]
*  the silver lining. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=343.88s)]
*  So when I debated him for an hour, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  I was expecting someone who was far [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=347.88s)]
*  more irrational. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=349.88s)]
*  Like foaming at the mouth. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=351.24s)]
*  Yeah, and crazed and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=352.16s)]
*  conspiracy theories and he does [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=353.22s)]
*  some, no question, no question, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=355.0s)]
*  okay, from our perspective. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=357.0s)]
*  But it was a fine back and forth, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=359.72s)]
*  you go watch it on line somewhere, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=361.72s)]
*  I presume. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=364.04s)]
*  And so we totally disagreed and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=366.32000000000005s)]
*  he was totally for Trump and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  I was against him, etc. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=369.56s)]
*  But it was a more rational [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  conversation than I expected. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  It gave me like one, two, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=374.48s)]
*  couple of percent hope, right? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=376.36s)]
*  That he's not just going to be [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=378.76s)]
*  wild radical, we'll see. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  But that's tiny, because I only had [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=382.04s)]
*  one hour of interaction with him. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=384.2s)]
*  And then the tiny silver lining is, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=386.56s)]
*  if Dan Bongino, I just can't have [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=389.2s)]
*  hope in Cash Patel, but if Dan [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=391.76s)]
*  Bongino says he will not execute [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  an illegal or unconstitutional [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=396.8s)]
*  order, that would have a lot more [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=399.44s)]
*  weight with MAGA in the right wing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=402.0s)]
*  So if some other random Republican [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=404.52s)]
*  or elected politician said, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=406.24s)]
*  I'll stand up to Donald Trump, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=407.44s)]
*  they're going to get steamrolled. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  But if Bongino says, no, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=410.44s)]
*  this is wrong, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=411.56s)]
*  this is unconstitutional, I mean, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  it's very, very unlikely, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=413.56s)]
*  very unlikely. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  But if he says it, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=416.35999999999996s)]
*  that would have a lot of weight. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  Wait, hold on, I want to understand [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  why you think that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  Why do you think that would have [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=422.28s)]
*  a lot of weight and why would you [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=423.64s)]
*  think that Trump's most ardent [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=425.2s)]
*  defenders would side with Bongino [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=426.96s)]
*  and potentially agree with what [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=428.96s)]
*  Bongino is saying in pushing it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=430.88s)]
*  back against something Donald Trump [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=432.88s)]
*  might want him to do that could be [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=434.92s)]
*  unconstitutional? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=436.8s)]
*  Okay, I'm actually surprised you're [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=438.52s)]
*  saying that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=440.76s)]
*  So let's take an example here. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=441.44s)]
*  And again, remember, this is tiny, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=443.04s)]
*  tiny silver lining, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=445.08s)]
*  We have representative Joe Blow or [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=446.6s)]
*  pick a real one, Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=449.15999999999997s)]
*  And he's put in as deputy director [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=452.12s)]
*  of the FBI and he goes, I don't [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=454.08s)]
*  agree with Trump on this and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=455.84s)]
*  I'm going to resign because of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=457.32s)]
*  this, right? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=458.88s)]
*  Everybody in MAGA would be like, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=459.48s)]
*  good riddance, right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=461.32s)]
*  Okay, don't let the door hit you [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=463.24s)]
*  on the way out. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=464.72s)]
*  We don't care, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=465.48s)]
*  you hold zero weight, right? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=466.48s)]
*  If Bongino says it or just fill in [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=468.68s)]
*  the blank for any other right wing [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=470.76000000000005s)]

*  I just think that oftentimes and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=501.28s)]
*  history is proof of this whenever [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=503.56s)]
*  those clashes happen between Donald [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=505.88s)]

*  administration, Trump somehow [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=512.56s)]
*  manages to get his base to side [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=514.96s)]
*  with him and turn on the individual [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=516.96s)]
*  who disagrees with him. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=519.28s)]
*  Yeah, so look, of course, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=520.84s)]
*  because he's the leader, right? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=522.24s)]
*  And so if Biden and plus he's [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  developed a culture personality, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=526.12s)]

*  And it's a historic one. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=530.4s)]
*  And so, and by that I don't mean [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=532.84s)]
*  like in a derisive way. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=535.08s)]
*  I mean, people believe in him [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=537.2s)]
*  because they think that he's [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=538.72s)]
*  the first guy who ever fought back [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=540.1600000000001s)]

*  You can disagree with that, but [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=542.96s)]
*  that's their earnest belief, right? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=544.2s)]
*  So that's why they're so animated, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  like we were animated with Bernie, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=547.48s)]
*  right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=549.2s)]
*  But if Bernie is like going up [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=549.8s)]
*  against like Richie Torres and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=551.52s)]
*  say Richie Torres is like, no, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=553.36s)]
*  this is illegal. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=555.08s)]
*  We should definitely help [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=556.08s)]
*  Israel more, right? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=557.52s)]
*  And Bernie fires and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=558.72s)]
*  we're going to side with Bernie, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=559.68s)]
*  right? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=561.36s)]
*  But if it was, and again, name, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=562.0s)]
*  fill in the blank, I don't know, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=563.58s)]
*  crystal ball or someone that we [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=565.2s)]
*  like trust Ryan Grimm, David [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=566.8s)]
*  Sirota. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  And David Sirota comes in, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=568.96s)]
*  you should check out the lever, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=570.48s)]
*  check out all the work that all [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=572.2s)]
*  those folks do. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=573.74s)]
*  And says, Bernie's asking me to do [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=574.72s)]
*  something illegal or unconstitutional [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=576.52s)]
*  and that would have a lot more [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=578.72s)]
*  weight with me. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=580.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, okay, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=581.36s)]
*  I get what you're saying. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=581.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I totally get what you're [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=583.0s)]
*  saying. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=584.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it really depends on [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=584.76s)]
*  whether or not the public and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=586.44s)]
*  in this case, Trump's base trusts [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  the individual and has some [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=589.9200000000001s)]
*  credibility, like that individual [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=591.64s)]
*  has to have some credibility with [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=593.88s)]
*  the base in order to have some [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=595.88s)]
*  chance of getting the base to side [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=597.72s)]
*  with them in doing the right thing [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  and pushing back against Trump. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=602.0s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=603.88s)]
*  Look, it's difficult to comment on [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  some of these controversial figures [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=606.52s)]
*  getting appointed for these roles [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=608.24s)]
*  because they haven't had a day in [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=610.08s)]
*  the job yet. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=612.0400000000001s)]
*  So we'll see how he does and [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=612.9200000000001s)]
*  obviously we'll fill you in as that [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=614.36s)]
*  story develops. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=616.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, actually, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=617.32s)]
*  just last thing on that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=618.44s)]
*  Yeah, look, again, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=620.2800000000001s)]
*  what we're talking about is [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=621.32s)]
*  a percentage of a percentage of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  a percentage, it's unlikely to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=624.5200000000001s)]
*  happen in a lot of circumstances. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=626.2800000000001s)]
*  What's way more likely to happen is [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=628.24s)]
*  how they execute the job. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  We're all going to see that, right? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=631.2800000000001s)]
*  And all the downsides and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=632.6800000000001s)]
*  the upsides. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=633.88s)]
*  So if you say, hey, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  I already hate Dan Bongino and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=635.6s)]
*  I'm going to judge everything he [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=637.32s)]
*  does as 100% wrong and [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=639.04s)]
*  I don't need to look at it, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=640.28s)]
*  that's where I disagree, okay? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=641.84s)]
*  Now, if he says or [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=643.96s)]
*  does things that are right, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=645.12s)]
*  like Cash Patel just did and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=647.04s)]
*  we're shocked out of our minds, but [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=648.76s)]
*  we will say it is right, okay? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=650.96s)]
*  because it's our job to deliver [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=652.96s)]
*  the facts to you. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  If he does things that are wrong, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=655.4s)]
*  which is given the circumstance, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=657.16s)]
*  very, very likely, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=659.16s)]
*  they will come out and say what he [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=660.32s)]
*  did was absolutely wrong and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=662.24s)]
*  explain why. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=663.88s)]
*  That's how you should handle [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=665.0s)]
*  things based on what they actually [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=666.52s)]
*  do rather than what we think of [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=668.4s)]
*  them ahead of time. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JtR9bO4P1o&t=670.08s)]
