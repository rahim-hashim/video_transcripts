TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Trump Refuses SCOTUS Ruling On Returning Wrongly Deported Man
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8)
*  Your Supreme Court of course has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=0.0s)]
*  ruled that the United States [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=1.68s)]
*  government needs to facilitate [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  the return of the Maryland man [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=5.04s)]
*  mistakenly deported, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=6.72s)]
*  Kilmar Briego Garcia, being held [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=8.16s)]
*  inside El Salvador's mega prison. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=10.32s)]
*  However, inside the Oval Office [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  today in a meeting with President [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=14.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=16.68s)]
*  El Salvador's president, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=17.6s)]
*  Naib Kelly shut that down [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=19.44s)]
*  immediately said it's not going to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  happen this man's return. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=23.64s)]
*  But Kelly called the suggestion of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=25.48s)]
*  a Briego Garcia's return to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  the US preposterous. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=29.24s)]
*  Can President Bukele weigh in on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=32.48s)]
*  this? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=33.6s)]
*  Do you plan to return him? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=34.16s)]
*  Well, I guess I'm supposed to have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=35.48s)]
*  suggested that I smuggle a terrorist [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=37.04s)]
*  into the United States, right? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=38.92s)]
*  How can I return him to the United [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  States? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=42.28s)]
*  It's like I smuggle him into the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=42.8s)]
*  United States or whether I do it, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=44.48s)]
*  of course I'm not going to do it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=46.32s)]
*  It's like, I mean, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=48.0s)]
*  the question is preposterous. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=49.28s)]
*  How can I smuggle a terrorist into [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=51.76s)]
*  the United States? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=53.84s)]
*  I don't have the power to return [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=55.08s)]
*  him to the United States. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=56.8s)]
*  So leading up to that direct [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  question of the president from [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=61.52s)]
*  El Salvador was Caitlin Collins and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=63.36s)]
*  Stephen Miller, Trump aide saying, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=65.76s)]
*  look, how presumptuous for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=68.36s)]
*  you to believe that we can just [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=70.48s)]
*  usurp the authority of this sovereign [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=72.72s)]
*  nation and bring someone back [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=75.4s)]
*  who's under their control. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=79.28s)]
*  And then Caitlin Collins, CNN, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=80.6s)]
*  asked the question directly of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=82.48s)]
*  the president. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=84.36s)]
*  Well, will you return him to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=85.68s)]
*  the United States? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  So you heard the answer there. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=88.04s)]
*  Now attorneys with the Department [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=89.4s)]
*  of Justice filed their brief on [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=90.92s)]
*  Sunday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=92.2s)]
*  They argued that a federal court [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=92.7s)]
*  has no authority to direct [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=94.16s)]
*  President Donald Trump or [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=95.28s)]
*  his administration in bringing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=96.44s)]
*  home wrongly deported Maryland man [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=97.92s)]
*  Kilmar Borrego Garcia. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=99.64s)]
*  And she reject a request filed on [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=101.08s)]
*  his behalf by attorneys last week. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=103.04s)]
*  Mediate with the reporting here, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=105.32s)]
*  the court should deny plaintiffs [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=107.32s)]
*  requests for further relief. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=109.28s)]
*  The brief filed by the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=110.84s)]
*  administration reads, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=112.12s)]
*  the relief sought by plaintiffs is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=113.56s)]
*  inconsistent with the Supreme [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=115.56s)]
*  instruction requiring this court [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=117.2s)]
*  to respect the president's article [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=119.2s)]
*  to authority to manage foreign [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=121.36s)]
*  policy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=123.28s)]
*  Now the filing came after lawyers [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=125.04s)]
*  for Borrego Garcia and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  his family asked the court to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  compel Trump and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  the federal government to take [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=131.72s)]
*  steps to bring him back to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=134.0s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=135.8s)]
*  Borrego Garcia, citizen of El [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=137.8s)]
*  Salvador, was deported there by [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=139.72s)]
*  mistake. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=141.8s)]
*  The administration admits that, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=142.68s)]
*  an administrative error, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=144.76s)]
*  having legal permission to live in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=146.48s)]
*  the US where he spent the last 14 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=148.76s)]
*  years alongside his wife, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=151.16s)]
*  three children, all of them are US [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=152.96s)]
*  citizens. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  State Department official Michael [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=156.84s)]
*  Kozak filed an update on [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=159.0s)]
*  Borrego Garcia's status on Saturday [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=160.44s)]
*  indicating quote, well, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=162.88s)]
*  he is alive, secure in that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=164.72s)]
*  facility, he is detained pursuant [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=166.56s)]
*  to the sovereign domestic authority [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=169.2s)]
*  of El Salvador. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=172.0s)]
*  So not exactly, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=173.16s)]
*  proof of life, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=174.56s)]
*  you just got to take what they say. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=175.96s)]
*  I mean, that's what he's telling [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=179.0s)]
*  the court, the Trump [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=180.8s)]
*  administration, that's as far as [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=181.84s)]
*  they'll go from what we hear. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=183.8s)]
*  There's another hearing in federal [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=185.52s)]
*  court tomorrow where you can expect [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=187.6s)]
*  the judge to kind of ramp it up. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=189.56s)]
*  But it seems like in the last [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=191.2s)]
*  hearing, Cenk, the Trump [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=192.96s)]
*  administration officials are no [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=194.68s)]
*  longer stammering or kind of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=196.88s)]
*  cowering even in front of the bench. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=198.62s)]
*  They're basically saying, well, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=200.84s)]
*  this is what we're doing and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=203.84s)]
*  it's not much. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, maybe we shouldn't send [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=207.52s)]
*  people to a foreign prison if we [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  can't get them back. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=211.4s)]
*  And maybe we shouldn't send them [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD3J5U-G8-8&t=213.8s)]
