"President-elect Donald Trump would have been convicted of illegally trying to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election - which he lost - if he had not successfully been re-elected in 2024, according to the man who led US government investigations into him.

The evidence against Trump was "sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial," Special Counsel Jack Smith wrote in a partially released report."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

*  Sharply criticizing the president [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=9.78s)]

*  investigation, and suggesting that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=12.88s)]
*  Trump's actions warranted [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=14.96s)]
*  prosecution, saying that no, quote, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=16.52s)]
*  man in this country is so high that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=18.8s)]
*  he is above the law. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=20.8s)]
*  Well, there's big news today in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=24.2s)]
*  regard to special counsel Jack [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Smith, who has now officially [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=27.8s)]

*  investigation he conducted into [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=31.0s)]

*  overturning the 2020 presidential [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=35.44s)]
*  election. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=38.08s)]
*  Now he argues that if he hadn't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=39.4s)]
*  won the presidential election in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=41.48s)]

*  convicted for his role in election [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=45.8s)]
*  interference. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=48.28s)]
*  Now this comes after judge Eileen [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Cannon, who, let's just keep it [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=52.16s)]
*  real, as she oversaw both the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  classified documents case and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  Florida, and this federal case in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=58.6s)]
*  regard to election interference [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  really did help Trump every step [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=62.88s)]
*  of the way, did luckily decide to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=65.0s)]
*  allow Jack Smith to release this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  report. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=69.4s)]
*  Now the report is based on the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=70.0s)]
*  special counsel's interviews with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=72.0s)]
*  more than 250 people. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=74.4s)]
*  It also includes grand jury [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=76.2s)]
*  testimony from more than 55 [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=78.16s)]
*  separate witnesses. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=80.28s)]
*  Now, before we get to the details [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=82.04s)]
*  of the report, Cenk, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=84.28s)]
*  what are your thoughts so far? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=85.88s)]
*  Yeah, so here's what I'm tired of. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=88.08s)]
*  In the New York Times report about [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=91.12s)]
*  this, they said this was, quote, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=93.8s)]
*  an extraordinary rebuke. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=96.36s)]
*  No, it's actually a very ordinary [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=98.36s)]
*  rebuke because this is the same [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=100.6s)]
*  story that has happened over and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=102.6s)]
*  over again. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=104.84s)]
*  It's amazing that a former [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=105.6s)]
*  president has been rebuked like [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=107.44s)]
*  this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=109.64s)]
*  It's not amazing anymore. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=110.2s)]
*  He's been rebuked hundreds of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=111.8s)]
*  times. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=113.6s)]
*  I don't know when it's going to be [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=114.16s)]
*  released, but I think it's going [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=116.0s)]
*  to get through the New York Times [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  head, no one cares. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=119.72s)]
*  So look, in this case, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=120.92s)]
*  I wish they cared. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=122.12s)]
*  And that's going to get to the heart [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  of the story about the timing here. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=125.28s)]
*  And I thought Jack Smith said [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=127.2s)]
*  something interesting about [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=128.76s)]
*  the timing of the case and politics. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=130.28s)]
*  So I'm going to get to that in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=132.88s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=134.28s)]
*  But the rebukes are the most [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=135.32s)]
*  irrelevant thing in the world. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=136.72s)]
*  He got reelected, so all the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=138.04s)]
*  rebuking in the world didn't work. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, let me just get to the bulk of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=143.32s)]
*  the report. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=145.04s)]
*  It is, to Cenk's point, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=146.4s)]
*  a lot of what we already know, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=148.12s)]
*  right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=150.32s)]
*  But I think that Jack Smith's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=151.04s)]
*  opinion about how this all played [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=153.08s)]
*  out and Trump kind of being above [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=155.52s)]
*  the law is really interesting. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  So he says, the thorough line of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=160.28s)]
*  all of Mr. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=162.0s)]
*  Trump's criminal efforts was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=162.6s)]
*  deceit, knowingly false claims of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=164.28s)]
*  election fraud. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=166.4s)]
*  And the evidence shows that Mr. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=167.6s)]
*  Trump used these lies as a weapon [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=169.6s)]
*  to defeat a federal government [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=171.6s)]
*  that is foundational to the United [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=173.64s)]
*  States' democratic process. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  Further, the report indicates that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=177.56s)]
*  the department's view that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=179.88s)]
*  the Constitution prohibits [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  the continued indictment and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=183.24s)]
*  prosecution of a president is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=185.04s)]
*  categorical and does not turn on [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=186.92s)]
*  the gravity of the crimes charged, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=189.12s)]
*  the strength of the government's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=191.48s)]
*  proof or the merits of the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=193.76s)]
*  prosecution, which the office [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=195.56s)]
*  stands fully behind. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  Indeed, but for Mr. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=199.64s)]
*  Trump's election and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=201.2s)]
*  imminent return to the presidency, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=202.72s)]
*  the office assessed that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=205.24s)]
*  the admissible evidence was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=206.88s)]
*  sufficient to obtain and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=208.72s)]
*  sustain a conviction at trial. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  So to your point, Cenk, about how [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=212.4s)]
*  the media has been reporting about [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=214.16s)]
*  this, they're making a big deal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=216.0s)]
*  about it because Jack Smith is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=217.72s)]
*  saying in this report that he [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  believes Donald Trump without [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=221.12s)]
*  question would have been convicted. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  Had he not won reelection or [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=225.0s)]
*  election to a second term and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  the prosecution could move forward. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  To which I say, of course, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=231.88s)]
*  of course he thinks that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=233.56s)]
*  Why would he pursue prosecution if [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=235.32s)]
*  he didn't think that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=237.36s)]
*  Isn't that what he's supposed to, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=238.6s)]
*  I mean, why is this a breaking news [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=240.6s)]
*  story? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=242.68s)]
*  Yeah, of course he thinks that, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=243.24s)]
*  of course he does. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=245.16s)]
*  It would be weird if he was [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=246.24s)]
*  pursuing prosecution of someone [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=247.44s)]
*  that he thought was innocent. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=249.08s)]
*  But anyway, go ahead. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=250.68s)]
*  No, but Anna, you're hitting on [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=251.72s)]
*  the same thing that I was. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=253.8s)]
*  It's like these folks, they have [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  some weird standard in their head [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  where they think they're being [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=260.12s)]
*  objective by saying like, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=262.2s)]
*  this is extraordinary that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=264.32s)]
*  a prosecutor would say this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=266.24s)]
*  And it's not extraordinary. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=268.32s)]
*  By definition, if the prosecutor [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=270.76s)]
*  is trying to convict you, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  he thinks you didn't. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  It's not extraordinary, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=277.28s)]
*  stop saying stupid stuff. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=278.64s)]
*  And Eli Honig, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=280.28s)]
*  the legal analyst on CNN, look, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=281.32s)]
*  he's an interesting cat. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=283.76s)]
*  And I like that he's unbiased and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=285.88s)]
*  sometimes he'll correct [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=287.88s)]
*  a Democratic leading analyst on [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  something that's legal but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=291.44s)]
*  supports Trump. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  And I go, yeah, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=294.2s)]
*  that's a good point or [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  that's an interesting point. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  But in this case, he was like, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  it seems like Jack Smith made this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=298.44s)]
*  personal and was ranting. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=300.32s)]
*  No, he was laying out his case, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=302.64s)]
*  that's what a prosecutor does. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=304.67999999999995s)]
*  And he didn't make it personal, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  Trump made it personal. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=308.67999999999995s)]
*  Trump then responded to this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=310.2s)]
*  report by going deranged Jack Smith [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  and blah, blah, blah, blah, right? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  He always does. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=317.76s)]
*  So sometimes when they overdo it on [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  this, well, we're just trying to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=320.88s)]
*  be fair, well, this is, I don't [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  know, it's just, I feel like with [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=325.72s)]
*  media you never get a straight, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  normal, authentic answer, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=330.76s)]
*  And so none of this was [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=334.24s)]
*  extraordinary. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=335.64s)]
*  What Trump did was extraordinary, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=336.92s)]
*  but unfortunately, we're never [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=338.72s)]
*  going to get a jury to rule on that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  because of Merrick Garland. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  Which if you don't mind, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=343.76s)]
*  Anna, then leads me to this quote [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=344.68s)]
*  that I found to be super [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=346.12s)]
*  interesting in his report. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=347.12s)]
*  He said, given that, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=349.12s)]
*  this is a direct quote from [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  Jack Smith, given the timing and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=351.68s)]
*  circumstances of the special [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=353.4s)]
*  council's appointment and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=354.92s)]
*  the office's work, it was unavoidable [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=356.44s)]
*  that the regular processes of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=358.68s)]
*  the criminal law and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=360.44s)]
*  the judicial system were drawn [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=361.64s)]
*  parallel to the election campaign. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=363.44s)]
*  Now you could take that in [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=366.64s)]
*  a couple of directions. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=367.6s)]
*  You could look at that and go, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=368.6s)]
*  aha, if you're a Republican, go, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=370.08s)]
*  see, they claim it was inevitable [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=371.88s)]
*  that it had to be at the same time [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=373.52s)]
*  as the election, right? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=375.16s)]
*  It wasn't inevitable. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=376.68s)]
*  And here, Jack Smith, in a different [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=378.44s)]
*  interpretation, his interpretation [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=380.52s)]
*  is, look, brother, I got this job [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=382.72s)]
*  and then I was supposed to get this [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=384.56s)]
*  done super quickly, but it wound up [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  being in the middle of this [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=388.24s)]
*  election. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=389.56s)]
*  And then Trump used every excuse [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=390.36s)]
*  related to the election to delay [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=392.32s)]
*  the proceedings. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=394.4s)]
*  Yes, but [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=396.52s)]
*  you guys should have known that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=397.02s)]
*  Of course he was going to do that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=398.76s)]
*  Was he not going to defend himself? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=399.76s)]
*  And in fact, Jack Smith, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  a couple of times, this is the part [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=403.04s)]
*  that I'll criticize him for, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=404.64s)]
*  complained like, because of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=406.16s)]
*  the election, Trump got to use all [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=407.72s)]
*  these tactics to delay. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=409.48s)]
*  No. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=410.56s)]
*  Why didn't you prosecute him two [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=411.06s)]
*  and a half years earlier? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  Then he wouldn't have had those [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=414.56s)]
*  abilities. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=416.16s)]
*  And that's why I said Jack Smith [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=416.88s)]
*  didn't appoint himself. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=418.64s)]
*  Merrick Garland made that decision [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=421.16s)]
*  and he made it two and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=422.96s)]
*  a half years too late. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=424.0s)]
*  I don't know if he wanted it to be [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  in the middle of the election [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=427.24s)]
*  cycle, but I think that's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=428.56s)]
*  a potentially legitimate argument [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=430.08s)]
*  to make if you're on the right [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=432.32s)]
*  wing or if you're on any wing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=434.24s)]
*  And what I do know is we're never [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=436.6s)]
*  going to find out a definitive [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=438.72s)]
*  jury decision on Donald Trump. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=440.82s)]
*  Because Merrick Garland was [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  absolutely negligent as he sat on [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=445.2s)]
*  his hands for two and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=447.48s)]
*  a half years not bringing this case. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=448.92s)]
*  So the final thing that I'll bring [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=451.88s)]
*  up for this story is how hard [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=453.8s)]
*  Donald Trump and his legal team [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=455.64s)]
*  fought to prevent the release of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=457.72s)]
*  special counsel Jack Smith's report. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=459.88s)]
*  And I don't know why he even wastes [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=463.2s)]
*  any of his energy or [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=465.52s)]
*  resources on that because, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=466.84s)]
*  shockingly, Judge Eileen Cannon [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  did allow for the release of this [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=471.0s)]
*  report despite the protests coming [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=473.11999999999995s)]
*  from Trump and his legal team. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=475.4s)]
*  And for the most part, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  it's a big nothing burger. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=478.76s)]
*  Again, I do think that special [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=480.35999999999996s)]
*  counsel Jack Smith is correct in [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=482.32s)]
*  that Trump did interfere with [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=484.23999999999995s)]
*  the election, did attempt to go [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=486.09999999999997s)]
*  against the will of the American [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=488.11999999999995s)]
*  people and overturn the election. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=490.03999999999996s)]
*  I think that someone like Trump [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=492.16s)]
*  should face consequences for that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=493.54s)]
*  But because of how all this played [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=495.0s)]
*  out and because of the timing, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  he will not face consequences for [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=497.68s)]
*  it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=499.04s)]
*  But I just bring this all up [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=499.54s)]
*  because I don't think this is [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIGfnuCf2XE&t=500.68s)]
