"Quite a scandal: Biden was prepared to spend a few hundred thousand dollars on Teslas for the State Department, and the Trump administration altered that to $400 million, then back-dated the records to make it look like Biden did it.

State canceled the contract after @DropSiteNews exposed it.

DOGE should ask us for tips in saving actual money for the taxpayer, beyond just canceling Reuters subs"

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump BUSTED Hiding Plans To Give Tesla $400 Million
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc)
*  But if there is a conflict of interest when it comes to you yourself, for instance, you've [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=0.0s)]
*  received billions of dollars in federal contracts. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=4.44s)]
*  When it comes to the Pentagon, for instance, which the president I know has directed you [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=7.88s)]
*  to look into. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=11.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=12.16s)]
*  Are you policing yourself in that? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=13.16s)]
*  And you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=14.16s)]
*  It's totally obvious. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=17.68s)]
*  I fully expect to be scrutinized and get a daily proctology exam, basically. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=18.68s)]
*  I just want to camp out there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=22.96s)]
*  So it's not like I think I can get away with something. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=26.32s)]
*  Well, Elon Musk certainly loves to act like he's the king of transparency. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=30.96s)]
*  He's letting Americans know exactly what he's doing, how he's doing it, why he's doing it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=36.24s)]
*  But the story of Tesla potentially receiving a $400 million government contract has even [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=40.84s)]
*  more twists and turns than we originally knew. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=48.44s)]
*  Now new revelations indicate that Donald Trump and Elon Musk were in fact engaged in some [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=52.0s)]
*  incredibly shady dealings. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=58.88s)]
*  So let's get into what the details are. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=61.56s)]
*  Ryan Grim of DropSight News first broke the news of this contract. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=63.88s)]
*  Originally, he reported that the State Department's procurement forecast revised as of late December [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=69.12s)]
*  2024, lists Tesla as the recipient of the largest expected contract with Marco Rubio's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=77.28s)]
*  department planning to buy $400 million worth of armored Tesla. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=84.48s)]
*  The procurement forecast is listed as having been modified on December 13th, 2024, a month [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=90.8s)]
*  after Donald Trump's election. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=97.16s)]
*  Now look, it was after Donald Trump's election, obviously, but he hadn't been inaugurated [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=99.6s)]
*  yet. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=103.88s)]
*  He wasn't in office yet. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=104.88s)]
*  It was still in the transition phase between Biden's White House and Trump's White House. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=105.96s)]
*  But in other words, the State Department would have issued a contract under Biden, not Trump. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=112.72s)]
*  And I remember reporting the story at the time accurately, because everyone else in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  the media, including Rachel Maddow, was presenting it as if it was Trump and not Biden, who agreed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  to that kind of spending or grant toward Elon Musk's company. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  But the acquisition plan was set in motion by the Biden administration last year as part [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=135.85999999999999s)]
*  of a move to convert the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's fleet of roughly 3,000 armored [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=140.34s)]
*  vehicles into zero emission electric vehicles by 2023. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=145.94s)]
*  And by the way, that made sense. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=149.54s)]
*  I don't believe for a second that someone like Donald Trump is looking to have the federal [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=151.22s)]
*  government buy a bunch of EVs. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=156.38s)]
*  He's not really one of these people who has any concern about the climate emergency or [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=164.06s)]
*  But there's another twist, guys. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=165.94s)]
*  There's another twist, because NPR actually got a hold of the document that suggests [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=167.58s)]
*  Trump was in fact planning to reward Musk with significantly more government money. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  So let's get into the details on that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=181.12s)]
*  NPR has obtained a State Department document detailing that Biden's State Department planned [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=182.94s)]
*  to spend $483,000 in the 2025 fiscal year on buying electric vehicles and $3 million [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=188.02s)]
*  for supporting equipment like charging stations. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=197.02s)]
*  So it wasn't $400 million, it was $483,000. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=201.02s)]
*  It represented less than 1% of the hundreds of millions of dollars likely destined for [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=208.22s)]
*  Tesla vehicles after the Trump administration quietly revised a State Department procurement [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=214.42s)]
*  document. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  So Biden's State Department and Tesla had agreed to conduct research about armoring [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=223.42s)]
*  electric vehicles, but no money had been set aside to purchase armored Tesla. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  So while the State Department procurement document showering $400 million for Tesla [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=236.76s)]
*  was alleged to have been published in December, it doesn't appear in the Internet Archive [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  for that month. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=252.0s)]
*  So to sum up, as Ryan Grim explains, quite the scandal. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  Biden was prepared to spend a few $100,000 on Teslas for the State Department and the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=258.68s)]
*  Trump administration altered that to $400 million, then backdated the records to make [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=265.52s)]
*  it look like Biden did it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=273.4s)]
*  State canceled the contract after drop site news exposed it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, special thanks to drop site news for doing journalism, which is hard to come by [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=282.28s)]
*  in this country, unfortunately. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=287.68s)]
*  So that's what really happened. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  Okay, I can't believe that this is something that would happen, of course, of course. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=292.76s)]
*  How shady and disgusting is that? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=299.68s)]
*  So was this an accident or intentional? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=302.56s)]
*  A former Biden White House official familiar with the State Department's plans says, I [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=304.68s)]
*  don't think this is a clerical error. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=309.36s)]
*  It was likely someone who is new in the State Department who decided, okay, we're gonna [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=312.24s)]
*  do this with Tesla. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=317.24s)]
*  Guys, do you really think that Elon Musk poured in hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=319.44s)]
*  campaign coffers out of the kindness of his own heart? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=325.6s)]
*  You don't think that he's expecting anything in return, namely, federal government contracts [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  paid for by the American taxpayer? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=334.2s)]
*  Of course that's the case, of course. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=336.48s)]
*  The FAA just yesterday announced a massive contract for Starlink. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=339.6s)]
*  And look, again, there have been many federal government contracts for Elon Musk's businesses. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=347.8s)]
*  But it wasn't in the context of Elon Musk essentially being the unelected president [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=355.04s)]
*  of the United States, which it increasingly feels like he is. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=360.62s)]
*  Now, when asked about the deal, the Trump administration said it was put on hold. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=365.32s)]
*  A State Department spokesperson says that the Department of State has no intention to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=370.56s)]
*  move forward with the solicitation. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because you got caught and luckily they backed off. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=376.4s)]
*  But it seems like Trump's own lackeys expected this kind of blatant corruption and wanted [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=380.35999999999996s)]
*  to get in on the robbery. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=385.05999999999995s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, she's chair of the Doge subcommittee. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  After she was named chair, she bought Tesla stock. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=392.88s)]
*  How much did she buy? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=395.96s)]
*  We don't know exactly because the House ethics rules just require members of Congress to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=398.9s)]
*  report them in kind of broad ranges. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=403.64s)]
*  So she made four purchases. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=405.92s)]
*  Each purchase was between $1,000 and $15,000. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=408.12s)]
*  They went to four different accounts. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=411.44s)]
*  So the total is anywhere between $4,000 and $60,000 worth of Tesla stock. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=413.12s)]
*  She had already owned some Tesla stock as well that she reported on. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=418.74s)]
*  But this was a substantial pickup to her holdings in the company. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=421.6s)]
*  And now she is working with Elon Musk and he's been accused of slashing government to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=426.04s)]
*  his own benefit there. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=434.16s)]
*  It was the reports that DoD had a contract to buy Tesla cyber trucks. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=435.6s)]
*  So it does seem opportunistic in some ways to all of a sudden you have oversight over [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=440.8s)]
*  this person running a government agency. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpjVq8P0jyc&t=446.04s)]
