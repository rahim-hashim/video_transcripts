# Fetterman's TROUBLING New Friend
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8)
*  Democratic Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman is facing quite a bit of backlash over a recent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=0.0s)]
*  dinner that he had with one of MAGA's confidants. And that person, of course, was Steve Bannon? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=5.68s)]
*  Okay, but there's more to the story than that, so hold on. On Tuesday, Politico wrote [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=14.08s)]
*  in this week's edition of their playbook that, eyes emoji spotted, okay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=18.88s)]
*  John Fetterman, the not uncontroversial Democratic Senator for Pennsylvania, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=25.92s)]
*  dining in DC's top MAGA hangout Butterworth's on Monday evening. Fetterman was joined by [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=31.68s)]
*  Breitbart's Matt Boyle, plus for a good 20 minutes or so, Steve Bannon. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=40.24s)]
*  So this took place Monday, June 9th. Keep that date in mind because it is relevant. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=46.88s)]
*  So you and I will kind of go back and forth about what we think about him having dinner [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=53.28s)]
*  with someone from Breitbart and Bannon. But Josh Dropp, when someone pointed out that this dinner [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=57.68s)]
*  apparently happened on Fetterman and his wife's 17th wedding anniversary. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=66.0s)]
*  Heads would roll. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=71.12s)]
*  That's a heads would roll. Yeah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=83.92s)]
*  Yeah, I can't look at first of all, I didn't even realize Breitbart still existed, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  but shouts to them. I'm assuming Stormfront still does too. If Breitbart is still out there, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=93.28s)]
*  it's just relics of the early 2000s for me. This doesn't rank in the top 20 most annoying things [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=100.24s)]
*  John Fetterman has ever done, in my opinion. Yeah, there have been so many offenses that like, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=111.36s)]
*  you had dinner with Steve Bannon. I mean, you kind of showed your whole ass earlier. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  But Steve Bannon was only 20 minutes he hung out. He didn't even have the juice to have a full [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=122.0s)]
*  dinner with Bannon. He hung out with a Breitbart dude. That just shows you like, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=126.64s)]
*  Bannon was like, what's up? It's a senator. Bannon understands power and how power works. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=133.36s)]
*  He's like, yo, this guy's a US senator. I'll say what up to him for 20 minutes. But this dude was [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  hanging out with a Breitbart dude at a known MAGA hangout. So let me ask you something, and I'm not [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=144.32s)]
*  a medical expert. I know you're not either, but maybe you might know more than I do. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=152.16s)]
*  Was he always lying during his campaign or do strokes literally change your whole political [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=158.72s)]
*  identity? I think he probably was always a pretty ornery dude. And then the stroke made him more [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=165.68s)]
*  cutely so. That's what I'm gonna assume. The Israel stuff I think was just a straight up, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=178.08s)]
*  this dude probably kind of was pretty pro and then the APAC people got their hooks into him. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  And he's doing that. He was bad on Israel during his campaign. So that didn't surprise me. I mean, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  the vociferous nature of his support surprises me a little bit. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=201.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, in reference to that where his whole stick, I'm an everyman, I wear hoodies and shorts [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  to everything. Then Netanyahu gives a speech to Congress and you wear a suit. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=213.36s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  That's when I was like, yo, this dude is a freaking clown. That's when I jumped, I was like, oh, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  you are really trash. Like really like, yeah, no, no, no, Israel's president. I need to step up. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFbs2HHqXX8&t=226.24s)]
