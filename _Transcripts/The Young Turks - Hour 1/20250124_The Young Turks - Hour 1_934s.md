"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to promote the advancement of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. and to work toward potentially developing a national digital asset stockpile.

Venture capitalist David Sacks, who Trump tapped as his crypto and artificial intelligence czar, joined Trump in the Oval Office for the signing of the order.

‚ÄúThe digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation‚Äôs international leadership,‚Äù the order states."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# This Trump Exec Order Will DEFINITELY Cause The Next Great Financial Crash
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c)
*  President Donald Trump signed yet another executive order yesterday. In this case to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=0.0s)]
*  promote cryptocurrency in the US, which if I'm not mistaken, I think he has billions of dollars [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=4.64s)]
*  invested in which would seem to be somewhat of a conflict of interest. Am I out of something there? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is one of the things I'm most worried about because trashing the Constitution, etc. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=15.44s)]
*  is so extreme. And it would take, they'd have to use up all their power and then probably get [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=21.36s)]
*  burned on and it would probably end disastrously not just for the country but for Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=27.28s)]
*  But on this crypto stuff, they're gonna do that. And my prediction is it's going to cost us [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=31.76s)]
*  an unreal amount of money. So this is the thing you should be focused on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  I have that concern. I have a related concern, which we'll get to. But I do want to give people [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=44.08s)]
*  a little bit of the text from the executive order. It says the digital asset industry plays a crucial [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=47.84s)]
*  role in innovation and economic development in the United States as well as our nation's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=53.2s)]
*  international leadership, which proves that you can literally type anything you want into an [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=58.64s)]
*  executive order. And you just put it there and it's just words. It doesn't have to mean anything or [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  be true or be connected to anything, but he said it. And shortly after the order was issued, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=66.16s)]
*  the SEC rolled back accounting guidance that had deterred banks from getting involved with crypto. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=72.08s)]
*  So I hadn't really thought about another great recession being caused by cryptocurrency, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=77.68s)]
*  but I think we just took another big step towards that because all they've ever wanted to do [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=83.68s)]
*  is gamble. That's all crypto is and they're now being told, no, it's totally cool. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=88.64s)]
*  You can just take people's money and then gamble it in cryptocurrency. That seems like a disaster [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  waiting to happen. Additionally, he announced that his administration will evaluate whether to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=97.84s)]
*  create a quote, national digital asset stockpile, making good on a promise to support the use of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=102.64s)]
*  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. You know how we have a national reserve of oil in case of an emergency? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=108.64s)]
*  This way, in case we desperately need Bitcoin or Doge or something, it'll be there just in case. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=116.64s)]
*  Now he didn't actually set it up and some crypto advocates had been pushing for that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=122.8s)]
*  So this does not go as far as they perhaps wanted. They say that Bitcoin is the new [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=127.28s)]
*  digital gold, which doesn't mean anything, but it sounds kind of cool in a techie sort of way. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=134.16s)]
*  And they say we need to have a reserve just like we do with gold as if they're similar. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=139.2s)]
*  So anyway, the big issue that I have with this is that Donald Trump, like with TikTok, was very [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=144.88s)]
*  clear in his first term, it's a scam. And he is now very supportive of it. Now I'm not calling [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=151.04s)]
*  that hypocritical because I don't think he's changed his mind. I think he knows very well [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  that it's still a scam. But he also found out this week that he can make literally billions of dollars [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  by being a part of the scam. So that's worrying that what he does here will have ramifications [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=166.88s)]
*  for his own wealth beyond anything you can imagine. The stuff they were saying about Hunter [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=172.56s)]
*  Biden making money and Joe Biden, that is orders of magnitude smaller than what we're seeing here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=178.08s)]
*  Also, the crypto lobby already put more than $130 million at a congressional races the last [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=183.28s)]
*  time around. So there's a huge financial component there for elections. But also, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  my biggest fear, and maybe I'm panicking, you let me know, is he set up his meme coin or whatever. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=193.28s)]
*  And cryptocurrency is very difficult to track. Huge sums of money are going around. You can be [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=200.08s)]
*  an international person living in another country. What is stopping basically untraceable massive [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=206.08s)]
*  sums of money being transferred to Donald Trump and his family through this coin or through his [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=211.84s)]
*  actual crypto platform that he set up where presumably that would be very buttressed by [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  this sort of executive order. I feel like we've been focusing a lot on the evil of the last few [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=222.08s)]
*  days. But I think the corruption might dwarf the cruelty and the unconstitutionality. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  I think he has set up the possibility of bribery beyond any prior president's wildest fantasies. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=234.4s)]
*  That's only 100% true. So I think that here's how Trump's thinking on it when [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=241.36s)]
*  this crypto stuff's a scam. Wait a minute, this crypto stuff's a scam. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=248.72s)]
*  Remember, he's a legendary con man. He had a fake university. He had a fake charity. He had to pay [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=254.16s)]
*  fines for both of them, admit that he was guilty. And remember what he's famous for in business. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=259.6s)]
*  He always steps his investors. And he literally says, well, it's good business. You take their [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=265.76000000000005s)]
*  money and then you don't pay them back. No, that's not good business. That's just you being a con man. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=270.32000000000005s)]
*  So when he realized, my God, this is the con of all cons. He went con. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  God. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=280.32s)]
*  And so look, there's tons of bad news here. I'll give you a tiny bit of good news. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  As you guys, a lot of you know, been going on some right-wing shows or people that, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=290.96s)]
*  and everybody's all over the board. Some of them are not really quite right-wing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=295.44s)]
*  But I was on it with a guy who voted for Trump yesterday. And when I mentioned Trump's meme coin, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=299.28s)]
*  he's like, yeah, that's a scam. Yeah, meme coins are scams. And Trump's meme coin is definitely a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=305.52s)]
*  scam. So there are a lot of people who support Trump who are like, yeah, no, no, we get it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=311.12s)]
*  He's definitely robbing people there. Okay, so that's, and guys, remember, he's not robbing us. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=316.96s)]
*  So you don't have to put it like, I'm gonna tell you how he's gonna rob us in a second. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=321.76s)]
*  But you don't have to, he's gonna make billions. And if that drives you crazy, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=325.68s)]
*  I hear your brothers and sisters and it drives me crazy cuz he's never earned any of it, right? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=331.44s)]
*  In my opinion. But in this one, he's just robbing his own supporters. And his, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=335.68s)]
*  like the ring around him is robbing his supporters cuz they all buy in low. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=342.88s)]
*  Trump already has 80% of it, right? And so the way that they make money is when Trump's supporters [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=347.28s)]
*  come in and buy it and drive up the price and then they dump it on them. And so when they dump it on [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  them, and let's say that it started at $10 and went to $50 and it gets to $50, they sell. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=360.4s)]
*  So they just made $40 per share. These are all examples. So they're super happy. The Trump [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=367.12s)]
*  insider's got rich off of that. And then it'll go from 50 to zero. That's your $50. So if you're [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=372.88s)]
*  a MAGA, you're gonna lose that money. But you say, hey, I know it's speculation and I wanna get in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  and then dump it on some other sucker. Hey, that's your business, it's a free country. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  And then you get burned on it, it's a free country, okay? But there's two giant problems. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=389.76s)]
*  And I gotta get to Nina here because some of this actually affected her personally. But- [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=399.52s)]
*  Yeah, one is that other countries and companies and individuals can easily bribe Trump through [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=400.8s)]
*  this because you just buy his meme coin and he has 80% of it. He just keeps your money. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=408.08s)]
*  It's the easiest bribe in the world and you won't be able to stop it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=415.2s)]
*  So I think that is going to happen for four straight years. And I told you coming in, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  number one thing he's gonna do is rob the place cuz that's who he is. He's a robber, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=423.44s)]
*  right? All the moral stuff that we're worried about, that's all distraction. He doesn't care [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=427.28s)]
*  about that. If he thought he could effectively rob people by being a saint, then he would have [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=431.84s)]
*  been a saint, right? He's just distracting you with all the other stuff so that he can get rich [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  on this stuff. So now the main issue I have on the policy here is digital stockpile. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=441.76s)]
*  Wait a minute, when the crypto guys started all of this, they said we're doing this because we [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=448.64s)]
*  don't want government. Government is bad and we don't get your stinking government hands off our [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=454.64s)]
*  crypto. We don't want any government regulation. They're like, now it's worthless? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=461.2s)]
*  Government guarantees it, now it's worth something. Okay, isn't that a beautiful magic trick? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  Now, let me ask you guys this. I'm gonna read from CNBC of all places. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=472.4s)]
*  Crypto investors, crypto investors, companies and executives accounted for almost half of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=476.48s)]
*  corporate donations in the 2024 election cycle. The corporate donations in the cycle were monstrous, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=481.68s)]
*  were enormous, and they had half of them. Do you think they did that out of the goodness of their [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=490.8s)]
*  heart? Just because they care so much about the general welfare. Or do you think they thought, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  well, who cares if we put in 100 million, 200 million, or 400 million? We're gonna take [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  billions of fake money and have the American taxpayers guarantee it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=506.16s)]
*  And if things go badly, we'll just take it from the American taxpayers. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=510.64000000000004s)]
*  So of course it's worth it to do endless bribes, because we're gonna make 10 times, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=515.44s)]
*  100 times that money. So that robbery is headed like a freight train right towards you. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=520.32s)]
*  And I know the right wing will never believe it. And at this point, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=525.84s)]
*  the right wing loves crypto more than they love Trump. So this is the thing they'll get most angry [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=529.2s)]
*  about. They'll be livid and, but you don't understand crypto, you don't understand Bitcoin, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=534.4s)]
*  you don't understand this. We got this. Well, if you got this, then don't come and ask us [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=539.68s)]
*  to back up your fake money. I don't want my real money and taxpayer money going to your fake money. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=545.76s)]
*  I know what they're gonna say now, it's not fake, you don't know anything about it, good. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=553.52s)]
*  If it's real, then you keep it, enjoy it. It's a free country, go nuts with it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  Don't ask me to guarantee it. If it's real, it's real. The only reason you want me to guarantee it [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=560.96s)]
*  is because it's fake and you know it's fake. Go and cry about it. All right, Nina, this affected [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  you because they said these crypto bros spent the money against you. And you're gonna win that seat [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=572.48s)]
*  in Ohio until these sons of bitches came in. That's exactly right, Cenk. I'm having flashbacks [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=577.6s)]
*  just listening to you and John talk. Bankman Fried was the main one. Yes, crypto came in [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  like a storm. And I remember like it was yesterday getting a call from one of the people working on [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=590.4s)]
*  my campaign saying that he had heard the rumor that Bankman Fried was gonna jump into this race, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=596.16s)]
*  that he was gonna make some calls and try to head it off. It was all crypto. It was all based on me [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  believing that both Israelis and Palestinians have a right to safety, security, freedom, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=608.0s)]
*  those little things like that. But yeah, it came in like a storm. And the same thing happened [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=615.52s)]
*  we know to Bush and also to Bowman. And as you just laid out, Cenk, the amount of money that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=620.16s)]
*  they spent both on the Democratic side and the Republican side because both of these parties [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=625.68s)]
*  are captured. I want our audience to understand this. They are captured by corporate power. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=631.12s)]
*  This is crony capitalism at its worst in our face. And as far as President Donald J Trump [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=636.64s)]
*  is concerned, he was against it before he was forward, before he was forward. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=643.36s)]
*  And as long as it works out for him, he is forward. And Cenk, your point about government [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=647.2s)]
*  get out of our way, only if government backs what we wanna have happen, then we like the government. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=653.2s)]
*  If it's not backing what we want, then we don't like the government. I hope that the everyday [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=659.04s)]
*  people of this nation are seeing that these folks are playing in our face, which is another reason [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=662.96s)]
*  why not just conscious minded folks should unite. We need working class people from all walks of life [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=668.96s)]
*  to come together. Because unless you have a trust fund, unless you have a sugar mama, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=674.24s)]
*  a sugar daddy or sugar somebody, we are all at peril with these fools. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=679.92s)]
*  He is like the wizard, don't look behind the curtain and definitely the shell game, baby. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=685.2s)]
*  This is what President Donald J Trump is doing, coming in the door. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=690.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have one more prediction because I made some bold predictions saying that Trump has some [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=694.88s)]
*  percent of chance of going right in some policy issues, right? A small minority of issues and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=700.4799999999999s)]
*  people got really mad about that, etc, right? So I'll make a bold prediction that the right [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=706.0s)]
*  wing get mad about, so we'll all be even, okay? So if they don't rob us at all through crypto [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=710.16s)]
*  in Trump's four years, I'll come back out and apologize and say I was wrong. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  No, they never ran any scam. They said they didn't need the government and they didn't use [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=722.7199999999999s)]
*  the government. They just did whatever they do and they run in their thing and they didn't use [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=728.0s)]
*  the government to rob the American people at all and I'll come out and say it, right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=734.16s)]
*  But I think they're almost definitely going to do that. And so that's my prediction. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=737.3599999999999s)]
*  And then when they do, there's something that they're miscalculating. David Sacks, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=742.0s)]
*  who's running this program and all the other people, Elon Musk and all these guys who are involved. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=747.3599999999999s)]
*  If I'm right and they take, look, I think the numbers will be so gigantic, it'll boggle the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=752.64s)]
*  imagination. If you take that much money from the taxpayers, you're inviting a wrath like you have [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=760.9599999999999s)]
*  never seen. Because the country's already a tinderbox. Well, we're already angry and we're [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=767.76s)]
*  already angry at the oligarchs and the elites and the donor class that keep taking and taking and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=772.8s)]
*  if like we weren't angry at the banks, we were angry at the oil companies, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=779.04s)]
*  we're angry at the pharmaceutical companies. But if the crypto bros and the oligarchs and [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=782.56s)]
*  the tech guys rob us even more, imagine the rage there's going to be in this country. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=787.92s)]
*  And not just from the left, but also from the right who got robbed. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=793.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=796.88s)]
*  So buyer beware all around. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=797.76s)]
*  Yeah, and if he is ripping off right wingers, I mean, we've already seen over the last year [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=801.52s)]
*  their willingness to engage in political violence, the attempts on Trump's life from [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  MAGA people like it could be even worse. I'll say on that look, two, two, two. I hope [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=809.76s)]
*  none of that happens. I hope nothing physical ever ever ever happens to anyone on any political side. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=814.96s)]
*  I'm just being realistic with you guys that there's only so much the donors can poke the [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=821.12s)]
*  average American. There's only so much the donors can take from the average American [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=825.5200000000001s)]
*  before people go weak. I don't give a goddamn what media says, whether it's mainstream [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=829.0400000000001s)]
*  media or right wing media. I got eyes and ears. It's the freaking donors. The donors control [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=833.76s)]
*  everything. And then Trump said he was gonna drain the swamp and that he wasn't gonna be [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=839.2s)]
*  controlled by the donors. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=844.4s)]
*  And if his donors rob us, I'm telling you, not just the left, not just independence, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  but a portion of his base is gonna go, you son of a bitch. You were just another trick, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=851.2s)]
*  another trap for the donors to rob us again. And it will be a straw that breaks the camel's back. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna send everyone a break with a prediction. So I already predicted [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=863.92s)]
*  the SEC telling banks they should invest in crypto. That's your next big recession. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=868.48s)]
*  They should start planning the next movie, the next big short. The second one is crypto got [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=873.04s)]
*  massively into the elections. They're gonna start first perhaps advertising on CNN, MSNBC, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=878.56s)]
*  Fox News. And then they're gonna start investing to control those networks because they're gonna [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=885.28s)]
*  need hosts going on there and telling people like maybe this is a good idea. They buy CNBC [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=888.88s)]
*  or they get involved with Fox Business. They start telling people like, yeah, no, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=893.6s)]
*  I know it's failing constantly. And Donald Trump is basically he's put out [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  Hawkeye or whatever, but you should get involved in it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=900.32s)]
*  I feel like that could be the next big thing the same way pharma and big energy has. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=903.44s)]
*  Playback of our exclusive member only shows and specials right after they air. So all that, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG2Qfabda3c&t=923.9200000000001s)]
