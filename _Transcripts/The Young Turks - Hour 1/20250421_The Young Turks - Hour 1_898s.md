"Podcast host Joe Rogan warned against becoming ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù while ‚Äúfighting monsters‚Äù as he discussed ‚Äúover-correction‚Äù on illegal immigration and crime, such as abandoning due process in deportations of suspected gang members.

On Thursday‚Äôs episode of The Joe Rogan Experience from Spotify, Rogan was joined by comic and podcast host Deric Poston for a typically wide-ranging interview, during which they touched on illegal immigration and deportations like that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia."

# Joe Rogan DEMANDS Due Process For Kilmar Abrego Garcia
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg)
*  But then there's also legitimate arguments on the other side like the other side is making a very legitimate argument about the right to do process if you get [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=0.0s)]
*  Processed and shipped out of the country and put in a prison in El Salvador [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=8.48s)]
*  We have to make sure that these people are actually guilty. Otherwise, we become monsters [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=11.8s)]
*  You can't like what is that when you're fight monsters be careful that you don't become one come on. Yeah. Yeah, that's very important [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  It's very important key. No, you can't do that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=24.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is apparently eroding [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=27.88s)]
*  foundational American value so brazenly [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=32.08s)]
*  That Joe Rogan one of the individuals who endorsed Trump and voted for him in the last presidential election is now speaking out [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=35.3s)]
*  Against him now Donald Trump. Meanwhile is pulling new [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=42.72s)]
*  Unbelievable tricks to basically defend his administration's decision to deport Kilmar [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=46.22s)]
*  Abrego Garcia and he's also refusing to return him to the United States despite the fact that the Supreme Court has ordered him to do so [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=50.4s)]
*  But before we get to that here's more from Rogan [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  He had Tim Dillon on his podcast episode when he was making these points and Dylan seemed to agree with him as well [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=61.56s)]
*  But he's talking about the importance of due process here. Let's take a look here. It is Benjamin Franklin [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=68.08s)]
*  It's better hundred guilty person should escape than one innocent person should suffer. I'm on that side of things [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=73.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's my I mean [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=79.84s)]
*  I think due process exists for a reason and the reason is it is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=81.74000000000001s)]
*  Horrific for someone to be accused of something they didn't do be imprisoned for crimes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=85.68s)]
*  They didn't commit and then live in a cell live in a cage with a bunch of people who did commit that is wisdom [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that has survived hundreds of years. It's incredibly accurate and it is the foundation of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=97.68s)]
*  Freedom so that was actually the episode that he had with Derrick Poston [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=104.76s)]
*  But he also made similar points while Tim Dillon was on his show [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=109.38s)]
*  So he's been talking about this repeatedly which I'm grateful for because I think the points he's making here are incredibly important [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Due process is important. It doesn't mean that you are a fan of a Briego Garcia [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=119.97999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you want to be an advocate for him [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=124.88s)]
*  It means that you believe in the rule of law and due process when someone is accused of something in this case [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=126.94s)]
*  We have not gotten due process and it's not just Rogan who's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=132.98s)]
*  Honestly more left-leaning is like a more left-leaning Trump voter. It's also [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=136.6s)]
*  conservative, you know legal commentators like this guy named Andy Andy McCarthy [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  He was on Fox News and he also ripped the Trump administration on this. Let's take a quick look at that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=148.88s)]
*  There's no question that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=153.12s)]
*  He there was an order. He was not supposed to be sent as Senator Kennedy said that was a screw-up [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  I in 20 years at the Justice Department [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  I had plenty of screw-ups [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=164.84s)]
*  but the thing is when the government screws up it's supposed to fix it and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=166.28s)]
*  What these guys are basically saying is yeah, we screwed up. So what they've sent him to El Salvador [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  The government if it was doing the right thing the Trump administration should be trying to bring him back so he can have whatever proceedings [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=176.2s)]
*  He is entitled to to challenge his deportation. I don't understand what Attorney General Bondi is doing here, frankly [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=184.64s)]
*  So again, that was a conservative. Okay, you have Rogan [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=192.2s)]
*  you have a conservative legal commentator on Fox News making kind of similar points here about the importance of due process and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=195.42s)]
*  admitting when you've made a mistake which by the way the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=201.84s)]
*  White House lawyers have admitted in legal filings [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=204.92s)]
*  But you still have people like White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt denying that a mistake was made in deporting Abrego Garcia [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=207.64s)]
*  Yeah, so look on Abrego Garcia [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=215.0s)]
*  There's two issues that are important and and there's tons of confusion on about the other stuff that is not important [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=217.8s)]
*  so in 2019 the last order court order on [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=224.2s)]
*  Abrego Garcia is do not deport [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=228.76s)]
*  Period. Okay, so they deport him even though there's an outstanding court order saying do not deport this guy. Okay, so [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=232.8s)]
*  That means they have to bring him back period full stop [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=241.28s)]
*  There's a court order and then all the courts since then have confirmed there's a court order [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  You must return him including the Supreme Court nine to nothing, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=247.94s)]
*  And even Alito saying look I didn't like the way that we ruled and my colleagues ruled and etc, etc [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  But of course, he's got to bring him back because you have to listen to the courts and he's not gonna listen [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=258.44s)]
*  That's the thing the Trump administration refuses to listen [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=262.72s)]
*  They're playing this ridiculous game where they're like, I mean we can't we can't force Bukele to do it and then Bukele [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=265.72s)]
*  Okay, that's the president of El Salvador for those who don't know who I'm talking about [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=272.64s)]
*  But then Bukele is like I don't have the power to send him back to the United States. Okay, just stop [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=276.32s)]
*  Do you think we're stupid? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=280.92s)]
*  Like Trump and Bukele they're like [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=283.04s)]
*  Come on come on man. All right. So now the second thing that's super important about [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=287.96s)]
*  Abrego Garcia is it is not an immigration issue. It's a due process issue. Yes Rogan's a hundred percent, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=293.28s)]
*  It doesn't matter who Abrego Garcia is and it does and all of that is for the courts to decide not for Yahoo's on X [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=299.88s)]
*  And Instagram to decide right like oh, I think he's this I think he's I don't care what you think [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=307.56s)]
*  Sorry, okay. And by the way, the court shouldn't care what I think either [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=313.12s)]
*  They should do a real process because this isn't about his rights [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=316.48s)]
*  This is about our rights exactly because as Rogan is pointing out here if he doesn't have due process, we don't have due process [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  Period guys you have to get that through your head if the concept of due process does not exist anymore [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=328.4s)]
*  It doesn't exist for anyone. That means you don't have to go to court to arrest anyone deport anyone, etc [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=334.0s)]
*  It just means that the government okay the big bad government that conservatives complain about all the time can literally [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=340.2s)]
*  Unilaterally point to anyone accuse them of anything and punish them without due process [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=347.88s)]
*  We don't want to live in a country like that. It's that simple [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=354.22s)]
*  We don't want to live in a country like that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=357.04s)]
*  Look, I I know all about the reports in regard to Abrego Garcia, right? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=358.58s)]
*  The his wife had pursued a restraining order against him. Yada. Yeah, I get all that. I'm not like someone who's sitting here [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=363.78000000000003s)]
*  Specifically to talk about what a stand-up guy Abrego Garcia is it's not about him in particular [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=371.66s)]
*  It's about the rule of law and the fact that there is a process in place to prevent innocent people [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=376.14s)]
*  From getting inaccurately accused of crimes [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=382.9s)]
*  They did not commit and then being punished for crimes. They did not commit you get what I'm saying [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=386.06s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah and look here you can tell as usual [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=390.58s)]
*  We've been the one show that's principled and honest about this because under the Obama administration [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=394.02s)]
*  When they killed unaware all of Lockheed you were American citizen [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=399.34s)]
*  They claimed the due process was not necessarily judicial process and we went nuts over it [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=403.5s)]
*  And I thought that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=409.1s)]
*  You know the Attorney General there holders should have been fired instantly [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=410.54s)]
*  And I said I was embarrassed that he spoke at my graduation at Columbia and he's a you know [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=414.42s)]
*  One of the alumni there [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=419.44s)]
*  It's a lot of reasons to be embarrassed by Columbia these days, right because of course it's judicial process. What do you mean? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=420.38s)]
*  It's not judicial process. That's exactly what due process is [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=426.5s)]
*  So Obama was 200% wrong there and Trump is 200% wrong here [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=429.38s)]
*  But I love that you brought up Obama because it's a perfect example of something that we've been saying on this show for years now [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  When your guy when your preferred candidate wins the election as it and is in the White House if they carry out [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=441.5s)]
*  Acts that are counter to our constitutional rights if they behave badly [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=449.66s)]
*  They basically set a precedent that allows the second administration [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=455.58000000000004s)]
*  That might be run by a guy you don't like to carry out whatever they would like to carry out and in fact [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=460.06s)]
*  So I'll build on that real quick too because back then and when we're going we're living over that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=465.54s)]
*  Everybody said no, no, no, don't criticize Obama. Don't don't don't criticize Obama because what if the Republicans win? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=470.26s)]
*  What do you mean? What if the Republicans win? He already said that he'd like to destroy due process [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=476.02s)]
*  I don't need the Republicans to do worse. That's already terrible, right? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=479.96s)]
*  Yeah, and so look there's a thousand other factors that go into who you vote for right? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=483.7s)]
*  So I vote for those Republicans because I thought they would do things like this and I was really worried about [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=488.3s)]
*  Trump saying he wanted to terminate the Constitution and here we are constantly [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=492.98s)]
*  Trying to chip away at the Constitution for no reason. He had a giant win on immigration [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=497.02s)]
*  He closed down the border people loved it the polling went through the roof and then he comes in he's like, yeah [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=501.42s)]
*  But I don't want to follow the Constitution and now his polling is dropping ten points [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=506.54s)]
*  Yep, and so he turned a win into a loss why he wants to attack the Constitution [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=510.06s)]
*  But if you're on Trump's side, you don't want to hear it. No, no, no, I love it [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=515.2199999999999s)]
*  Attacking the Constitution is great when you were on Obama's side earlier if you were a Democrat and you didn't want to hear it [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=518.54s)]
*  And mainstream media by the way when Trump does it they go ballistic, right and they should good [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=523.38s)]
*  I agree with that when Obama did it almost no coverage at all [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=528.18s)]
*  Percent so speaking of the media going ballistic. I mean they keep asking, you know Trump to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=532.9s)]
*  Explain himself and explain how it is that it's totally okay [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=538.9799999999999s)]
*  to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=543.02s)]
*  Not listen to a Supreme Court ruling and continue, you know deporting people without due process [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=544.1s)]
*  Here's what Trump says if we don't get these criminals out of our country. We are not going to have a country any longer [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=549.0600000000001s)]
*  Okay, but who determines whether or not the individual you're accusing of being a criminal is actually in fact a criminal [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=555.38s)]
*  That's where the courts come in [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  And by the way again just to reiterate a brigo goscia was not in the country illegally [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=565.14s)]
*  Okay [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=570.1400000000001s)]
*  He was he had a legitimate asylum claim according to what the court said and he had protected status to remain in the United States [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=571.1s)]
*  So for those who are saying well, even if he's not an MS 13 gang member or a gang member in general who cares? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=578.74s)]
*  He was in the country illegally except he wasn't [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=584.2600000000001s)]
*  And Trump continues to say we cannot give everyone a trial [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=587.5400000000001s)]
*  We cannot give everyone a trial because to do so would take without [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=592.58s)]
*  Exaggeration 200 years we would need hundreds of thousands of trials for the hundreds of thousands of illegals [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=597.1s)]
*  We are sending out of the country [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=603.26s)]
*  Okay [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=605.1s)]
*  But what happens if you're accusing someone who's actually an American citizen of being in the country illegally and you deport that individual? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=605.38s)]
*  And not only that in this case, they didn't just deport him [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=611.98s)]
*  They sent him to a hellhole on El Salvador one of the worst prisons in the world [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=615.1s)]
*  And the reason they were told the court's order that he should not be deported is because he had a legitimate fear of being [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=618.54s)]
*  harmed by [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=624.34s)]
*  Gangs in El Salvador that prison is filled with gangs from El Salvador [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=625.7s)]
*  Like it could you couldn't have sent him to a worse place and you can do that without due process. That's crazy [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=629.98s)]
*  So look for me the last couple things here. So first off due process is the cornerstone of Western civilization [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=634.74s)]
*  So don't tell me we're not gonna have a country anymore if we do due process [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=641.82s)]
*  We literally won't have a country if we don't do due process [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=645.46s)]
*  Then we'll just have a normal authoritarian or dictatorial government that we vote that has been around forever and ever and ever what makes America [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=649.28s)]
*  Special and awesome is that we believe in Western civilization. We believe in those [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=655.74s)]
*  Foundational rights that we have as citizens and due process might be the single most important one [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=661.04s)]
*  That's why we were so upset at Obama earlier, right? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=667.0s)]
*  So and so last things from the members that dumpster dog writes in just as a fun part new processes woke [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=670.08s)]
*  And a lot of right-wingers are saying that I'll do process and nonsense guys [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=677.84s)]
*  It is I don't want to hear any of them complain if a Democratic president points to any of the conservatives and accuses them of a crime [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=682.2800000000001s)]
*  Punishes them for alleged crime without giving them a day in court. In fact, well, that's what this is [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=689.36s)]
*  Let's round up all the January 6 guys if a Democrat wins, let's just send them down Salvador [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=694.74s)]
*  So there's nothing we can do. We can't get him back. We can't get well how you can't do that [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=698.44s)]
*  Well, you don't have due process anymore. So we do anything we like so that's not America and Trisha Briggs [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=701.5600000000001s)]
*  Thank you for pointing that Joe Rogan making a good point again [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=706.4399999999999s)]
*  These are YouTube members hit the join button to become part of the show. She says are we in the upside down? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=708.92s)]
*  Yeah, but look guys, that's why everything including these hosts are not black and white [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=714.6999999999999s)]
*  No other shows want to tell you they're all black and white if they voted for Trump [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=720.24s)]
*  They're all Nazis and evil etc. And and by the way, Joe Rogan is not a leftist [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=723.52s)]
*  He has some left-wing positions some right-wing positions [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=727.9599999999999s)]
*  He's independent whether you like it or not and there's a whole bunch of his opinions [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=730.88s)]
*  I don't like but that's not how the world works. Oh, I don't like some of his opinions. Hence. He's a Nazi [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=734.9599999999999s)]
*  No, no [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=739.9599999999999s)]
*  And so in this case he did what I thought he would do which is actually stand up for our rights [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=741.24s)]
*  Right and no like let's be honest who on the left said he would no one right and he did and it makes a difference [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=748.4399999999999s)]
*  Because he's part of the guys who helped Trump win and if you say well, that's why I hate him [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  I hear you but he's also part of the guys now checking Trump, which is a good thing [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=760.18s)]
*  Okay, I hate when you say final thing because there's more that I want to know [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay. All right. So I want to talk just quickly about what Trump put out there in terms of evidence that a brigo Garcia is part [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=769.76s)]
*  of MS 13 [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=777.64s)]
*  So let's go to graphic one here. It's a post by Donald Trump. He's [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=779.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a photoshopped image by the way and in it [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=783.5999999999999s)]
*  He says this is the hand of a man that Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States because he is such a fine and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=786.92s)]
*  innocent person [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  They said he is not a member of MS 13 [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=795.0s)]
*  Even though he's got MS 13 tattooed on his knuckles and two highly respected courts found that he was a member of MS 13 [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=797.16s)]
*  Did they okay? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=804.28s)]
*  Beat up his wife, etc. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States among other things [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=806.12s)]
*  I must be allowed to do my job make America great again [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=812.52s)]
*  but look if let's take a [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=815.88s)]
*  tighter shot there we go of the alleged MS 13 tattoos [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=818.0s)]
*  The MS 13 was photoshopped onto the image. Those are not tattoos that he actually has [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=822.56s)]
*  The tattoos do include a marijuana leaf a [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=829.2s)]
*  Smiley face, I guess that's a sign of MS 13 [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=834.0s)]
*  And then there's a cross [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=837.88s)]
*  Cross I mean I heard people saying that Pete Hegs's shouldn't get the Secretary of Defense job because he had cross tattoos [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=840.52s)]
*  But maybe maybe this guy should get it [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=847.6s)]
*  Have you guys seen MS 13 tattoos or MS 13 gang members and the type of gang tattoos they have? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=849.64s)]
*  They have like MS 13 [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=855.32s)]
*  Scrawled across their forehead and okay, they're not doing like little little like secret symbols [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=857.88s)]
*  They're not like hey, how you doing cross? Okay, you should interpret it, right? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=863.52s)]
*  No a weed. Oh, wow weed that sounds super dangerous [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=868.76s)]
*  By the way, let the courts adjudicate whether or not he's actually a member of MS 13 [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=873.92s)]
*  What is the Trump administration so afraid of? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=878.28s)]
*  Yeah, and it's embarrassing for the president to put up a photoshopped picture. It's it's and get caught on it instantly [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=880.68s)]
*  Don't do what are you doing? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=887.68s)]
*  But I already said last thing every time you ring the bell below an angel gets his wings [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=889.48s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3DYMrDqEg&t=894.3199999999999s)]
