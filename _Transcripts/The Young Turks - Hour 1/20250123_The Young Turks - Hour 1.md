"The Trump administration‚Äôs pick for deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East brings a record on Iran, the Houthis and the region that is alarming pro-Israel conservatives, having described Iran‚Äôs missile attack on Israel as ‚Äúfairly moderate‚Äù and urged the U.S. against bombing the Houthis, instead calling for American pressure on Israel.

Michael DiMino, who was a military analyst at the CIA and an official at the Defense Department during the first Trump administration, has been a fellow at Defense Priorities, a Koch-funded isolationist think tank founded by allies of libertarian Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY). He has called for a reduced U.S. presence in the Middle East and argued that the U.S. does not have any critical interests in the region."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump RIPS Into John Bolton & Makes Surprising Pick For Important Policy Position
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY)
*  I thought he was a very dumb person, but I used him well because every time people saw me [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=0.0s)]
*  come into a meeting with John Bolton standing behind me, they thought that he'd attack them [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=6.16s)]
*  cuz he was a warmonger. He's the one that got us involved along with Cheney and a couple of others [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=11.52s)]
*  convinced Bush, which was a terrible decision, to blow up the Middle East. We blew up the Middle [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=16.96s)]
*  East and we left. We got nothing out of it except a lot of death. We killed a lot of people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=22.64s)]
*  and John Bolton was one of those guys, this stupid guy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Whatever that was, it needs to be injected in my veins because I loved those statements about the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  obvious warmonger John Bolton, who Donald Trump stripped of security clearance. And so a reporter [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=42.4s)]
*  asked him about that and he felt the need to call him a warmonger, call him dumb and call him out [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=50.56s)]
*  for being part of the neocon brain rot that led the United States to cause all sorts of trouble [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=56.0s)]
*  in the Middle East. And look, he's doing something else that's very surprising, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=65.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is, because he just selected someone who actually does not want to go to war in the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=70.8s)]
*  Middle East and wants to use diplomacy when it comes to Iran as the Deputy Assistant Secretary [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=75.6s)]
*  of Defense for the Middle East. In other words, he is one of the policy chiefs in the Pentagon [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=84.16s)]
*  who will be making decisions about our foreign policy in the Middle East. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=91.52s)]
*  So his name is Michael D'Amino and the man in question has quite a background. So he was a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=97.52s)]
*  military analyst at the CIA where he specifically focused on issues pertaining to counterterrorism. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  He's also a fellow at Defense Priorities, which is a Koch funded outfit. But [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=111.52s)]
*  the Koch brothers are actually isolationists. So in this one area, I agree with the Koch brothers [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=119.52s)]
*  because they wanna stop spending money on needless wars and an official with the Defense Department [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  during Trump's first term. So he did serve in Trump's first term, but he didn't have a role [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=132.96s)]
*  as significant as this. So people are already freaking out about that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=137.6s)]
*  And when I say people, I mostly mean neocon loyalists to Israel. As Jewish Insider put it, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=141.76s)]
*  the Trump administration's pick for Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  brings a record on Iran, the Houthis, and the region that is alarming pro-Israel conservatives, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=154.16s)]
*  having described Iran's missile attack on Israel as fairly moderate and urged the US against [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=161.84s)]
*  bombing the Houthis instead calling for American pressure on Israel. He has called for a reduced [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=168.32s)]
*  US presence in the Middle East and argued that the US does not have any critical interests [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=177.12s)]
*  in the region. Again, please inject this into my veins. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=184.08s)]
*  In fact, we have a snippet of the conversation that Jewish Insider is referring to. Let's take [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=188.08s)]
*  a look at that. Even if you believe that ISIS poses some kind of critical threat, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=193.84s)]
*  you have to look at how massively US capabilities, both military capabilities and Intel [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=200.4s)]
*  capabilities have changed over the past 20 years. We have over the rising capabilities, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  we're able to monitor ISIS in Afghanistan with absolutely no presence on the ground there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  There's no reason with all the other US bases in the region and even in Europe that we could do [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=215.52s)]
*  that, do something similar in Iraq and Syria if you're really concerned about the presence [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  of that group. But I'd argue really the reason that we're in Iraq and Syria is to sort of deny [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=226.08s)]
*  oil to the Assad regime in some kind of hope that that will ultimately lead to his ouster. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  And then really the answer, I think Mitch McConnell even made comments to this effect [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=236.4s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago, we're really there to counter Iran. And that's really at the behest [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  of the Israelis and the Saudis. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=244.48s)]
*  We're really in the Middle East to counter Iran at the behest of the Israelis and the Saudis. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=246.0s)]
*  That's what he said there. Now, that conversation took place in February of last year, which is why [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=253.76s)]
*  he was alluding to Assad still being in power. Now, de Mino said the United States can prevent [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=259.52s)]
*  terrorist threats emanating from the region without a major military presence, instead [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=265.68s)]
*  using diplomacy, leaning on local actors, intelligence monitoring and long-range strikes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=271.2s)]
*  He said the US should significantly reduce its troop presence in the region, remove military [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=279.84s)]
*  outposts in Iraq, Syria, and the Levant, and ultimately reassess its presence in the Gulf. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=284.88s)]
*  So I have more. This is just the beginning. We just barely scratched the surface. But [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=293.76s)]
*  oh my God. I mean, we haven't had anyone in the State Department, in the Pentagon, who is willing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  to call things as he sees it, who's willing to actually speak out about how we don't have [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=305.44s)]
*  any real interests in the Middle East. And we're really there specifically at the behest of Israel. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=311.84s)]
*  And so I think it's fascinating. And he had a lot to say about how the Biden administration [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  was helping Israel prosecute the war in Gaza, which we're gonna get to next. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=323.2s)]
*  But overall, I mean, this is a fantastic pick by Donald Trump, and he deserves some credit for that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=327.36s)]
*  Okay, this Michael DeBeno guy, love him. And there's a couple of reasons why. Number one, he's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=333.04s)]
*  correct, and he doesn't wanna get us into any more wars. And he doesn't think that we should [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  just be unilaterally serving Israel's interests or the Saudis' interests. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=344.24s)]
*  If you notice, he made a really good point. It's not just Israel that wants [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=348.48s)]
*  us to get into a war with Iran. It's Saudi Arabia. Saudis are Sunni, Iran is Shia. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  They compete in the Middle East, and the Saudis would like us to wipe out Iran on their behalf, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  so they could dominate the Middle East. And they are no less radical or fundamentalist [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  than the Iranian leaders. So what are we in the middle of a Sunni, Shia, Israel, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=366.56s)]
*  Iran fight for? Absolutely not. He's absolutely correct. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  And he's like, this is a rare guy. I was gonna say rare guy. I'm not sure I've ever heard [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=377.36s)]
*  a Republican or Democrat with a position this important saying obviously true things like, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=383.36s)]
*  we don't actually have a lot of interest in the Middle East. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=391.2s)]
*  We keep saying this is all existential to America. How is bombing Syria existential to America? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=394.88s)]
*  How is starting a new war on behalf of Israel existential to America other than doing us damage, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  right? Other than inviting a lot more terrorism against us. These things are enormously obvious [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=412.0s)]
*  to anyone who hasn't either been paid by the Israeli lobby or is doing propaganda on behalf [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=418.0s)]
*  of the Israeli lobby. We barely have any interest there. The only thing you could imagine is oil, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=424.0s)]
*  but right now we get plenty of oil from Saudi Arabia and the rest of them. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=429.6s)]
*  But and if we did a deal with Iran, we'd also get plenty of oil from Iran, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=432.8s)]
*  and our gas prices would be even lower. So it's amazing that any Republican or Democrat [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=436.88s)]
*  would pick this guy as the head of the Middle East in the Pentagon. So that's a great day [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=443.44s)]
*  in America. And my God, this is a litmus test too for anyone on the left. If you're opposed [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=449.28s)]
*  to this guy just because Trump picked him, you're not really on the left. You're just in a new party. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=454.88s)]
*  I don't know what it is, okay? A new part of the political spectrum. And one more thing for now [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=459.76s)]
*  that I have a lot more in a second. But yeah, guys, we told you there was a real tension [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=464.56s)]
*  within the right wing movement, MAGA, etc. On this issue, and here it is. And it's not just, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=469.52s)]
*  and I wanna be clear, it's not just going in this guy's direction. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=476.0s)]
*  On the other hand, you have all the establishment neo-con war hawks like Rubio, Stefanic, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=479.76s)]
*  and potentially Pete Hegseth who would be his boss. Actually, one of our viewers, HXC Mike, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=485.92s)]
*  says does it matter if he puts an anti-war Israel critic in that position if Hegseth [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=490.72s)]
*  is gonna oversee him? And that is the question. That's the central question in terms of foreign [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=494.64000000000004s)]
*  policy for Trump's second term. Is he gonna side with the Rubio Hegseth pro-Israel neo-cons? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=499.68s)]
*  Or is he gonna side with the domino portion of MAGA? Now both are in the building and that is [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  fascinating. Well, let me give you some more details about what's going on right now with [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=516.32s)]
*  the Pentagon under Donald Trump. Because to me, it's become clear that the wing of the MAGA movement [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  that wants to purge neo-cons is now starting to be pretty influential. I don't know how many of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  these people are in Donald Trump's ear, but I just wanna give you a quick spoiler. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=534.48s)]
*  Domeno is not the only person within this new administration that wants to pursue diplomacy and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=539.52s)]
*  does not wanna go to war with Iran. In fact, regarding the threat that Iran poses to the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=546.4s)]
*  United States, yeah, he poured cold water on that as well. And he did so during a radio interview [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=551.92s)]
*  last February. This was a radio interview with The Shoot with Peter Boyles. Let's take a look [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=558.56s)]
*  at what Domeno had to say. The people that try to tell you that Iran is somehow gonna take over [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=564.72s)]
*  the Middle East or something. I think it's fear mongering and I think it's it's problem and it's [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=571.2s)]
*  not supported by the facts. What's going on in the Middle East right now is a classic example of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=575.36s)]
*  what we call horizontal escalation, where you start to see the conflict spread to Lebanon, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=580.08s)]
*  to Iraq, to Yemen, right, with the Houthis. And none of this is good for the United States. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=585.84s)]
*  And I think that the Biden administration has really failed in putting its foot down and saying, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=590.64s)]
*  look, this has to deescalate and we have to bring about a succession of hostilities here [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=596.0s)]
*  in the region. And look, the United States in past Arab-Israeli conflicts has stayed out of it and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=604.88s)]
*  has pursued deescalation. And I think that that's really the most responsible thing to do here. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=610.72s)]
*  I loved everything he said there. In November of 2023, he put out a policy paper and said that it [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=615.92s)]
*  was in the United States' interest to use diplomacy to end the war in Gaza, ASAP. He also said that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  wiping out Hamas would only lead to the rise of Hamas 2.0. Now, obviously, the pro-Israel lobby [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=634.24s)]
*  and its allies are absolutely freaking out about this individual being chosen or selected [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=641.68s)]
*  by Donald Trump to serve in the Pentagon. Jewish Insider highlights the fact that Domino, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=646.0s)]
*  after Iran's second ballistic missile attack on Israel last year, dismissed the attack as a fairly [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=651.3599999999999s)]
*  moderate response to Israeli operations against Tehran and its terrorist proxy groups and suggested [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=658.16s)]
*  that Iran was holding back. Guess what? Iran was holding back. Iran wanted to give the impression [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=664.88s)]
*  to their people that they fought back against Israel after Israel had done airstrikes in Iran. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=671.12s)]
*  But they didn't want to kill anybody or hurt anybody because they knew the second someone [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=679.36s)]
*  in Israel gets hurt as a result of their retaliation, well, then all hell will break [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=683.36s)]
*  loose with the United States backing Israel in going to war in Iran. I'm really happy that [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=688.16s)]
*  that didn't happen. I'm happy that Iran didn't respond in a way that got anyone killed. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=693.6s)]
*  And look, I'm gonna keep it real. It feels good to hear someone who's going to be in the Pentagon [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=700.4s)]
*  saying these things. I mean, it's obvious, it's true, but it's so rare to hear this from someone [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=707.36s)]
*  who has a modicum of power in the federal government. He has vocally opposed attacking [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=712.8s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program, suggesting that an Israeli attack could lead Iran to release its restraint. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=719.04s)]
*  And elsewhere praised former President Joe Biden for pressuring Israel not to attack [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=725.36s)]
*  such sites back in April of 2024. And guess what? He's even on the record criticizing some [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=730.08s)]
*  of the so-called accomplishments of the first Trump term, even though he served in the first Trump term. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  So what was he critical about? Namely the Abraham Accords. He said, and I'm quoting him, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=743.6s)]
*  the Abraham Accords left out the issue of Israel-Palestine. And I think that's a massive [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=749.36s)]
*  mistake. That was largely done because people thought that that's the thorniest issue, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=754.8s)]
*  that we could set it aside and solve 80% of the rest of the equation. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=760.8s)]
*  But it doesn't work that way. This conflict is so central to the region. And you can't really [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=765.68s)]
*  address any kind of long-term political arrangements in the Gulf or in the Middle East [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=771.5999999999999s)]
*  without also addressing it. Could not agree more, perfectly stated. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=777.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'll go further. So number one, this is an unmitigated win for anyone who cares about the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=782.48s)]
*  peace movement. So it doesn't mean that he's going to win the overall fight within the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=790.64s)]
*  administration. But the very fact that he's in there and has these opinions and he's going, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=795.44s)]
*  and he's in charge of the Middle East for the Pentagon, that's unbelievable. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=800.0s)]
*  And I almost don't wanna talk about it too much for fear of riling up with the establishment and [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=804.08s)]
*  all the neocons and having all of Israel's supporters go and attack them, etc. But when [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=809.36s)]
*  he says it's so central, the occupation to solving the actual issues in the Middle East, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=815.44s)]
*  that is, again, an overwhelmingly obvious truth that absolutely no one in Washington will say [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=822.16s)]
*  that is in power. They'll say, yeah, the occupation. They largely ignore it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=830.0s)]
*  But if they don't ignore it, it's a small thing. No, it's not the small thing. It's the major [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=834.56s)]
*  cancer that causes everything else. And the reason why they ignore it and minimize it is because [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=840.88s)]
*  Israel wants to keep occupying the Palestinians. They've done it for 57 years now. Why do they [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=847.4399999999999s)]
*  wanna keep occupying them? Because every year they take more land in the West Bank, more land and [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=853.92s)]
*  more land and more land. And now that might also happen in Gaza. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=858.72s)]
*  So the fact that he's actually calling out the actual issue bravely, that's amazing. I've been [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=863.36s)]
*  waiting a lifetime for this. And I'll go further in saying that would Biden have appointed this guy? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=869.84s)]
*  I've got it at a 0% chance. Would Kamala Harris have appointed this guy? I have it at 0% chance. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=876.8000000000001s)]
*  And I don't mean this particular guy. I mean, a person that is a Democrat or on the left [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=884.88s)]
*  with the same exact issues. You could find hundreds of people on the left with the same [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=889.12s)]
*  policy issues. But there's no way in the world Kamala Harris would have appointed someone like [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=895.6s)]
*  that. Now, here's some more information about what Trump has done with the Pentagon. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=899.84s)]
*  So he actually got rid of the Iran hawk known as Brian Hook on the same day that he tapped [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=908.96s)]
*  Domeno to serve in the role that he will now serve in. Hook was a hawkish advisor who basically [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=916.0s)]
*  backed a maximum pressure sanctions regime that Trump instituted against Iran in his first term. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=922.32s)]
*  And so Trump got rid of him and on the same day selected Domeno to serve in the Pentagon. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=930.08s)]
*  And it's unclear exactly why Trump axed Hook. But the president says he and three others are [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=937.36s)]
*  not aligned with our vision to make America great again. That's kind of incredible. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=945.6s)]
*  And the amazing thing is that before Hook was fired, he was actually working on Trump's [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=953.36s)]
*  transition team for the State Department. Now he's gone. And Cenk, you're gonna really [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=958.24s)]
*  appreciate this. Mark Levin is super salty about what's been going on. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=963.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=969.0400000000001s)]
*  He reacted to the Domeno pick with this. Take a look. How'd this creep get a top [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=969.6s)]
*  Department of Defense position? I'm here for it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=977.52s)]
*  I don't know, but I jump in it. I love it. There's also a lot of rage over [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=980.72s)]
*  Trump promoting his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to be the man in charge of diplomacy [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=985.9200000000001s)]
*  with Iran. Witkoff was the real estate guy who actually helped secure the ceasefire deal between [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=992.72s)]
*  Israel and Hamas. Sager and Jette kind of alerted me to this, not personally, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=999.44s)]
*  but he posted about it on X saying, alert, I am hearing of a massive whisper campaign in DC [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1006.48s)]
*  against Steve Witkoff for negotiating the ceasefire and other Trump appointees [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1011.9200000000001s)]
*  who want to avoid war with Iran. And I just wanna give you one example that I came across [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1017.12s)]
*  on X, and that's a conservative pro-Israel reporter and commentator who basically posted [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1023.2s)]
*  about Witkoff complaining about him, complaining that he's willing to reach understandings about [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1030.8s)]
*  everything with Hamas, admits that he and Trump team didn't even try to get any additional hostages [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1035.68s)]
*  out, fawns over Qatari leadership again. Remember, Qatari leadership was fundamental [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1041.12s)]
*  in helping to broker the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1047.36s)]
*  And look, Israel supporters, those who want Israel to do whatever it wants with no repercussions, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1051.36s)]
*  they don't like the ceasefire deal because they don't think it goes far enough in [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1061.04s)]
*  favor of what Israel's interests are, which is crazy. But I love that they secure the [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1065.6s)]
*  ceasefire deal. Obviously, it's a very fragile ceasefire. Hopefully, it gets past that first [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1071.36s)]
*  six-week phase and we can look forward to lasting peace in the region. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1077.84s)]
*  Obviously, that's a difficult thing to bet any money on. But nonetheless, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1083.12s)]
*  so far, there are some really interesting developments in the Trump administration. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1088.08s)]
*  Yeah, I wanna go to you guys and give you a voice for a second in nature. So we did a poll on this [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1093.1200000000001s)]
*  one. This is a good hire by Trump. I'm actually, to be honest, really surprised that it's 64, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1098.0s)]
*  36, 64 saying yes, 36% saying no. I mean, I suppose if you say like, no, I would really love [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1103.0400000000002s)]
*  America to start a war on behalf of Israel, you would say, no, I don't want this guy. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1110.0s)]
*  I love the neo-cons, I guess you would say, no, I don't want this guy. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1116.16s)]
*  But I suspected a lot of people who said no said no because as a Trump appointee. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1120.32s)]
*  But then you're agreeing with Mark Levin, who is one of the worst right-wing media hosts in the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1125.6s)]
*  world. He's way more right-wing than Trump. He's way more in favor of wars than Trump is. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1130.96s)]
*  Why? Okay, I don't get it. I literally, literally don't get why anyone would be opposed to this guy [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1142.32s)]
*  unless they think, no, America should serve Israel. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1149.12s)]
*  So look, again, I'm not trying to criticize you. It's an interesting poll. And maybe you guys could [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1153.04s)]
*  write in and tell me why you voted that way. But a couple of members here, Dragon with a Girl tattoo [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1157.52s)]
*  said the Trump administration is bipolar. And guys, that's exactly what we've been trying to tell you. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1163.12s)]
*  This group of Republicans is a little bit different than old group of Republicans. Before [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1168.9599999999998s)]
*  when I ever talked to a Republican, talking point, talking point, talking point, right-wing, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1174.3999999999999s)]
*  right-wing, right-wing, every position is super predictable. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1177.68s)]
*  When you go talk to MAGO right-wing hosts now, one way of framing it is they look bipolar. Why? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1180.88s)]
*  Because they have internal disagreement and they allow for internal disagreement. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1188.5600000000002s)]
*  So there's right-wing hosts that are screaming at each other, some pro-Israel, some saying, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1194.48s)]
*  let's get the hell out of the Middle East and I don't know why we're funding Israel. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1200.16s)]
*  And that dynamic of that base being split is now showing up in the Trump administration. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1204.32s)]
*  And he's appointing people on both sides. That is a really interesting development. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1210.48s)]
*  And last thing is, this is a little bit critical and that's why I wanna address it. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1215.76s)]
*  Cenk's left tricep of fury, great member of ours at tyt.com said, the only reason he's bad-mouthing [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1219.6799999999998s)]
*  Bolton is because Bolton dissed him continuously after leaving his cabinet. Trump still has no [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1224.72s)]
*  problem with war hawks like Lindsey Graham, etc., just as long as they kiss his ass. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1229.2s)]
*  I would say two things can be true at the same time. You're right, he mainly hates Bolton because [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  Bolton bad-mouthed them, Lindsey Graham kisses his ass, he says he's fine. But while that's true, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vU8ltnEVY&t=1238.56s)]
