Rubio made the startling comments in Paris after attending a meeting between officials from the U.S., Ukraine, and Europe seeking an outline of steps to end the three-year-old war."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Trump Prepares To BAIL On Ukraine
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0)
*  But I want to stop the war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't want that war to continue. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=1.96s)]
*  And I'll stop that war, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=3.6s)]
*  mark my words, I'll stop that war [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=5.08s)]
*  in 24 hours. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=7.44s)]
*  We need to figure out here now with [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=8.48s)]
*  a matter of days whether this is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=10.72s)]
*  doable in the short term. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=12.72s)]
*  Because if it's not, then I think [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  we're just going to move on from [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=16.52s)]
*  our perspective. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=17.88s)]
*  The president feels very strongly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=18.64s)]
*  about that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=20.16s)]
*  Those two guys should probably [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=21.04s)]
*  talk. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Of course, that was Donald Trump [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  back in 2023, back when he was in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=24.8s)]
*  the mode of claiming that he would [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=26.16s)]
*  accomplish everything in 24 hours, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=27.64s)]
*  including ending the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=29.4s)]
*  He told us to mark his words, and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=31.36s)]
*  we have, and it doesn't matter [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  because the buck stops anywhere [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=35.6s)]
*  other than with Donald Trump. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=37.6s)]
*  He probably doesn't even remember [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=39.36s)]
*  the conflict is even happening. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=40.64s)]
*  But he's also, over the past couple [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=42.08s)]
*  of months, been implying that he's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=44.2s)]
*  going to force Ukraine to accept [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=46.28s)]
*  some sort of deal on the terms of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=48.16s)]
*  Russia, and that sounded bad enough. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=50.2s)]
*  Now, according to Marco Rubio, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  there might not be anything. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=55.2s)]
*  He might just wash his hands of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=56.96s)]
*  the entire thing and let Russia do [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=58.48s)]
*  literally 100% of whatever they [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=60.32s)]
*  want, which, Cenk, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=62.279999999999994s)]
*  maybe not the biggest surprise. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=63.68s)]
*  But this is just another area where [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=66.92s)]
*  Trump might be preemptively either [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=68.64s)]
*  giving up or letting someone else [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=70.28s)]
*  control what happens. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=71.8s)]
*  Part of the deal? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=73.44s)]
*  No, kidding. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=74.72s)]
*  No, so a bit of a disaster here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=75.32s)]
*  The main question I have, and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=79.4s)]
*  we'll see if we can answer it in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=81.19999999999999s)]
*  giving you the details of the story [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=83.24s)]
*  is, yes, but what happens [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=85.72s)]
*  when we just let it go? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=88.68s)]
*  Does that mean we let the Ukrainians [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  go and let the Russians just do [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=92.92s)]
*  whatever they want to them? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Does that mean we keep funding [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=96.0s)]
*  them at the same rate that we're [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=97.28s)]
*  funding them? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=98.56s)]
*  What in the world does he mean? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=99.44s)]
*  Let's try to figure it out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=102.08s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it's pretty much what [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=103.48s)]
*  you said. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=104.92s)]
*  I think it's letting whatever [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=105.44s)]
*  Russia wants happen happen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=106.84s)]
*  That's my fear, but that said, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=108.16s)]
*  let's hear more from Marco Rubio and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=109.44s)]
*  see what he has to say about it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=110.92s)]
*  I think it's important to remind [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=112.76s)]
*  everybody that the Ukraine war is [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=114.16s)]
*  a terrible thing, but [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=115.64s)]
*  it's not our war. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  We didn't start it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=117.64s)]
*  The United States has been helping [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine for over the last three [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  years, and we want it to end. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=121.44s)]
*  But it's not our war. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=123.8s)]
*  I want everyone to understand that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=124.8s)]
*  And the reason why I make that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  point is the president has spent [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=127.28s)]
*  87 days at the highest level of his [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=128.84s)]
*  government repeatedly taking [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=130.64s)]
*  efforts to bring this war to an end. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=132.32s)]
*  We are now reaching a point where [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=134.92s)]
*  we need to decide and determine [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=136.72s)]
*  whether this is even possible or [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=138.44s)]
*  not. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=140.16s)]
*  I can tell you this, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=140.66s)]
*  this war has no military solution [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=141.68s)]
*  to it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=143.48s)]
*  It really doesn't. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=144.16s)]
*  It's not going to be decided with [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  neither side has some strategic [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=146.6s)]
*  capability to end this war quickly. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=148.24s)]
*  And so what we're talking about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=150.48s)]
*  here is avoiding thousands and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=151.84s)]
*  thousands of people from dying over [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=153.08s)]
*  the next year. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  We're trying to avoid that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=155.96s)]
*  We saw what happened last weekend [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=156.8s)]
*  with a missile strike in Sumi where [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=158.16s)]
*  people died on Palm Sunday. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=159.68s)]
*  We're just going to see more like [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=161.72s)]
*  that on both sides. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=162.72s)]
*  We're going to see more of that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=163.72s)]
*  We're trying to prevent it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=164.52s)]
*  But we're not going to continue to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=165.76s)]
*  fly all over the world and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=167.2s)]
*  do meeting after meeting after [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=168.24s)]
*  meeting if no progress is being [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=169.88s)]
*  made. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=171.52s)]
*  So if they're serious about peace, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=172.24s)]
*  either side or both, we want to help. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  If it's not going to happen, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=175.92s)]
*  then we're just going to move on. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  I was actually prepared in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  this segment to be pretty critical [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=180.92s)]
*  of the Secretary of State [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=182.44s)]
*  effectively washing his hands of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=183.48s)]
*  this conflict. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  I didn't know that he had to fly [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=185.44s)]
*  places and take meetings. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=188.0s)]
*  That does sound very exhausting. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=189.92s)]
*  People talk so much about the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=192.72s)]

*  up as you're going to see in a [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=245.44s)]
*  second. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=246.52s)]
*  So look, first, I guess a lot of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  the right wing thinks that they've [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=249.72s)]

*  human being. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=254.84s)]
*  But I wish we hadn't accepted that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=256.16s)]
*  in our president. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=258.04s)]
*  And here's what I mean by that, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=259.2s)]
*  that he was going to solve it in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=260.88s)]
*  24 hours. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=262.36s)]
*  Did anyone really believe that? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=263.72s)]
*  Ed, are you now, are you super [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  frustrated with Trump that he [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=270.6s)]
*  didn't solve it magically in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=272.68s)]
*  24 hours? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=274.76s)]
*  Or have you moved to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=276.24s)]
*  GoPost along with him and said, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  no, we didn't mean 24 hours. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=278.68s)]
*  And we didn't mean three months, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=280.92s)]
*  we meant maybe never. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=282.68s)]
*  And so that's moving a lot of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=284.12s)]
*  gold on the Post Brothers, okay? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=286.76s)]
*  So now his second question is, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  if you think, well, no, look, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=291.88s)]
*  I know the president is absurd and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=293.88s)]
*  he says ridiculous things to get [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=295.76s)]
*  attention. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  And I've made my peace with it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  And as long as he makes peace in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=300.36s)]
*  this particular conflict, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't care that he's grandiose [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  and at times buffoonish. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  I wish we hadn't made peace with [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=310.44s)]
*  that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=311.88s)]
*  And when it comes to being the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=312.4s)]
*  President of the United States, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=313.68s)]
*  which we had a serious person who [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=315.2s)]
*  actually meant what he said instead [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  of making up ridiculous things. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=318.44s)]
*  Now, to the heart of the issue, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=320.2s)]
*  if all this somehow magically gets [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=322.96s)]
*  them to a peace deal, then great. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=324.96s)]
*  I don't really care about the ups [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=326.88s)]
*  and downs of negotiations, etc. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=328.88s)]
*  But does it look like we're close [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=332.16s)]
*  to a peace deal? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=333.56s)]
*  Because it doesn't look like it to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=334.12s)]
*  me. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=335.32s)]
*  And so now they're at the point [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=335.84s)]
*  where they're almost throwing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=337.08s)]
*  their hands up, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=338.36s)]
*  So remember, one of the issues [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=339.72s)]
*  here was that everything was [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=343.92s)]
*  going along well, I don't know, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=347.36s)]
*  they were at least doing [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=350.0s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=351.28s)]
*  But then Trump and the US demanded [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=352.44s)]
*  mineral rights in Ukraine. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=354.88s)]
*  That is much, much worse, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=357.24s)]
*  it's give up on, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=358.76s)]
*  it's an epic disaster. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=359.72s)]
*  What's been incredibly unclear [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=361.16s)]
*  the whole time, I mean, first, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=363.64s)]
*  Cenk makes a great point that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=366.04s)]
*  the President boasted that within [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=368.2s)]
*  24 hours he could end this [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=370.52s)]
*  conflict. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=372.32s)]
*  I think he assumed that since he's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=373.0s)]
*  so chummy with Putin, that he [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=374.92s)]
*  would actually be able to get [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=376.6s)]
*  Putin and negotiate some sort of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  deal that was good for Putin and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=380.64s)]
*  maybe forced to be accepted by [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=383.08s)]
*  the Ukrainians and all the rest of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=385.44s)]
*  us. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=388.04s)]
*  But clearly, we see that the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=388.56s)]
*  President does not have nearly the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  power, deal making power, or [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=393.72s)]
*  even the political power, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=396.04s)]
*  the claims to have after all of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=398.08s)]
*  these theatrics and all of this sort [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=400.2s)]
*  of nauseating set of stories where [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=403.04s)]
*  he is essentially repeated [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=405.84s)]
*  systematically Russian state [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=407.64s)]
*  talking points. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=409.76s)]
*  And I obviously publicly embarrassed [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=410.88s)]
*  Zelensky to try to push him into [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=413.36s)]
*  a leverage position where he would [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=415.32s)]
*  agree to the mineral deal. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=417.44s)]
*  What is under discussed as usual [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=419.28s)]
*  when it comes to this President is [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=421.88s)]
*  what exactly does he want and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  what is the outcome he is pushing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=426.68s)]
*  for? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  And for Marco Rubio to basically [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=429.56s)]
*  say there's no meaning to it, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=431.52s)]
*  he's just saying, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=433.28s)]
*  to basically say there's no [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=434.52000000000004s)]
*  military solution, but essentially [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=436.36s)]
*  say that the US is not able to do [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=439.20000000000005s)]
*  what it said it could do in 24 [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=441.5s)]
*  hours and broker an actual peace [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=443.62s)]
*  agreement is very telling. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=445.88s)]
*  It speaks to the weakness of this [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=447.72s)]
*  administration, the weakness of its [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  political leverage and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  the absence of a political vision. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=453.76s)]
*  And one last point, note everybody [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=456.12s)]
*  that there were a couple ceasefires [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=458.68s)]

*  foolish, you're fools, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=547.7600000000001s)]
*  you're horrible people. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=549.24s)]
*  We're going to just take a pass, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=550.88s)]
*  but hopefully we won't have to do [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=552.6s)]
*  that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so importantly, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=555.6s)]
*  there are two parts to that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=556.4s)]
*  So one is how many days, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=557.2s)]
*  no specific number because he has [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=558.8s)]
*  no idea. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=561.12s)]
*  He has no idea with this as he does [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=562.0s)]
*  with anything else. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=563.92s)]
*  Don't ask him for specifics on what [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=565.12s)]
*  his administration is going to do. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=567.0s)]
*  He's clearly not in charge in many [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=568.96s)]
*  of these topics. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=570.96s)]
*  The other area though, is way [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=571.96s)]
*  clearer. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=573.84s)]
*  He says if one of the side is being [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=574.96s)]
*  really irresponsible, we're going to [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=576.88s)]
*  say that they're terrible, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  horrible people. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=580.64s)]
*  I wonder which side he's talking [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=581.88s)]
*  about. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=583.52s)]
*  I wonder, probably both. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=584.04s)]
*  I think he's probably willing to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=586.28s)]
*  call Putin horrible too, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=588.04s)]
*  not just Zelensky and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  the Ukrainians. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=590.28s)]
*  No, that's obviously ridiculous. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  And look, that's supposed to be [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=592.36s)]
*  playing hardball. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=593.8s)]
*  But again, if you're Zelensky just [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=594.52s)]
*  constantly being punched in [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=596.48s)]

*  demanded, his pound of flesh. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  And he's continually insulting you, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  your administration, and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=616.8000000000001s)]

*  this meeting yesterday, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  one of the arduous meetings that's [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=623.0s)]
*  so exhausting, Marco Rubio. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=625.0400000000001s)]
*  People from officials from Ukraine, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=627.44s)]
*  Europe, and the US all met in [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  Paris. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=631.2s)]
*  And at the meeting, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=632.1600000000001s)]
*  US officials proposed a ceasefire [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  plan. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=634.5200000000001s)]
*  And here are some of the issues [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=635.2s)]
*  with it according to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=636.72s)]
*  European officials. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=637.84s)]
*  The proposal would effectively [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=639.28s)]
*  freeze the war with Ukrainian [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=641.12s)]
*  territories now occupied by Russia [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=642.84s)]
*  remaining under Moscow's control. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=644.8s)]
*  Kiev's aspirations of joining NATO [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=646.96s)]
*  would also be off the table. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=649.24s)]
*  And on top of that, Russia, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=650.8s)]
*  not giving up literally anything, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=652.72s)]
*  not a foot of territory, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  would also, so now they never have [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=657.0s)]
*  to worry about Ukraine entering [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=659.16s)]
*  NATO, okay? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=661.08s)]
*  So Ukraine will be no better [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=661.96s)]
*  prepared for a follow on invasion [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=663.24s)]
*  a year or two years from now. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=665.0s)]
*  After this, and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=666.6s)]
*  Russia gets relief from [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=667.6s)]
*  economic sanctions. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=669.2s)]
*  They get everything, I guess, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=672.32s)]
*  other than the entirety of Ukraine [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=674.36s)]
*  offered up on a silver platter. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=676.64s)]
*  But even that, they're only not [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=678.88s)]
*  getting that immediately. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=680.48s)]
*  They're definitely getting that in [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=681.6s)]
*  a few years. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=683.64s)]
*  All of this utter madness, and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=685.12s)]
*  Russia says, even in response to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=686.64s)]
*  all this, the root causes of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=688.32s)]
*  the war have to be addressed before [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  committing to a ceasefire. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=691.72s)]
*  The root cause of the war, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  to be clear, was Vladimir Putin [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=694.4s)]
*  invading the goddamn country. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=696.0s)]
*  That's the root cause of the war. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=697.72s)]
*  I know the nonsense they would [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=699.24s)]
*  spin that like, Ukraine is talking [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=700.56s)]
*  about joining a defensive alliance [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=702.14s)]
*  or something. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=703.8s)]
*  I just want you to think about how [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=704.76s)]
*  utterly insane that is. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=706.32s)]
*  Let's say I hear tell that one of [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=707.68s)]
*  my neighbors is talking with [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=709.56s)]

*  And they're setting up some sort of [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=712.64s)]
*  deal where if I rob one of their [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=714.36s)]
*  houses, they'll both shoot me. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=716.0s)]
*  And my response is, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=717.72s)]
*  I robbed his house that night. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=719.0s)]
*  I don't seem like the good guy in [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=721.4s)]
*  that story, do I? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=722.8s)]
*  It seems like inevitably I was [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=723.84s)]
*  going to rob the house. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=725.72s)]
*  I just wanted to do it under [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=727.0s)]
*  the right circumstances. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=728.28s)]
*  And that is exactly what is going [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=729.4s)]
*  on with Russia. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=731.36s)]
*  They were preparing to at some [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=733.16s)]
*  point invade and conquer Ukraine [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=734.68s)]
*  and likely other former Soviet [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=736.4s)]
*  republics. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=738.04s)]
*  And they didn't like the idea that [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=739.24s)]
*  Ukraine entering NATO would stop [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=741.0s)]
*  them from doing that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=742.72s)]
*  There is no reason that Ukraine [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=744.16s)]
*  being a member of NATO would [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=745.64s)]
*  bother a country that had no [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=746.96s)]
*  interest in actually invading it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=748.36s)]
*  It just doesn't make any logical [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=750.04s)]
*  sense. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=751.64s)]
*  Ramesh, any thoughts about Donald [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=752.72s)]
*  Trump or any of the other stuff I [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=754.5200000000001s)]
*  said? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=755.8800000000001s)]
*  Well, Russia has already showed [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=756.4000000000001s)]
*  long before this latest set of [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=758.4000000000001s)]
*  the last few years that it would [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=760.24s)]
*  invade Crimea. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=762.24s)]
*  And it's interesting how our [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=763.9200000000001s)]
*  current administration is sort of [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=766.2s)]
*  playing up isolationism in certain [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=769.1600000000001s)]
*  ways without recognizing our own [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=772.12s)]
*  kind of complicity in militarizing [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=774.72s)]
*  the world. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=777.36s)]
*  And I think a big part of that is [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=778.44s)]
*  the worship, as Cenk was alluding [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=780.6400000000001s)]
*  to earlier of the gilded age that [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=783.12s)]
*  this administration has. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  We can stay isolated, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=786.6800000000001s)]
*  we're just going to be about [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=787.64s)]
*  ourselves. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=788.88s)]
*  But whenever we can do land grabs [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=789.44s)]
*  or resource grabs, let's do it, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=791.24s)]
*  which is an old school colonial [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=793.12s)]
*  imperialist kind of approach. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=794.96s)]
*  That said, I do think we have, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=797.72s)]
*  this is not any justification for [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=799.8000000000001s)]
*  any of Russia's actions who started [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=802.08s)]
*  the war, clearly. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=804.5200000000001s)]
*  But the US has not been an honest [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=805.9200000000001s)]
*  partner with its decisions it's [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=808.2800000000001s)]
*  stated, and it's not a clear [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=810.72s)]
*  statement that it stated after the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=813.32s)]
*  fall of the Berlin Wall that NATO [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  would not expand east of Berlin. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=818.08s)]
*  That said, there's clearly a reason [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=821.24s)]
*  why all of these nations that are [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=824.12s)]
*  generally peaceful want to join [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=826.76s)]
*  NATO. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=829.36s)]
*  So what is very sad to me is that [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=831.1600000000001s)]
*  the US did not show any leadership [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=833.36s)]
*  since the fall of the Soviet Union [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=835.84s)]
*  and the fall of the Berlin Wall [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=838.24s)]
*  that brokered an actual real kind [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=840.6s)]
*  of peace agreement that we could be [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=842.96s)]
*  observing to this day. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=845.32s)]
*  Propped up people like Yeltsin, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=847.84s)]
*  who then basically whose pathetic [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=850.0s)]
*  regime led to the rise of Putin and [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=852.08s)]
*  the oligarchs and the deal he cut [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=854.12s)]
*  with the oligarchs. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=856.12s)]
*  And some of that is uncannily like [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=858.32s)]
*  what we're looking at right now in [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=859.72s)]
*  this country. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=861.12s)]
*  So it's very sad. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=861.9200000000001s)]
*  US didn't show any leadership then [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  and it's not showing any leadership [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=864.64s)]
*  now and that basically is going to [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=866.44s)]
*  give Russia carte blanche to be as [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=868.1600000000001s)]
*  aggressive and militaristic as it [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=869.92s)]
*  wants and it certainly it is not [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=871.7199999999999s)]
*  without question that Putin would [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  want to expand and get back to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=875.24s)]
*  something approximating [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=876.76s)]
*  the Russian Empire. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=878.16s)]
*  But the key for me is de escalation [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=879.28s)]
*  rather than escalation. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=881.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, 100% and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=883.12s)]
*  I while all this is ongoing, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=884.7199999999999s)]
*  I feel terrible for [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=886.36s)]
*  the people of Ukraine who have been [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=887.4s)]
*  through unimaginable situations for [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=889.28s)]
*  literally years now. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=891.36s)]
*  Effectively being told by what's [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=892.4799999999999s)]
*  supposed to be sort of like one of [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=894.56s)]
*  the moral forces for safety, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=896.56s)]
*  security, peace, all of that. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=898.4399999999999s)]
*  Telling them either give up your [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=900.84s)]
*  country now, or we're not going to [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=902.68s)]
*  help you get any deal and then it'll [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=904.76s)]
*  be taken from you over the next [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=906.76s)]
*  year or two. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=908.56s)]
*  But a horrid abdication of our [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=909.72s)]
*  place in the world. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=912.48s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=914.0s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=915.6s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=916.64s)]
*  our live shows. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_Ax2qkOe0&t=917.88s)]
