# He Made Trump CRASH Out
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q)
*  I'm not happy with what Putin's doing. He's killing a lot of people and I don't know what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  the hell happened to Putin. I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  But he's sending rockets into cities and killing people and I don't like it at all, okay? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=9.36s)]
*  We're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=15.68s)]
*  I don't like it at all. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=19.92s)]
*  President Donald Trump was today years old when he realized that Russia bad, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=20.96s)]
*  that Putin is carrying out a brutal war against the Ukrainian people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=27.84s)]
*  And now he appears to be losing patience with Vladimir Putin as Russia escalates its assault [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=33.28s)]
*  on Ukraine. Now Trump has been trying to get the two sides to agree to a peace deal and stop the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  fighting. But it looks like Zelensky might have been correct in pointing out that Putin is the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  one that's serving as an obstacle to a peace deal. Now regardless of what Trump wants, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=50.08s)]
*  Russia launched its largest ever missile and drone strike on Ukraine over the Memorial Day weekend. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=54.64s)]
*  So from Friday through Sunday, Russia launched around 900 drone strikes, 900. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=62.64s)]
*  Now on Sunday, Trump wrote the following on Truth Social. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=70.72s)]
*  I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=74.16s)]
*  happened to him. He has gone absolutely crazy. He is needlessly killing a lot of people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=78.56s)]
*  And I'm not just talking about soldiers. Missiles and drones are being shot into cities in Ukraine [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=85.36s)]
*  for no reason whatsoever. I've always said that he wants all of Ukraine, not just a piece of it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=91.44s)]
*  And maybe that's proving to be right. But if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=97.92s)]
*  So I just wanna be clear that Trump just said, I was going around telling people this lie [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=103.92s)]
*  that Russia wants to take over the entirety of Ukraine. And you know what? It might actually be [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=111.92s)]
*  true. Okay, yes, it does appear that Russia wants to take over more territory in Ukraine. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=116.48s)]
*  And because of the fact that they've been successful so far, they don't feel, or Putin [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=124.16s)]
*  specifically doesn't feel that he needs to stop. And look, I think that Donald Trump totally [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=129.68s)]
*  underestimated Vladimir Putin and what his real goals are here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=135.52s)]
*  But I also wanna just go back to the Biden administration and how Boris Johnson, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=141.28s)]
*  during the Biden administration, and of course at that time Boris Johnson was the leader of the UK, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=148.16s)]
*  met with Zelensky and discouraged him from negotiating for a peace deal with Russia. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=152.88s)]
*  And I think that was probably the best opportunity to sign a peace agreement, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=158.32s)]
*  and that opportunity was squandered. And I feel terrible for the Ukrainian people. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=162.32s)]
*  I don't think Trump is gonna be successful in encouraging Putin to engage in real [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=166.16s)]
*  peace negotiations, but I'm curious what you think, Cenk. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=171.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think this story goes in both directions. But first, wait till he finds out about Gaza. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=173.92s)]
*  Did you know Israel leveled every hospital and every school and 90% of the buildings in Gaza? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=179.68s)]
*  And Mike, did you know that they killed 28,000 women and children? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=186.88s)]
*  That'll be a fun moment when he finds that out for the first time, apparently. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  Speaking of which, by the way, just a quick side note here. What Russia has done in Ukraine is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=196.32s)]
*  despicable, and they've killed over 13,000 civilians. We, of course, are funding Ukraine [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=201.76s)]
*  to fight back against those atrocities. Israel has killed 16,000 children alone in Gaza, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=208.48s)]
*  and we are, of course, funding those atrocities. So there's a giant difference there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  Okay, now on to Russia. So the reason why I say it goes both directions is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=222.0s)]
*  Trump is often like a child. It's amazing. You just realized Vladimir Putin bad. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=227.12s)]
*  And by the way, he's not alone. This is whatever US president realizes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  And I don't know why they're so weirdly naive, including Obama, who wanted to reset relationships [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=237.6s)]
*  with Putin. Okay, reset, at least I get it. You're trying to get it back diplomacy on the right [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=242.48s)]
*  direction. George W. Bush called him pootie poot and said that he looked into his eyes and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=247.68s)]
*  saw his soul and realized that he was a good man. Why do they keep assuming this former KGB officer [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=254.16s)]
*  that has now attacked three different times into sovereign countries and pushes reporters [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=262.32s)]
*  out of windows? I'm sorry, they trip out of their own window onto the street [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=269.36s)]
*  over and over and over again that he's somehow a good guy. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=274.64s)]
*  Like any shocks them when they find out he's a bad guy. No, Vladimir Putin, definitely, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=279.12s)]
*  definitely a bad guy. That doesn't- [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=285.36s)]
*  Cenk. Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=288.24s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt you, but all three presidents that you just listed [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=289.44s)]
*  went to Ivy Leagues. Maybe we should defund the Ivy Leagues. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm just kidding. Go ahead. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, so did I, but I'm not an idiot and I'm not naive like those guys. So that doesn't mean that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=300.48s)]
*  we did the right thing by pushing NATO to Russia's boundaries. But if you think that, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  golly gee, Vladimir Putin has now invaded a third time into a sovereign country and taken more land [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=312.88s)]
*  from those countries. I guess he was forced into it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=320.32s)]
*  No, you're not forced into imperial empire type of attacks against your neighbors. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=324.0s)]
*  He's doing it on purpose, this is obvious. But so where in the world is any kind of silver lining [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=331.68s)]
*  this story? Well, look, I didn't think that Trump and Russia worked together in the 2016 election. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=336.72s)]
*  But I did think that Trump and Putin and Russia had some sort of financial connection. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  And his son said over and over again, the Russians love golf. That's why they give us all of them, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=351.36s)]
*  all of our money for golf courses, etc. They said all these things on the record that made [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  me think, well, obviously he's got a financial connection there. But maybe he doesn't. I mean, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=359.36s)]
*  it certainly looks like he doesn't now, right? And so maybe he was just hoping to get more money [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=364.16s)]
*  from the Russians because he'd made deals with the Russians before when he was a business man. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't know what was in his head. But this Donald Trump doesn't seem like he's beholden to Putin, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=374.8s)]
*  even though he's trying to lean in. He has been trying to lean in his direction, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=380.48s)]
*  but clearly not beholden. So we're fair and honest about that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  Look, I don't know if Trump has had business dealings with the Russian government specifically, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=389.12s)]
*  but I do know that Russian oligarchs have parked their money in Trump properties and have paid way, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=395.36s)]
*  way over market value for said properties. So that always raised a red flag for me. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=403.84s)]
*  But you do make a valid point here in that if there was any type of financial relationship [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=412.0s)]
*  between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, it's certainly not playing out or working to Trump's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=417.04s)]
*  benefit when it comes to geopolitics or his attempt at getting Putin to sign a peace deal. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=422.8s)]
*  But you know Trump. I mean, sure, he'll take a few jabs at Putin, but he can't do that without [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=428.88s)]
*  also taking some jabs at Zelensky, who by the way, was totally on board with signing a peace [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  agreement. He hasn't really been an obstacle during the Trump administration, at least, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=441.92s)]
*  in regard to signing a peace deal. But nonetheless, Trump did take some jabs [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=446.16s)]
*  at Zelensky saying, likewise, President Zelensky is doing his country no favors [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  by talking the way he does. Okay, how does he talk? Let's be specific here. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  Everything out of his mouth causes problems. I don't like it and it better stop. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=462.0s)]
*  This is a war that would have never started if I were president. Okay, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=467.04s)]
*  thanks for the specificity noted. Now Putin's spokesperson attributed that post to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  emotional overload. So basically, Putin's camp is accusing Trump of being emotional, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=476.16s)]
*  which I'm sure Trump loves. This morning Trump wrote the following on social media. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=482.32000000000005s)]
*  What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, lots of really bad things would [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  have already happened to Russia. And I mean really bad. He's playing with fire. Now, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=493.36s)]
*  while Russia and Ukraine did carry out a prisoner exchange recently, ceasefire talks have otherwise [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=499.6s)]
*  stalled. So Trump brokered a 30 day ceasefire plan, which was accepted by Zelensky, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=505.44s)]
*  but Russia did not accept it. Instead, Russia wanted to hold talks on disarming Ukraine and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=512.24s)]
*  making sure Ukraine never joins NATO. Now Trump is facing pressure to place economic [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=518.32s)]
*  sanctions on Putin. Yesterday, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley wrote the following. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=523.44s)]
*  And I'm gonna apologize on his behalf for the way he spelled enough. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=528.8s)]
*  You are a United States Senator, bro. But anyway, he wrote, I've had enough of Putin killing innocent [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=532.24s)]
*  people. Pres Trump, take action at least sanctions. And then you have Republican Senator Lindsey Graham [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=541.04s)]
*  writing up a bill that would put 500% tariffs on any country that buys energy products from Russia, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=548.8s)]
*  including oil, petroleum, natural gas, and uranium. The bill has the support of over 80 [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  United States Senators. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also been pushing the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=563.0400000000001s)]
*  US to impose sanctions on Putin. So we'll see if that happens. But today, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=567.36s)]
*  Lawrence Jones reported that Trump could be weighing more than just sanctions on Putin. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=570.72s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=576.08s)]
*  Based on my sources that I've talked to, the President is extremely angry with Putin right [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=576.96s)]
*  now because he tried to do this the right way, get Putin off ramp, give him a reset, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  try to hear him out on some of his concerns when it came down to NATO. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=590.32s)]
*  And Putin, as a such, has slapped his hand. And now he's going after the President publicly as [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=594.08s)]
*  well. So all I can report is that, yes, there may be sanctions, but there could be more as well. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=601.44s)]
*  Well, there are some US troops who are now positioned in European countries. The Wall [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=608.08s)]
*  Street Journal is reporting this. So this is to strengthen NATO ties and send a message to Russia. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=614.96s)]
*  The troops are currently, Marines specifically, are currently in Sweden, Norway, and Finland. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  The Marines were performing military exercises involving a rocket launcher, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=626.32s)]
*  which was filled with dummy munitions. Cenk? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=631.44s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of disturbing parts of the story. So what does he mean there could be more [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  than sanctions? That doesn't sound good. We should not take military action against Russia. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=640.32s)]
*  If he means, we'll fund Ukraine even more, okay. All right, well, that's a legitimate threat against [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  Russia in a way that doesn't break precedent, doesn't escalate the war, et cetera. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=654.64s)]
*  But it's a little bit concerning. And then, Dawn, okay, to your point real quick, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=662.48s)]
*  intermission here on Chuck Grassley, he's spelling enough like he's a teenager. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=667.6s)]
*  He's like 108 years old. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=673.04s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=675.12s)]
*  So I don't know if he does that all the time or if it's like his consultants told him, hey, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=677.12s)]
*  speak more like a populist, misspell words. And he's like, all right, I'll just misspell everything. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=682.16s)]
*  All right, it's so sad. Anyway, back to relevant stuff. And then Trump said, if it wasn't for me, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=688.48s)]
*  really bad things would have happened to Russia. Wait, what did you prevent? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=695.76s)]
*  Yeah, seriously. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=699.36s)]
*  What were we gonna do to Russia and why did you stop us? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  Right, and maybe it was a good reason, maybe it was a bad reason. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=706.0s)]
*  But that was also disconcerting. So this is a hot mess. And it's so weird because I thought [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=709.68s)]
*  Donald Trump was gonna solve all this on day one. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=715.68s)]
*  Yeah, turns out foreign policy hard. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=722.32s)]
*  Nobody knew it was this difficult. Nobody knew that Vladimir Putin actually [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=726.32s)]
*  wasn't trying to defend himself, but was actually aggressively attacking to [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=731.2s)]
*  conquer more territory. No one knew that. So Trump just figured it out. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=735.28s)]
*  Yeah, and look, I'll say this. I do think there is a place for approaching these types of conflicts [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=741.12s)]
*  with diplomacy before you start threatening war or before you start having US troops stationed [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=748.24s)]
*  near the country that's causing problems to do provocative military exercises. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=753.52s)]
*  However, it is pretty abundantly clear that Putin has no interest in engaging in good faith [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=758.48s)]
*  in any type of peace negotiations. And it's a damn shame because a lot of innocent people [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=764.4s)]
*  are dying. This war should come to an end. But Trump is quickly learning that his goodwill [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=769.6s)]
*  toward the Russian government is not really working out so well. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=776.24s)]
*  So we'll see how this plays out. But I agree with you, we should not go to war with Russia. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=780.16s)]
*  I don't know what comes next though. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJHBxgD9b0Q&t=784.0s)]
