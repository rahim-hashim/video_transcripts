# Trump Makes INSANE Claim About High Drug Prices. Dave Smith & Tucker WRECK Neocons. - May 14, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc)
*  I'm your host Anna Kasparian and today we've got some good news potentially for Palestinians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=0.0s)]
*  in Gaza, but also some bad news potentially. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=11.92s)]
*  So it's a bit of a roller coaster ride of a show today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=15.76s)]
*  But I'm really looking forward to sharing the news with you, including some updates [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=18.52s)]
*  on Donald Trump's tour to the Middle East. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=22.32s)]
*  He gave a speech in Saudi Arabia just yesterday and was very critical of the very individuals [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=25.98s)]
*  that people like Douglas Murray and Mark Levin want to protect because they fall into the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=33.6s)]
*  category of individuals that were attacked by Trump during his speech. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=38.74s)]
*  I love to see it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=42.94s)]
*  And so I'll give you all the details on what's happening foreign policy wide and more. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=44.06s)]
*  We're also gonna talk about what's happening here domestically in the United States. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=49.06s)]
*  So what does that include? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=54.98s)]
*  Well, we gotta talk a little bit about the pharmaceutical industry and how Trump purportedly [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=57.059999999999995s)]
*  wants to lower drug prices. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Although honestly, I'm skeptical because of the way he's going about it and more importantly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=65.86s)]
*  because of the corruption of our Congress by the pharmaceutical lobby. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=70.58s)]
*  So we're gonna talk about all of that and give you updates on some of the other news [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  that we covered this week. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=80.42s)]
*  The other thing I wanted to just quickly mention is that Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=82.94s)]
*  has decided to block a data gathering operation that the Department of Health and Human Services [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=88.14s)]
*  wants to do in their effort to study autism. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=94.36s)]
*  Is that a good idea? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=97.84s)]
*  Is it a bad idea? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=98.84s)]
*  We'll get to the details on that later in the show, but it will be a solo show today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=99.84s)]
*  Unfortunately, my co-host had to call in sick last minute. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=105.3s)]
*  So it's all right, we're gonna do the show. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=109.74s)]
*  We're gonna have a good time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=111.22s)]
*  Please write in, give me some comments so I can interact with you guys in lieu of having [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  a co-host on the show today. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  All right, without further ado, let's get to our first story. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  If Mark Levin is calling the Trump administration anti-Semitic, Steve Wittgoff, we're at the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  end of something and the beginning of something new? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  All these years later, you either have to apologize for your role in this catastrophe [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=132.02s)]
*  or defend your role in this catastrophe and talk about how you still really believe it [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=137.52s)]
*  was the right thing to do. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=141.98s)]
*  But you can't sit here and say, you're not an expert and you're a Jew hater if you say [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=142.98s)]
*  the word neoconservative. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  If you're calling Steve Wittgoff an anti-Semite on Twitter, you know you're losing, right? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  That loser Tucker Carlson is referring to is conservative talk show host Mark Levin, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  a well-known neoconservative lunatic whose foreign policy preferences have fallen out [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  of vogue among Republican voters in recent years for good reason. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=166.72s)]
*  And while I find their rejection of the warmongers who dragged our young American soldiers into [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=171.0s)]
*  multiple Middle East deployments commendable, Levin certainly doesn't agree with me. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=177.26s)]
*  After all, the loudmouth hog was and still is a neocon, a disgusting, bloviating one [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=182.78s)]
*  at that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=189.28s)]
*  Levin has never been shy about cheerleading for US military intervention in the Middle [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=190.78s)]
*  East on behalf of Israel. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=195.74s)]
*  In fact, he's demanding we go to war with Iran on behalf of Israel right now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=198.5s)]
*  So it should come as no surprise that Levin didn't appreciate that Middle East envoy Steve [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=203.12s)]
*  Wittgoff cited neoconservatives in a critical fashion while expressing his interest in diplomatic [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=209.02s)]
*  solutions to foreign conflicts. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=216.10000000000002s)]
*  One element believes that war is the only way to solve things. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=220.42s)]
*  And the president believes that his force of personality, the way he is going to respond [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=225.16s)]
*  to situations can bend people to do things in a much better way in the interest of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=232.32s)]
*  United States government. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=238.32s)]
*  And I believe in that too. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=239.32s)]
*  In response to Wittgoff's statement, Levin did what the right often criticizes the left [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=242.14s)]
*  for doing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=247.64s)]
*  He weaponized identity to shut down criticism that he doesn't like. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  In an X post that of course included the video featuring Wittgoff's statements about neoconservatives, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=253.04s)]
*  Levin declared that neocon is a pejorative for Jew and ended his comments with an unbelievable. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=259.12s)]
*  The only thing that's unbelievable is that Levin tried to play the anti-Semitic card, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=266.8s)]
*  plus he was wrong to do so. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  He's wrong in his statement. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=274.8s)]
*  Neocon has just become a dirty word because no one likes them, which is why Levin's weaponized [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=277.44s)]
*  social media declaration was met with a community note that just simply reads, a neocon is not [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=283.3s)]
*  a pejorative for someone who is Jewish. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=289.24s)]
*  Yeah, now before I go off on neocon scum that absolutely have blood on their hands, I just [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=292.24s)]
*  wanna take a moment to weigh in on Steve Wittgoff. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=299.84s)]
*  The real estate developer was chosen by Trump back in November of 2024 to be his incoming [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=303.48s)]
*  administration's special envoy to the Middle East. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=308.56s)]
*  Which to be quite honest with you guys was concerning because Wittgoff had no diplomatic [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=312.04s)]
*  experience. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=318.04s)]
*  And with the war on Gaza raging, honestly, I expected the worst from Wittgoff. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=319.56s)]
*  But I was pleasantly surprised to learn that he began playing a key role in negotiating [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=324.8s)]
*  a ceasefire and hostage exchange between Israel and Hamas even before Trump was inaugurated [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=330.16s)]
*  for his second term. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=335.8s)]
*  Wittgoff's approach was unconventional considering that Israel was part of the equation. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=337.8s)]
*  According to the Wall Street Journal, Wittgoff sat down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=343.44s)]
*  Netanyahu and reminded him of all the favors Trump carried out for Israel in his first [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=347.6s)]
*  term. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=353.2s)]
*  Meaning the recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and Israel's sovereignty over [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=354.44s)]
*  the occupied Golan Heights. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=360.8s)]
*  Then Wittgoff told the Israeli leader that the president has been a great friend of Israel [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=364.24s)]
*  and now it's time to be a friend back. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=369.34s)]
*  He then played hardball telling the Prime Minister that he needed to allow Israel ceasefire [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=373.52s)]
*  negotiators to make decisions. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  And that if Netanyahu didn't wanna work that way, everyone should just pack their bags [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  and go home. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=385.16s)]
*  What's the point? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=386.16s)]
*  He also was similarly tough with the Arab side of the deal. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  Just a day earlier in Doha, Qatar, Wittgoff told them it was time for an agreement, not [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  endless diplomatic back and forth. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  So immediately after the meeting, Netanyahu sent a key aide and the heads of Israel's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=401.76s)]
*  spy agencies to Doha for an intense week of negotiations that brought a deal which had [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=407.44s)]
*  been moribund just weeks earlier back into play. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=413.8s)]
*  Both Hamas and Israel agreed to the first round of the deal, which would bring dozens [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=418.72s)]
*  of hostages home and stop the unbearable bloodshed for six weeks. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=423.64s)]
*  Wittgoff even flew to Israel on January 29th and made a rare entry into Gaza to personally [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=429.6s)]
*  oversee the ceasefire. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=435.04s)]
*  Now during this time, there was also an increased flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=437.08s)]
*  which of course Israel had purposely been blocking throughout the entirety of the war. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=442.44s)]
*  Because of that deal that Wittgoff helped broker, Hamas released 33 hostages, which [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=447.52s)]
*  is 33 more than Israel was able to free through their genocidal war on Gazans. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=454.76s)]
*  It was also nice to see a change from the Biden-Harris administration, which of course [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=459.64s)]
*  made repeated public statements about how they were pressuring Israel to end the war. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  In reality, they were doing no such thing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=470.48s)]
*  Former Israeli Ambassador Michael Herzog told Israeli press that God did the state of Israel [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=473.76s)]
*  a favor that Biden was the president during this period. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=480.04s)]
*  We fought in Gaza for over a year and the administration never came to us and said ceasefire [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=483.98s)]
*  now. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  They never did, and that's not to be taken for granted. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=490.84s)]
*  I don't take it for granted, I'll never forget. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=495.28s)]
*  Even Obama official Ben Rhodes excoriated the Biden administration's handling of the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=498.4s)]
*  war. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=503.88s)]
*  It was a choice for the United States to unreservedly back what Israel did for that whole year. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=504.88s)]
*  That was a choice. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=511.44s)]
*  It wasn't something that happened because of gravity. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=512.92s)]
*  It wasn't something that happened because politics inevitably means you support Israel [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=514.72s)]
*  unconditionally. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=519.12s)]
*  Joe Biden made a choice to provide unconditional military support to this Israeli government [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=520.28s)]
*  and this military operation. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=525.28s)]
*  And just mouthing words of concern about the scale of loss of life doesn't matter, you [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=527.72s)]
*  made that choice. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=534.28s)]

*  Was she really Kamala Harris was working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=577.6s)]
*  No, she wasn't. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=582.76s)]

*  in exchange for extending the truce for another 50 days. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=630.76s)]
*  But it wouldn't bring the war to an end. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=635.92s)]
*  And look, Netanyahu knew Hamas wouldn't accept the altered deal and that was the whole point. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=638.28s)]
*  Now we know, without a shadow of a doubt, that Israel always intended to expand its [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=644.38s)]

*  Levin? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=744.6999999999999s)]
*  Far more than Hamas has killed. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=745.6999999999999s)]
*  Tens of thousands of children have been slaughtered by the IDF during this current round of war. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=747.6999999999999s)]

*  Nah, even before Levin accused Witkoff of being an anti-Semite, Douglas Murray scoffed [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=776.38s)]
*  at Dave Smith's use of the moniker neoconservative during their debate, if you can call it that, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=783.42s)]

*  If we just went in, because there was this uprising in 2011, and because we were worried [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=792.1s)]
*  that Gaddafi was about to go genocidal, something that your own UK parliament did an investigation [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=796.1s)]

*  Why is it then that I got four star general, Wesley Clark, supreme commander of the NATO [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=805.46s)]
*  forces? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=814.14s)]
*  Why is it that he told me that he saw the plans in 2001 to overthrow Gaddafi, and that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=815.14s)]
*  this was part of a strategy to overthrow seven governments in five years? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=819.5s)]
*  And all of them except one have been done at this point. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=824.1s)]
*  So you're telling me it's a complete coincidence that he saw that the neoconservatives had [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=828.22s)]
*  this plan to overthrow Moammar Gaddafi, and then 10 years later we happen to do it when [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=832.34s)]
*  we have the opportunity? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=836.38s)]
*  The two aren't related at all? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=837.64s)]
*  First, it's nice to hear the N word again. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=838.98s)]
*  The N word? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=843.26s)]
*  Did I say that? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=844.26s)]
*  Neoconservatives. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=845.26s)]
*  That one, I was thinking of a different one. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=846.26s)]
*  That is embarrassing. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=851.26s)]
*  Murray amounting neoconservative to the N word is hilarious, because he literally wrote [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=853.9s)]
*  a book titled Neoconservatism. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=861.3000000000001s)]
*  Why we need it? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=864.34s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=865.34s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=866.34s)]
*  You can see a photo of it. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=867.34s)]
*  I think it was published in 2006 when neoconservatism hadn't fallen out of favor, by the way, among [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=869.34s)]
*  the Republican base. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=876.98s)]
*  But honestly, to Republican voters' credit, they were able to accept the fact that the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=879.3000000000001s)]
*  American people were lied to by the neoconservatives within the Bush administration. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=885.5s)]
*  That Iraq never had weapons of mass destruction. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=890.38s)]
*  That Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=893.74s)]
*  That we were totally tricked by the neoconservatives in the George W Bush administration to strike [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=896.98s)]
*  Iraq in a preemptive war that was a complete and utter freaking disaster. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=904.1800000000001s)]
*  Equating neocon with the N word was Murray's way of signaling that anyone speaking out [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=910.7s)]
*  against the horrific death, destruction and war crimes neocons cheerlead in the Middle [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=916.9s)]
*  East should be condemned. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=923.02s)]
*  It's Murray's way of silencing his opposition, which much to his chagrin, he's failing at. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=925.54s)]
*  I'm amused by it. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=931.1800000000001s)]
*  But I assume the family members of the 4,419 American troops who died in Iraq on behalf [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=932.94s)]
*  of Israel's desires to go to war with Iraq have their own views on neoconservatives. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=940.58s)]
*  The problem for folks like Murray and Levin is that the cat's out of the bag. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=947.1s)]
*  We know too much. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=952.1s)]
*  Smith clearly knows too much. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=953.54s)]
*  Levin and Murray can't defend the indefensible, so they just start attacking those with legitimate [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=956.5s)]
*  critique of whatever. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=961.9s)]
*  They're anti-Semites. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=966.34s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=967.54s)]
*  They've never been, they're not experts. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=969.1s)]
*  But it would be great if they were pressured to contend with reality, as Smith brought [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=971.54s)]
*  up while talking to Tucker Carlson. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=977.3s)]
*  Anybody can read for themselves the clean break memo. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=980.26s)]

*  like, look, here's our plan. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=987.46s)]
*  And the break was from the peace process. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=989.26s)]
*  The break was from Oslo. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=991.98s)]
*  And they go, look, here's the plan. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=993.78s)]
*  You know how Yitzhak Rabin and all these liberal Jews are saying we have to make peace with [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=994.86s)]
*  the Palestinians so that we can then make peace with the broader Arab world? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=999.58s)]
*  Well, no, we got a new plan. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1003.3000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna break with all of that. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1004.98s)]
*  We're not doing this land swap thing. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1006.38s)]
*  We're not giving the Palestinians a state. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1008.2600000000001s)]
*  What we'll do is we'll have America overthrow all of these other governments. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1009.98s)]
*  That way you never have to make peace with the Palestinians and you can just enjoy domination [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1013.0600000000001s)]
*  over the region. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1018.46s)]
*  All these years later, you either have to apologize for your role in this catastrophe [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1019.98s)]
*  or defend your role in this catastrophe and talk about how you still really believe it [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1025.74s)]
*  was the right thing to do. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1030.14s)]
*  But you can't sit here and say, you're not an expert and you're a Jew hater if you say [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1031.14s)]
*  the word neoconservative. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1035.46s)]
*  Smith is right. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1039.18s)]
*  And the substance of what he's saying should be addressed. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1040.22s)]
*  I mean, Iraq, Syria, Libya, the list goes on. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1043.7s)]
*  Also, what I would love to know is whether Murray or Levin think Trump is some sort of [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1048.62s)]

*  The people that are right here, the people that have lived here all their lives developing [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1105.26s)]
*  your own sovereign countries, pursuing your own unique visions and charting your own destinies [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1109.02s)]
*  in your own way. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1115.86s)]
*  It's really incredible what you've done. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1117.54s)]
*  In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built and [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1119.82s)]
*  the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1125.46s)]
*  themselves. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1133.62s)]
*  They told you how to do it, but they had no idea how to do it themselves. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1134.62s)]
*  Peace, prosperity and progress ultimately came not from a radical rejection of your [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1138.34s)]
*  heritage, but rather from embracing your national traditions and embracing that same heritage [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1144.3s)]
*  that you love so dearly. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1150.62s)]
*  Now look, I'm not a sucker. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1153.62s)]
*  I know that Donald Trump forms his opinions and his policy based on who bribed him last [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1156.9799999999998s)]
*  and Qatar and Saudi Arabia are working overtime at the moment. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1162.74s)]
*  And you add the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu is an unsavory, unlikable piece of crap. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1167.46s)]
*  You can kind of understand why Trump is kind of changing his tune in regard to foreign [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1173.5800000000002s)]
*  policy in the Middle East. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1178.14s)]
*  Now finally, Tucker Carlson himself used to be a raging neoconservative and guess what? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1180.46s)]
*  Now he surprisingly expresses a great deal of remorse that that used to be the case. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1187.3s)]
*  I mean, I spent my whole life in cable news. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1192.66s)]
*  It obviously is in terminal decline. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1195.9s)]
*  I had all kinds of views they argued for passionately. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1199.22s)]
*  They were totally wrong. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1201.82s)]
*  I admitted it. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1203.74s)]
*  I gained perspective and humility in admitting it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1204.74s)]
*  It's the only act of liberation that's really possible in this life is freeing yourself [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1208.86s)]
*  from the lies. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1213.9s)]
*  And the number one lie is I'm God. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1215.78s)]
*  And I'm omniscient or was perfectly wise person. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1218.46s)]
*  It's like you make mistakes. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1222.58s)]
*  You're a ridiculous primate. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1224.3799999999999s)]
*  We are ridiculous primates, some more ridiculous than others. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1228.02s)]
*  But credit where credit is due, not many people change their worldview based on new information. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1231.42s)]
*  They usually just attack the messenger instead. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1236.78s)]
*  Smith, Tucker and anyone else on the right side of the political aisle who loaths neocons [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1240.9399999999998s)]
*  are right to do so and they deserve credit for it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1247.74s)]
*  Hopefully, the Democratic Party wisens up, ditches the Cheneys and realizes that no one [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1250.74s)]
*  likes a neocon other than Israel and its allies. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1257.34s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1261.9399999999998s)]
*  Welcome back to TYT. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1270.58s)]
*  I'm your host, Ana Kasparian. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1275.58s)]
*  And I wanna stay on the topic of foreign policy because there's a story that's kind of been [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1277.1799999999998s)]
*  developing over the last several days in regard to the future of the Gaza Strip that everyone [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1281.54s)]
*  should be concerned about, especially Palestinians and Americans. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1288.1s)]
*  Because while we're hearing some more positive news in regard to Donald Trump's foreign policy [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1293.34s)]
*  in the Middle East, it could be for self-serving reasons. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1298.98s)]
*  So let's get into it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1302.7800000000002s)]
*  The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1303.7800000000002s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1310.66s)]
*  other weapons on the site. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1315.9s)]
*  Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1318.18s)]
*  development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1324.02s)]
*  area. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1330.38s)]
*  Well, the question is, who will the people of the area be? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1331.38s)]
*  And according to an exclusive report by Reuters, the United States is in fact weighing the [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1336.78s)]
*  possibility of establishing an American-led provisional government in Gaza. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1342.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I feel like the American government is currently having a difficult time governing [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1350.3799999999999s)]
*  its own country, but I digress. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1355.82s)]
*  So five anonymous sources spoke to Reuters for this story. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1358.8999999999999s)]
*  Here's what we know about it based on their reporting. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1362.18s)]
*  They told reporters that the proposed provisional government would not have Hamas nor the Palestinian [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1365.06s)]
*  authority involved at all. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1372.8799999999999s)]
*  Instead, it would be led by an official from the United States. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1375.58s)]
*  Palestinian technocrats would serve in other roles within the provisional government. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1379.98s)]
*  And by the way, if that's not bad enough, other countries could be invited to join the [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1387.6200000000001s)]
*  government, but Reuters sources did not say which countries. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1393.5800000000002s)]
*  And obviously, that is very concerning. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1397.06s)]
*  Now, currently, there's no timeline for how long that government might last after taking [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1400.38s)]
*  control of the Gaza Strip following the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, which make no mistake [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1406.62s)]
*  about it, Donald Trump is still very much gung-ho on doing. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1411.78s)]
*  Now, the sources compared the proposal to the coalition provisional authority in Iraq [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1415.8999999999999s)]
*  that Washington established in 2003. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1422.86s)]
*  That worked out real well, didn't it? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1425.18s)]
*  Yeah, so the provisional government would oversee Gaza until it's demilitarized and [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1427.5s)]
*  stabilized. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1433.74s)]
*  Keep in mind that Gaza currently doesn't have a military, Hamas doesn't have a military. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1434.74s)]
*  I know we keep referring to what's happening in Gaza as a war, but you kind of need two [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1438.98s)]
*  sides with militaries to engage in a war. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1443.54s)]
*  In reality, you have a bunch of millions of people trapped in a strip of land who are [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1447.68s)]
*  just being bombed indiscriminately, killed indiscriminately. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1452.74s)]
*  This has been the case for well over a year, and Americans are paying for it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1457.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's the current situation in Gaza. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1461.78s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1464.34s)]
*  So last weekend, NBC News reported the following. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1466.22s)]
*  Trump has been frustrated with Netanyahu's decision to begin a new military offensive [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1471.1s)]
*  in Gaza, which the president sees as at odds with his plan for rebuilding there. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1475.86s)]
*  And has said the new Israeli offensive in Gaza is a wasted effort because it will make [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1481.86s)]
*  it harder to rebuild, according to two sources. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1487.12s)]
*  Now understand, Trump has never given us any indication that he wants to rebuild the Gaza [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1489.9s)]
*  Strip on behalf of the Palestinians. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1495.1000000000001s)]
*  He wants to obviously establish an American-led government and rebuild the prime real estate [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1497.94s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip for himself. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1505.18s)]
*  He sees a real estate development opportunity. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1508.74s)]
*  That's what this is really about. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1513.5s)]
*  That's probably the most important motivating factor behind Trump's subtle changes in US [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1515.1399999999999s)]
*  foreign policy toward the Middle East. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1522.34s)]
*  Another red flag is the fact that right-wing Israeli politicians have come out in support [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1524.8799999999999s)]
*  of Trump's proposal. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1529.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's the biggest red flag, let's keep it real. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1531.3s)]
*  And his proposal, again, includes forcibly evacuating ethnically cleansing Palestinian [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1534.6599999999999s)]
*  civilians from the land that they are entitled to. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1541.06s)]
*  But behind closed doors, some Israeli officials have also been weighing proposals over the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1545.5s)]
*  future of Gaza that sources say assumes that there won't be a mass exodus of Palestinians [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1549.98s)]
*  from Gaza, such as a US-led provisional administration. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1555.3600000000001s)]
*  Among those include restricting reconstruction to designated security zones, dividing the [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1559.9s)]
*  territory and establishing permanent military bases, said four sources, who include foreign [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1566.54s)]
*  diplomats and former Israeli officials briefed on the proposals. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1573.8999999999999s)]
*  The future of Gaza, the future of the Palestinian people who have been suffering in Gaza, who [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1580.34s)]
*  have been experiencing their loved ones get slaughtered in Gaza, the future doesn't look [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1586.1399999999999s)]
*  good for them. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1591.1399999999999s)]
*  I want the war to end. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1593.06s)]
*  Obviously, the motivating factors that influence Trump to wanna end the war concern me because [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1595.66s)]
*  it's not really about ending the bloodshed because it's immoral. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1602.1000000000001s)]
*  It's about creating a situation in which the US can come in and essentially engage in a [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1606.78s)]
*  land grab. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1612.8200000000002s)]
*  The Israelis very likely think, yeah, let's make the US think they're gonna benefit from [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1613.98s)]
*  this. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1620.38s)]
*  Obviously, Israel has its own issues with settlers who have been eyeing the Gaza Strip [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1621.82s)]
*  to build settlements for a long time. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1627.14s)]
*  We've already seen flyers and advertising material from various organizations wanting [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1629.42s)]
*  to build settlements in the Gaza Strip. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1634.98s)]
*  And it's so incredibly frustrating that you see what's happening as an American who's [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1638.54s)]
*  totally against this, and you feel powerless to stop it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1644.5s)]
*  But make no mistake. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1649.94s)]
*  Beyond immoral, I don't think the United States should have any business in governing stolen [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1651.22s)]
*  land that had just been ethnically cleansed of Palestinian civilians. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1657.5800000000002s)]
*  And so far, that's one of the proposals that we're seeing coming from the Trump administration. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1662.46s)]
*  Doesn't mean it's necessarily gonna happen. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1667.98s)]
*  Trump is a wild card. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1670.06s)]
*  His policies aren't stable. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1672.7s)]
*  You never know which way he's gonna go in. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1674.14s)]
*  Remember, he was totally in favor of bombing the nuclear sites in Iran. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1676.22s)]
*  But clearly, he has totally backed away from that, says he doesn't want any kind of war [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1683.22s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1687.78s)]
*  He wants to enter a new nuclear deal, which is great. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1688.78s)]
*  I hope he does do that. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1692.54s)]
*  So we don't know if this is actually gonna come true, if he's actually going to try to [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1694.06s)]
*  install some weird American puppet government that might have some Israelis involved. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1699.4199999999998s)]
*  We're gonna have to wait and see. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1703.82s)]
*  But this doesn't look good, and it kind of informs you a little better on why it is that [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1705.6599999999999s)]
*  Trump has soured on Netanyahu. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1712.06s)]
*  Netanyahu wants to continue the war. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1713.86s)]
*  Trump wants it to stop so he can rebuild. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1715.9399999999998s)]
*  But who he wants to rebuild for is the most important detail to the story. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1718.78s)]
*  It ain't for the Palestinians. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1722.4199999999998s)]
*  I wanna talk a little bit about Trump's tour in the Middle East. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1733.74s)]
*  There's a lot to get to here, so bear with me. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1738.78s)]
*  Joe, for the wider world to know this great transformation has not come from Western intervention [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1740.78s)]
*  or flying people in beautiful planes giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1750.34s)]
*  your own affairs. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1758.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, the gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1759.18s)]
*  nation builders, neocons, or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1765.26s)]
*  of dollars failing to develop. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1771.9s)]
*  Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1776.14s)]
*  In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built and [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1780.22s)]
*  the interventionalists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1785.3799999999999s)]
*  themselves. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1793.34s)]
*  Love that statement from Donald Trump who gave a speech while in Saudi Arabia just yesterday. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1796.34s)]
*  Now you just watched a portion of that speech and today he touched down in Qatar. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1802.86s)]
*  So we wanna give you a comprehensive look into this tour in the Middle East, what's [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1808.1s)]
*  coming from it and whether or not the Trump administration has changed its tone as it [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1813.8s)]
*  pertains to Middle East foreign policy. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1820.68s)]
*  So let's dive in. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1823.8s)]
*  So during the speech in Saudi Arabia, Trump made this big announcement about how the Saudis [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1824.8s)]
*  will be purchasing an estimated $150 billion with a B in American weapons. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1830.34s)]
*  And look, they're going to spend $150 billion. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1836.76s)]
*  Let me reword this so it's as accurate as possible. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1841.76s)]
*  Donald Trump did a favor for US-based weapons manufacturers who will now receive $100 billion [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1846.96s)]
*  in Saudi money in order to buy said weapons. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1855.34s)]
*  Okay, these aren't American weapons. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1859.8s)]
*  Sure, they're made by American companies. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1862.68s)]
*  We don't benefit from that at all. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1864.64s)]
*  I wanna be clear about that. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1867.12s)]
*  American citizens don't benefit from that. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1869.08s)]
*  It is a favor, it is a handout, it is a deal that benefits Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1870.72s)]
*  you guys get the point. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1878.96s)]
*  Okay, anyway, there's more on that. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1880.28s)]
*  Let's watch Trump talking about it. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1882.8400000000001s)]
*  Nobody makes military equipment like us. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1885.76s)]
*  We have the best military equipment, the best missiles, the best rockets, the best everything. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1887.64s)]
*  Best submarines, by the way, most lethal weapon in the world. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1892.96s)]
*  In addition to purchases of $142 billion of American-made military equipment by our great [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1897.92s)]
*  Saudi partners, the largest ever. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1906.0s)]
*  So per the White House, the package also includes extensive training and support to build the [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1911.92s)]
*  capacity of the Saudi armed forces, including enhancement of Saudi service academies and [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1917.2s)]
*  military medical services. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1925.0s)]
*  So I gotta be honest, as we're watching Israel use these same weapons, these same bombs to [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1928.0800000000002s)]
*  brutalize and slaughter innocent civilians in Gaza, it's kinda sick to hear Trump touting [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1936.0s)]
*  the lethality of these bombs and these weapons. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1942.5600000000002s)]
*  But anyway, so the weapons deal is part of a larger, according to Trump, $600 billion [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1945.3200000000002s)]
*  investment agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1951.76s)]
*  But honestly, the details on this are slim, okay? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1955.76s)]
*  I have a lot of questions, and unfortunately, at this moment, we don't have enough answers. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1958.68s)]
*  So though the details are unclear, the agreement is being touted like it's made up of Saudi [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1964.28s)]
*  investments into American companies, which would benefit American citizens. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1970.26s)]
*  So the White House states that in Saudi Arabia, President Donald J Trump announced Saudi Arabia's [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1975.86s)]
*  $600 billion commitment to invest in the United States, building economic ties that would [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1980.68s)]
*  will endure for generations to come. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1985.72s)]
*  Saudi Arabian Data Vault is moving forward with plans to invest $20 billion in AI data [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1990.04s)]
*  centers and energy infrastructure in the US. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=1996.8s)]
*  But the White House also admitted that American companies will be investing in Saudi Arabia [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2000.4s)]
*  as well. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2006.3600000000001s)]
*  Google, Data Vault, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD, and Uber are committing to invest $80 billion [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2007.3600000000001s)]
*  in cutting edge transformative technologies in both countries. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2014.56s)]
*  We've gotten a taste of those cutting edge technologies. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2018.6s)]
*  Anyway, so it's unclear if that $600 billion figure is the sum for investment into the [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2021.96s)]
*  US, or if it's just the total sum of investments for both countries. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2032.84s)]
*  There are a lot of details here that are unclear. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2039.0s)]
*  Plus, only some of the deals are actually set in stone at the moment. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2041.76s)]
*  So organizers of the US-Saudi Investment Forum, where the deals were announced, said that [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2046.0s)]
*  145 deals were signed, totaling more than $300 billion, which of course is just half [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2051.56s)]
*  of the total promoted on Tuesday by the White House. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2057.36s)]
*  Elon Musk, by the way, was there. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2061.8s)]
*  He accompanied Trump on the voyage to Saudi Arabia and got some cookies out of it. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2064.7200000000003s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2070.68s)]
*  I think it would be very exciting to have autonomous vehicles here in the kingdom. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2071.68s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2078.96s)]
*  If you're amenable. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2079.96s)]
*  You heard it here from Elon. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2080.96s)]
*  He's bringing his robot taxi to the kingdom. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2081.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2084.9199999999996s)]
*  He has another announcement that he- [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2085.9199999999996s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2088.52s)]
*  So, and I'd also like to thank the kingdom for approving Starlink for maritime and aviation [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2089.52s)]
*  use. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2097.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2098.08s)]
*  Maritime and aviation. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2099.08s)]
*  There you go. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2100.12s)]
*  So, Elon Musk, of course, was there. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2104.12s)]
*  I mean, this is, I remember getting invited. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2106.12s)]
*  It wasn't anything like this, but it was a local political event, a conference. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2109.2s)]
*  I was asked to go host a panel discussion there. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2115.7599999999998s)]
*  And I mean, it was all a charade, like a charade, okay? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2120.48s)]
*  It was all fake. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2124.6s)]
*  It was all just a venue, a platform in which business deals could be made, okay? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2125.64s)]
*  There was nothing cerebral about that experience. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2131.24s)]
*  It was just obvious that all sorts of foreign leaders were coming together in the same location [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2133.64s)]
*  in order to work out business deals. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2139.24s)]
*  And so that's what this is really about, obviously. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2140.92s)]
*  That's why Elon Musk was there to see what kind of business he can get out of it. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2143.92s)]
*  And there were other executives there, including the CEO of NVIDIA, Larry Fink, the CEO of [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2148.92s)]
*  BlackRock. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2154.56s)]
*  Wow, he took a little break to do a little bit of traveling instead of snatching up all [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2155.56s)]
*  the residential real estate in the United States. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2161.28s)]
*  How nice of him. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2163.24s)]
*  Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, was there as well. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2164.24s)]
*  Who wasn't there was also interesting. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2171.24s)]
*  So Jeff Bezos, of course, not a fan of Saudi Arabia after the Saudi Crown Prince ordered [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2173.28s)]
*  the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, who was in fact a writer for the Washington [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2180.2799999999997s)]
*  Post, a paper that Jeff Bezos owns. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2186.24s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't go to Saudi Arabia, and neither did Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2188.04s)]
*  He was not present either. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2192.64s)]
*  So let's pivot to a big announcement that Trump made in Saudi Arabia in regard to his [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2194.7599999999998s)]
*  administration lifting all sanctions on Syria after the leaders of Turkey and Saudi Arabia [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2200.08s)]
*  asked him to do so. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2207.62s)]
*  And by the way, Israel, for whatever reason, was urging him against doing this, but Trump [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2209.96s)]
*  did it anyway. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2214.08s)]
*  An Israeli official told CNN that when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump in Washington [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2215.28s)]
*  in April, he asked the president not to remove sanctions on Syria. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2221.1400000000003s)]
*  But apparently Netanyahu was unable to get his way. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2225.8s)]
*  And so Trump did pay lip service to the normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2229.36s)]
*  during his time there, but said that Saudi Arabia could pursue the normalization on their [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2235.2s)]
*  own time. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2242.92s)]
*  I love it. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2244.08s)]
*  So Trump even met with interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharah. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  And Trump's meeting with Sharah was the first meeting between a United States president [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2251.3999999999996s)]
*  and Syrian president in 25 years. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2256.16s)]
*  So it was a pretty big deal. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2258.8399999999997s)]
*  Obviously, this is the guy who succeeded in toppling Bashar al-Assad's regime. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2259.92s)]
*  And until recently, al-Sharah had a $10 million US bounty on his head, but things are different [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2265.4s)]
*  now. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2273.28s)]
*  Al-Sharah was placed on the US specially designated global terrorist list in 2013 for heading [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2274.28s)]
*  Al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, known as al-Nusra Front and allegedly orchestrating suicide [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2281.92s)]
*  bombings across Syria. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2289.3199999999997s)]
*  Stand up guy. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2291.7999999999997s)]
*  Now al-Sharah just led the insurgency and toppled the Assad regime. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2292.92s)]
*  He requested that al-Sharah, Trump did, tell all foreign terrorists to leave Syria, deport [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2298.24s)]
*  Palestinian terrorists, normalize relations with Israel and help prevent ISIS from reemerging. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2304.48s)]
*  He also said this. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2311.0s)]
*  How did you find a Syrian president? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2312.88s)]
*  Right, I think we're a good young, attractive guy, tough guy. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2314.88s)]
*  Strong pass, or strong pass fighter. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2320.04s)]
*  But he's got a real shot at pulling it together. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2324.88s)]
*  He was a terrorist like yesterday. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2331.28s)]
*  But he was a young, strong guy. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2333.28s)]
*  He's a young, strong guy. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2336.16s)]
*  We wanted Assad gone, he wasn't friendly to Israel. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2340.32s)]
*  So the United States along with Israel help support the rebels in the toppling of Bashar [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2344.48s)]
*  al-Assad. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2351.7200000000003s)]
*  So anyway, look, I just find it hilarious that Israel didn't want the US to lift sanctions [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2353.4s)]
*  on Syria given the fact that Israel wanted the toppling of Bashar al-Assad probably more [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2361.1200000000003s)]
*  than any other country. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2367.0400000000004s)]
*  They got their way and they immediately went on to grab hold of Syrian land. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2369.3s)]
*  That's what they did. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2376.54s)]
*  It's just amazing to me. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2378.82s)]
*  You have to kind of see everything, take a step back and see the bigger picture, right? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2380.94s)]
*  Because it's not just one story in a vacuum that's gonna help you make sense of the foreign [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2385.6200000000003s)]
*  policy the United States engages in. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2390.5s)]
*  We have someone who was a terrorist like not too long ago, now serving as the leader of [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2394.56s)]
*  Syria. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2401.74s)]
*  And because of the fact that he's not Bashar al-Assad, who by the way was a brutal dictator [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2403.66s)]
*  himself. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2408.06s)]
*  But a brutal dictator that Israel didn't like, okay? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2409.06s)]
*  Now this new guy, a little friendlier to Israel and all the rhetoric about terrorism changes [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2413.18s)]
*  when it comes to Donald Trump. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2418.84s)]
*  Suddenly, what terrorism? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2420.66s)]
*  He's a young, strong guy. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2422.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2423.34s)]
*  I don't want war with Syria. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2424.42s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2425.7000000000003s)]
*  It's just when you literally have American college students being referred to as terrorists [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2427.2200000000003s)]
*  by the Trump administration for engaging in their First Amendment rights, protesting and [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2436.02s)]
*  calling out and criticizing a foreign government. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2442.06s)]
*  It just kind of makes you think when the new leader of Syria, who was aiding and abetting [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2445.4s)]
*  Al-Qaeda, is now being referred to as some hero, some great, strong young guy. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2451.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay, whatever. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2457.02s)]
*  It's just sick. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2458.2999999999997s)]
*  All of it is really sick when you think about it. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2459.2999999999997s)]
*  I just wanna get the hell out of the Middle East. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2460.98s)]
*  I wanna stop spending money on all this nonsense in the Middle East. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2462.9s)]
*  I really do. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2467.42s)]
*  Unfortunately, I don't think we're ever gonna get out of that. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2468.42s)]
*  And I just can't stand the announcement of these deals as if it's gonna benefit all Americans. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2472.16s)]
*  We're not just civilians. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2477.9s)]
*  We're really gonna benefit from Saudi Arabia spending hundreds of billions of dollars on [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2478.9s)]
*  weapons. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2485.34s)]
*  That just fattens the pockets of defense contractors. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2486.62s)]
*  That does nothing for us. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2489.34s)]
*  Okay, keep some of the American workers at these companies employed. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2491.3s)]
*  Great. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2497.14s)]
*  But I would rather that not be our top export. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2498.56s)]
*  I would rather we not export as many weapons, missiles, bombs as we do. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2502.38s)]
*  But defense contractors have just as much say and just as much sway over our government [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2508.38s)]
*  as Israel does. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2515.3s)]
*  So there you go, we're supposed to celebrate Saudi Arabia spending hundreds of billions [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2516.82s)]
*  of dollars on US weapons. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2523.38s)]
*  Great, okay. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2524.78s)]
*  So a few more details. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2525.78s)]
*  Trump even met with, so he met with the president, the new president of Syria, the interim president [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2528.86s)]
*  of Syria. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2533.94s)]
*  I'm sure they'll have democratic elections and everything. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2534.94s)]
*  Any day now it'll happen. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2537.1800000000003s)]
*  But I also wanna talk a little bit about one more thing, Qatar. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2540.94s)]
*  So Trump did arrive in Qatar today and was greeted by a motorcade that Qatar put together [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2545.5s)]
*  that included two Tesla cyber trucks. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2552.78s)]
*  Trump announced today that Qatar Airways will be buying 210 Boeing jets, which according [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2555.42s)]
*  to the president is the largest order of jets in Boeing's history. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2562.02s)]
*  I don't really give a crap about that at all. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2565.9s)]
*  But nonetheless, the president boasted that the deal was worth $200 billion. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2568.7000000000003s)]
*  But a fact sheet from the White House said the true number was $96 billion. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2572.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't care how much money it is. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2579.58s)]
*  I would rather the amount be zero. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2581.2200000000003s)]
*  But there's more money for defense contractors where that came from. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2584.3s)]
*  Qatar and the United States signed a statement of defense cooperation that includes a $1 [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2588.3s)]
*  billion agreement with Raytheon for Qatar's acquisition of counter drone capabilities. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2593.5s)]
*  A nearly $2 billion agreement with General Atomics for Qatar's acquisition of a remotely [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2601.0600000000004s)]
*  piloted aircraft system. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2608.5800000000004s)]
*  And $38 billion in potential investments including support for burden sharing at AIU-D Air Base, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2610.86s)]
*  I don't know how to pronounce that, which houses Qatari American and British Airmen. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2620.7000000000003s)]
*  In total, the White House said the deals announced by Trump amounted to more than $243 billion [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2624.7000000000003s)]
*  between the United States and Qatar. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2630.2200000000003s)]
*  The Trump administration also said the agreements with Qatar were expected to generate an economic [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2632.26s)]
*  exchange of $1.2 trillion. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2637.46s)]
*  Though it was unclear how the administration arrived at that figure. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2640.94s)]
*  I can tell you how they arrived at that figure. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2644.9s)]
*  They took their hand, they shoved it up their own asses, and they pulled something out. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2647.3s)]
*  That's how they arrived at that conclusion. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2652.7000000000003s)]
*  The conclusion I have arrived at is that we need to take a break. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2655.2400000000002s)]
*  So we're gonna do that and we'll be right back. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2657.82s)]
*  Diddy D writes in and says, I remember Democrats demanding that New Jersey Senator resign for [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2667.38s)]
*  taking gold bars from Egypt. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2676.54s)]
*  Where are the Republicans demanding Trump resign for taking a $400 million plane from [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2678.9s)]
*  Qatar? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2684.06s)]
*  Diddy D, first of all, you bring up a really important question. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2685.06s)]
*  So I'm gonna do my best to answer it because there is a difference here and it's not about [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2689.2400000000002s)]
*  morality believe it or not. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2692.6600000000003s)]
*  I think if Bob Menendez, okay, that's the senator that you were referring to. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2693.94s)]
*  If he were a popular politician with the Democratic base and Democratic lawmakers knew that they [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2702.3s)]
*  would face significant backlash for calling on him to resign, they wouldn't call on him [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2708.82s)]
*  to resign. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2714.58s)]
*  These politicians are total and utter cowards. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2715.82s)]
*  And so the only reason why Republicans in Congress don't really speak out against Donald [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2720.94s)]
*  Trump even when they disagree with what he's doing is because they're afraid of his base. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2727.1s)]
*  Make no mistake about that. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2731.86s)]
*  Now if he's proposing something that his base isn't responding well to, well in those instances [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2733.62s)]
*  you might see some backlash, light backlash from Republican lawmakers, but they would [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2739.9s)]
*  never call on him to resign. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2744.86s)]
*  And so they've been criticizing the notion of him accepting that plane. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2747.1s)]
*  But again, as you mentioned and you're correct, they have not called on him to resign. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2751.9s)]
*  I mean, for him to step down, come on, that would never happen. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2755.98s)]
*  All right, let's actually get to our next story. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2759.2599999999998s)]
*  I wanna move on to some domestic policy because as we shared with you earlier this week, Donald [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2761.9s)]
*  Trump says that he wants pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2768.58s)]
*  What's really behind that? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2773.74s)]
*  Is it just lip service? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2774.98s)]
*  Is he just trying to trick us all or is there something substantive behind it? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2776.86s)]
*  Let's get to the details. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2780.2200000000003s)]
*  For many years we were taken advantage of by other countries and the drug companies, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2781.2200000000003s)]
*  but I blame the other countries in a way more, the European Union, etc. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2786.06s)]
*  They were very nasty and very tough to the drug companies and they would give them a [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2790.1800000000003s)]
*  very low price for drug costs in the European nations. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2795.46s)]
*  And when that price was given, that was it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2800.38s)]
*  They wouldn't negotiate it. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2803.1s)]
*  They said let America pay for the difference. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2804.58s)]
*  And now after studying the industry, it's a very complex industry, but I figured it [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2807.14s)]
*  out and I said it's not gonna happen. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2811.2599999999998s)]
*  No one knew the pharmaceutical industry could be so complicated. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2817.3399999999997s)]
*  Did you know? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2820.9s)]
*  I didn't know, no one knew. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2821.9s)]
*  No, but in all seriousness, don't worry. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2822.9s)]
*  Donald Trump has it all figured out for us and he's gonna be the cop that stops the price [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2826.9s)]
*  gouging, allegedly. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2830.86s)]
*  So there he was during a softball interview with Sean Hannity on Air Force One, of course. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2833.62s)]
*  This took place last night, touting his new initiative to lower drug prices. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2839.58s)]
*  And look, honestly, our politicians are so pathetic and so bought by big pharma that [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2843.14s)]
*  just hearing a politician, especially a president, call out the price gougers in the pharmaceutical [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2849.44s)]
*  industry feels nice. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2856.02s)]
*  It would feel better if something substantive is actually done, so we're no longer price [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2858.5s)]
*  gouged. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2863.58s)]
*  So Medicare can actually do the unthinkable, negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2864.58s)]
*  lower drug prices, so American taxpayers aren't getting screwed by getting price gouged. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2869.46s)]
*  Now the idea of his so-called most favored nation policy is to essentially force drug [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2876.14s)]
*  companies to match the lower prices they charge to other countries for the United States. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2882.18s)]
*  So we wouldn't pay more than other developed countries, we would be paying the same amount. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2890.1s)]
*  So if drug makers don't do it voluntarily, the administration is threatening to directly [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2895.0s)]
*  tie drug prices paid by government programs like Medicare to those paid in other countries. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2898.8999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so we're gonna get to whether he can even unilaterally do that in just a moment. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2905.2999999999997s)]
*  Let me give you some more details because he also said that the US market would be open [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2912.3s)]
*  to imports from other countries and that he would investigate the drug companies that [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2916.94s)]
*  don't comply. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2922.5s)]
*  My understanding is that we already import pretty much all drugs from other countries [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2925.3s)]
*  because drug companies have offshored manufacturing of vital, critical, important pharmaceutical [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2929.9s)]
*  drugs to other countries to increase their profits. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2937.18s)]
*  Labor, higher profits, that happens in this industry as well. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2941.5s)]
*  But nonetheless, again, I'm coming in hot. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2947.5s)]
*  I haven't shared anything negative yet, right? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2951.58s)]
*  So far everything we're seeing and hearing from Trump on this matter appears on the surface [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2953.42s)]
*  as very positive. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2958.56s)]
*  It's something that we've been wanting. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2959.7s)]
*  The thing is, talk is cheap. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2961.7s)]
*  So I would love nothing more, much to the chagrin of a portion of this audience, to come [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2965.1s)]
*  on the show and celebrate Trump and the Republicans actually doing something material, something [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2970.86s)]
*  real to lower drug prices. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2977.86s)]
*  But it ain't happened yet. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2979.34s)]
*  And keep in mind, he played this game in his first term as well. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2981.7000000000003s)]
*  So no cookies for you until something's actually done. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2985.78s)]
*  But let me continue. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2988.94s)]
*  Look, he's obviously correct that Americans are paying far more than other nations for [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2989.94s)]
*  the exact same pharmaceutical drugs. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2996.04s)]
*  US prescription drug prices are two to three times higher on average than those in other [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=2998.7400000000002s)]
*  developed nations. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3003.6s)]
*  And up to ten times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corporation, a public [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3005.1800000000003s)]
*  policy think tank. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3010.9s)]
*  And to add insult to injury, American taxpayers oftentimes fund the research and development [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3012.98s)]
*  of these very pharmaceutical drugs that we're now getting price gouged on. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3021.36s)]
*  They get grants through the National Institutes of Health. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3026.72s)]
*  And if we're gonna be funding the research and development of these drugs, we should [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3030.3799999999997s)]
*  enjoy some of those profits or get a deep discount on those drugs, but that ain't happening. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3037.1s)]
*  And that is beyond unfair, beyond unjust. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3043.8199999999997s)]
*  And I'm sure Americans across the political spectrum agree with me on that. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3047.9399999999996s)]
*  No American should be price gouged on life saving medication. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3052.7s)]
*  And the fact that we are is absolutely ludicrous. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3056.8199999999997s)]
*  But anyway, so as we discussed when that executive order was announced, it's not really clear [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3061.74s)]
*  whether Donald Trump has the legal authority to basically enforce an executive order. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3068.8199999999997s)]
*  He can't just unilaterally do everything he wants to do. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3076.5s)]
*  I don't wanna say unfortunately, but it is unfortunate in this current moment that Congress [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3081.74s)]
*  needs to pass legislation. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3086.06s)]
*  And I say that it's unfortunate because Congress is garbage, okay? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3087.46s)]
*  You have hundreds of elected lawmakers who have no interest in doing anything beneficial [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3091.08s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3096.66s)]
*  And so they hold these Kabuki theater hearings to get their cute little sound bites that [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3098.7999999999997s)]
*  they then spread all over social media to get a nice little pat on the back as if they're [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3104.06s)]
*  governing. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3108.66s)]
*  They don't do anything, okay? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3109.8199999999997s)]
*  They don't do much, that's for sure. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3111.5s)]
*  Yeah, they'll raise the debt ceiling because they have to. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3114.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it would destroy the global economy if they don't. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3117.8199999999997s)]
*  They'll pass a budget. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3121.02s)]
*  They'll of course, increase funding for our military industrial complex. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3122.98s)]
*  But when it comes to bread and butter issues, when it comes to solving the very real problems [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3128.42s)]
*  that the American people are faced with, Congress doesn't do much. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3133.62s)]
*  So that's why I say, unfortunately, it is very likely that Trump needs Congress to pass [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3138.4s)]
*  legislation and I don't really have any hope there. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3146.54s)]
*  Because Republican lawmakers opposed including a most favored nation provision in their big [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3149.36s)]
*  beautiful budget bill that Trump has been touting. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3157.08s)]
*  So it seems like it's dead on arrival in Congress. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3161.64s)]
*  Very unlikely Trump is able to lower drug prices unilaterally through executive order. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3165.8s)]
*  But unsurprisingly, during his interview with Hannity, Donald Trump decided to lay the blame [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3170.8s)]
*  for high drug prices at the Democrats' feet. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3176.0s)]
*  Pharmaceutical industry is very powerful and probably the most powerful, considered the [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3179.52s)]
*  most powerful lobby. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3186.32s)]
*  And the Democrats were making it impossible to lower drug prices. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3187.32s)]
*  They knew what they were doing. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3191.84s)]
*  The Democrats never wanted to play ball. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3193.56s)]
*  They never wanted to do anything. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3195.64s)]
*  It's the Democrats' fault that people were being ripped off for years and years. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3197.2s)]
*  The Democrats fought very hard to keep the prices of drugs very, very high. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3201.32s)]
*  They really ought to blame for this because they should have done something about it. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3206.56s)]
*  And when the Republicans went with requests, they said we're not going to approve it. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3210.44s)]
*  Look, to be sure, Democrats are partly to blame for astronomical pharmaceutical drug [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3217.4s)]
*  prices. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3223.2000000000003s)]
*  They have played a role in aiding and abetting big pharma because they're also corrupted [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3224.2000000000003s)]
*  by big pharma. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3227.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, just go back to the debates that were taking place among members of the Democratic [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3228.6800000000003s)]
*  Party in the Senate as they were trying to pass Biden's agenda, which was supposed to [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3234.88s)]
*  allow for Medicaid to negotiate all drug prices. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3241.6800000000003s)]
*  That got watered down because of people like former, luckily, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3245.72s)]
*  people like Kyrsten Sinema. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3252.52s)]
*  So yes, there is some blame to go around and include that blame with the Democratic Party. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3254.68s)]
*  However, however, in the 2023-2024 election cycle, Dems took $37.5 million from the pharmaceutical [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3260.16s)]
*  companies and health products industries with 58% of total contributions. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3268.0s)]
*  Plus, although big pharma has supported more Republicans historically, that favorability [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3274.36s)]
*  reversed in 2020. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3280.28s)]
*  With former Vice President Kamala Harris receiving nearly six times more funding support from [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3283.2400000000002s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies in the 2024 election compared to President Donald Trump. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3288.26s)]
*  So they're working overtime, bribing everyone to prevent the passage of any legislation, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3294.52s)]
*  to prevent the action of any presidential administration that would eat away or cut [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3300.96s)]
*  into their profits. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3306.28s)]
*  They've got that fiduciary responsibility, everyone, that fun word. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3309.48s)]
*  You gotta look out for the investors, the shareholders, return on investment reigns [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3312.92s)]
*  supreme. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3317.96s)]
*  It's the most important thing in this country. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3318.96s)]
*  That's why people who freak out about the stock market crack me up. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3321.2400000000002s)]
*  What are you, a day trader? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3325.52s)]
*  Is that why you're freaking out? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3326.8s)]
*  Okay, well, you're playing with fire. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3328.6s)]
*  This country values the stock market more than anything else, period, end of story. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3331.0s)]
*  Our politicians are heavily invested in the stock market. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3336.44s)]

*  I'm not worried about that, okay? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3358.0s)]
*  But to say Republicans have been martyrs, they've been martyrs, everyone, just pushing [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3360.64s)]

*  So in 2022, Congress approved a law allowing Medicare to negotiate the price it pays for [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3371.32s)]
*  a handful of prescription drugs, starting in 2026. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3377.52s)]
*  It hasn't even started yet, okay? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3382.56s)]
*  They passed this in 2022, and it doesn't go into effect until 2026. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3384.64s)]
*  It's like, let's hope that someone comes in and reverses this, okay? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3389.3199999999997s)]
*  Pharmaceutical companies are not happy about this. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3394.56s)]
*  That same year, the pharmaceutical industry's leading lobbying organization contributed [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3398.0s)]
*  $7.5 million to the American Action Network, a group linked to House Republicans, according [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3401.96s)]

*  Okay. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3412.56s)]
*  So this isn't just a recent thing. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3414.12s)]
*  All the way back in 2007, Republican senators blocked another proposal to allow Medicare [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3417.48s)]
*  to negotiate for lower drug prices. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3423.12s)]
*  And Trump's not off the hook either. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3426.3599999999997s)]
*  On Inauguration Day, Trump signed an executive order reversing, reversing initiatives aimed [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3428.56s)]
*  at reducing prescription drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid recipients, expanding the Affordable [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3435.7599999999998s)]
*  Care Act, and increasing protections for Medicaid enrollees. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3442.38s)]
*  I would love to live in a world where a politician says something, isn't lying about it, and [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3449.58s)]
*  actually does it. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3456.42s)]
*  But guys, we don't live in that world, and we don't have that type of politician in this [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3458.54s)]
*  country. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3462.46s)]
*  Maybe a few in Congress. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3463.46s)]
*  If Bernie Sanders was president, I would totally believe that he would fight to lower drug [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3465.8s)]
*  prices, and really fight, not pretend to fight like Biden did. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3470.16s)]
*  But aside from him, and maybe a few others, just know politicians talking, they're lying. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3475.2s)]
*  You should never take their word at face value. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3484.04s)]
*  And so until I see some meat here, until I see a real plan, no cookies for you, Trump. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3488.06s)]
*  You don't deserve it. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3495.68s)]
*  This isn't our first rodeo. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3497.08s)]
*  You did this in your first term, either put up or shut up. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3498.68s)]
*  For us, we're gonna take a break. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3503.48s)]
*  We'll be right back with more. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDl5zYYnQtc&t=3504.8399999999997s)]
