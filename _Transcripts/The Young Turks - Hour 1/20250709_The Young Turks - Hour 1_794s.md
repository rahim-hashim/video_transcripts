"The question facing Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas at a news conference on Tuesday was whether he would call for an investigation into possible failures surrounding the deadly floods, which include a lack of state and local spending on flood control measures and warning systems.
To answer, Mr. Abbott said asking about blame was ‚Äúthe word choice of losers,‚Äù and then invoked a beloved Texas tradition ‚Äî football ‚Äî as he deflected questions about accountability for a disaster that has left at least 111 people dead and more than 170 missing."

# Gov. Greg Abbott Holds BIZARRE Press Conference About Texas Flooding
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY)
*  You asked him to use your words. Who's to blame? Know this. That's the word choice of losers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=0.0s)]
*  That's my governor. So in the wake of the catastrophic Texas flooding that killed over [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=22.32s)]
*  120 people, including 27 young campers, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas made it clear that he is not [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=30.96s)]
*  interested in assigning blame to any person or agency for the massive death toll. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=37.76s)]
*  And to make his point, he used this very bizarre and I think unnecessary football analogy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=42.64s)]
*  Let me explain one thing about Texas. And that is Texas, every square inch of our state, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=48.8s)]
*  cares about football. You could be in Hunt, Texas, Huntsville, Texas, Houston, Texas, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=57.44s)]
*  any size community that care about football. High school, Friday night lights, college football [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  or pro. And know this, every football team makes mistakes. The losing teams are the ones that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=69.44s)]
*  try to point out who's to blame. The championship teams are the ones that say, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=76.24s)]
*  don't worry about it, man, we got this. We're gonna make sure that we go score again, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=81.28s)]
*  then we're gonna win this game. The way winners talk is not to point fingers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=85.28s)]
*  They talk about solutions. What Texas is all about is solutions. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  I'm exhausted. That metaphor went on for way longer than it needed to. But as weird as that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=94.32s)]
*  metaphor was, Abbott did say the Texas legislature would be investigating the flash floods and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=101.68s)]
*  trying to figure out how similar tragedies can be prevented in the future. Before we talk about [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=107.68s)]
*  whether there is actually a culprit to blame was as a non-Texan. I wanna get your initial thoughts [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  on what my governor just had to say. What do you think? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, I may not be a Texan, but I was a former football player, high school to be exact. I played [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  cornerback varsity. Yeah, I had my varsity letters in football. Yeah, I'm just saying. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=127.36s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=132.0s)]
*  No biggie. No, but seriously, to get at what he said in football, we don't point fingers. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=133.44s)]
*  He's actually exactly wrong about that. He actually couldn't be more wrong about what he just said. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=141.04s)]
*  Because win or lose in football, the next day that you show up to practice or work or whatever [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=148.32s)]
*  you're calling it, whether it's high school, college or the pro level, you have what we call [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=154.56s)]
*  film session where win or lose those plays where you were not at your best. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  We pointed out in front of the entire team and be like, look, Lambray, you messed that up right [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=167.6s)]
*  there. Next time, you're gonna do way better. And famously, actually, Bill Belichick in the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=172.72s)]
*  New England Patriots, the most winning coach in the history of football, probably the greatest [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=178.4s)]
*  football coach ever famously would even rip Tom Brady in film sessions. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=183.76s)]
*  That was part of the culture. Nobody was above the film sessions. Everybody had to do their jobs. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=189.28s)]
*  And even Tom Brady was held to account at these film sessions. So that's the difference [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  between actual people who played football and who actually hold this ethos and this idiot, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=200.72s)]
*  Greg Abbott, is that no, actually, you should be taking account and actually holding yourself [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=206.32s)]
*  and those around you accountable for this awfully grave mistake that was made. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=212.64s)]
*  Yeah, okay, so I was wondering about that. I'm not an athlete. I've never been an athlete, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=216.88s)]
*  but I did just watch Ted Lasso and I was like, that's not what they do on Ted Lasso. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=221.76s)]
*  That's not what they do in any sport. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=226.0s)]
*  I mean, Abbott, he's right about one thing. Football is a weird big deal here in Texas. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=228.48s)]
*  I don't get it, but I don't consider myself a real Texan. Friday Night Lights, that is real. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=233.44s)]
*  But in high school, I went to every varsity game in high school because it was just the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  thing to do on Friday nights. I don't think I ever paid attention to the game, but I was there [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=242.48s)]
*  and it was a good time. But he is wrong about everything else that he did say. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=246.72s)]
*  So naturally, there has been a lot of discussion and debate about how 120 people could be killed [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  in a flash flooding event. And many Democrats have pointed the finger at Donald Trump in part [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  because the Trump administration has proposed a 25% cut to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=264.48s)]
*  Administration's current annual budget of $6.1 billion. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=270.88s)]
*  NOAA is the agency which oversees the National Weather Service. To be fair though, those cuts [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=275.6s)]
*  would not take effect in October. Will they go into effect in October of this year? So they [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=281.52s)]
*  wouldn't have contributed to this particular case. However, that's not to say that reduced [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=287.12s)]
*  resources won't impact natural disaster forecasting in the future. It is true though, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=292.8s)]
*  that the staffing levels of the NWS have already been reduced thanks to DOGE. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=298.24s)]
*  So in total, the NWS lost 600 of its approximately 4,200 staff, causing several [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=303.2s)]
*  offices across the country to operate without the necessary staffing. However, climate experts' [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=309.68s)]
*  opinions on whether the staffing cuts impacted the response in Texas are a little bit mixed. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=316.16s)]
*  Some said that the NWS forecast and flood warnings last week were as adequate as [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=321.92s)]
*  they could have expected to be. And then there is the lack of emergency warning system along [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=328.16s)]
*  the Guadalupe River, which local officials have been talking about for years. So since 2016, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  the topic of a flood warning system for Kerr County has come up at 20 different county [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=340.16s)]
*  commissioners meetings. In March of 2016, then Commissioner Tom Moser noted other Texas locations [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=345.68s)]
*  had these state of the art flood warning sirens, but they weren't used locally, even though this [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=352.72s)]
*  is probably one of the highest flood prone regions in the entire state, according to the meeting [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=358.8s)]
*  minutes. But the county was not able to secure FEMA grant funding to implement the system. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  So it seems like there is a multitude of factors that contributed to the very high death toll, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=371.36s)]
*  and it seems to just keep climbing. It is hard to assign blame on any one person or policy though. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=376.08s)]
*  So Republicans are accusing Democrats of using a tragedy to score political points, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  which is something they definitely wouldn't know anything about. But similar to Greg Abbott, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz, he scolded anyone trying to blame their political opponents for a natural [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=393.68s)]
*  disaster. By the way, this is the same guy who blamed Democrats for the Los Angeles fires, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  and then threatened to withhold disaster aid from California. But I'm sure that has nothing to do [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=405.44s)]
*  with this right here. Also White House spokesperson Caroline Leavitt agreed with Ted Cruz. Take a look. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=411.04s)]
*  And many Democrat elected officials are trying to turn this into a political game, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=417.36s)]
*  and it is not. This is a national tragedy. Do you think those comments are depraved and despicable, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=423.04s)]
*  especially when so many Americans are mourning the loss of their children? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=428.64s)]
*  Okay, but one person who had absolutely no issue bucking responsibility and pointing the finger was [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=435.52s)]
*  President Donald Trump. Less than 24 hours before Leavitt's comments, Trump said that while he [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=442.0s)]
*  didn't necessarily want to blame Joe Biden for the flood, he said this, my God, if you look at [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=447.44s)]
*  that water situation, that was really the Biden setup. I don't even know what that means. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=454.0s)]
*  I don't know what that means. Okay, before I get your thoughts on this, I need to mention this. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=462.0s)]
*  Right before the show, reporting came out that if anyone is to blame for the slow emergency response, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=468.24s)]
*  it might actually be Christy Noem. As the Homeland Security Secretary, she oversees FEMA, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=474.32s)]
*  and she recently enacted a rule that any contract or grant over $100,000 requires [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=480.16s)]
*  her personal sign off before the funds can be released. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=486.4s)]
*  So it was meant to be a cost cutting measure that she was implementing for the department, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=489.2s)]
*  but it's obviously not the most efficient. It cuts a lot of the autonomy that the department [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  would have. So when FEMA would have started to act, like sending help and resources and aid to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=498.4s)]
*  the affected area, they quickly realized that they were unable to do so. They were knee capped, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=504.0s)]
*  and they just couldn't do so without getting Christy Noem's approval. So I wanna go back to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=509.12s)]
*  that Trump quote, cuz I read it and I was like, what? If you look at that water situation that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=514.8s)]
*  was really the Biden setup was, what do you make of that? Cuz I got nothing. I don't know what that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=519.8399999999999s)]
*  is. What water situation, what Biden setup did? It's so nonsensical. And the thing is, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=526.0s)]
*  this river, it flows through the Texas Hill Country. It's a very popular tourist destination, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  especially this time of year. It's already so hot here in Texas. That is where you go to cool off. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  You go to the Hill Country, there's trees, there's shade, and you float the rivers, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=544.56s)]
*  and it's a very nice time. But the thing is, and I think this is a problem across a lot of Texas, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  they don't wanna spend a lot of money on preventative measures, right? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=555.68s)]
*  And as you saw from those meeting minutes in Kerr County, they didn't spend the money [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=559.1199999999999s)]
*  on getting those sirens for the flood warning system, even though that is an area that was very, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=564.4s)]
*  very prone to flooding. I know here in Houston and in the Galveston area, there's a lot of concern [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=569.6s)]
*  about the Galveston seawall, which protects a lot of the inland places and the island of Galveston [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=575.28s)]
*  from hurricanes and from storm surges and things like that. And it's also kind of like, it's a big [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=580.96s)]
*  problem. Cuz here in Houston, we have the Houston Ship Channel, which is a lot of oil refineries [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  and things like that. But they really just, they don't invest money on these preventative measures, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=592.32s)]
*  because if a big hurricane did come, which is not out of the question, and have a direct hit on [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=597.52s)]
*  Houston and the Ship Channel, which is not out of the question, it would be a disaster, not just for [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=602.96s)]
*  Houston, not just for Texas, but for the whole country. When I read that Trump statement, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=607.92s)]
*  it honestly reminds me of Ron Burgundy from one of the greatest movies ever, Anchorman. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=614.48s)]
*  And the fact that he's kind of just programmed to read whatever is on that teleprompter, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=619.6s)]
*  Trump is programmed to blame literally anything and everything on Joe Biden. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=624.88s)]
*  It just doesn't matter what the situation is, what the topic is. If it has a potential to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=629.3599999999999s)]
*  make him look bad, he's going to reflexively blame Biden as if Biden and his administration [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=636.4799999999999s)]
*  built up the infrastructure in this town in Texas. As if Joe Biden had anything to do with this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=642.4s)]
*  It's made even more rich by his press secretary going up there and saying, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=649.84s)]
*  you shouldn't be blaming people for political points. And then Trump does exactly that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=655.12s)]
*  It's amazing that clip came right before, well, that's cheap. That's just like the Democrats, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=660.96s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, scoring cheap points. That's disgusting. People are mourning. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  And then Trump's like, blame Biden. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=669.2800000000001s)]
*  Biden. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=670.56s)]
*  For the water situation, for that water situation. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=673.28s)]
*  That's a whole Biden setup. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=676.2399999999999s)]
*  I feel like in his mind, in Trump's mind, Biden's just out there like, I don't know. I don't know [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=680.16s)]
*  what he thinks is happening. I don't know. Is Joe Biden out there digging canals in Texas? I don't [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=686.56s)]
*  know what he thinks is happening. I don't think what he thinks. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  I think he knows that whatever comes out of his mouth, his biggest fans find plausible. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=696.32s)]
*  And so if he can get just those people on board with him, then it's worth it to do, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=702.24s)]
*  even if it's the most blatant and ridiculous lie. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=708.0s)]
*  I mean, no, you're absolutely right. I remember during the polar vortex in Texas, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=710.4000000000001s)]
*  this is common in my mind because I lived through it. But for the rest of you guys, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  if you don't live here, in 2021, there was a big freeze that hit Texas and our electric grid froze [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  over. Everything was a disaster and Texans died because they froze to death in their homes. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=727.76s)]
*  While our surrounding states who were also hit with similar freezing temperatures, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=733.28s)]
*  they were just fine because of their electricity. But I remember our governor and Trump, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=737.76s)]
*  they were on the news talking about windmills. And they're like, it's the windmills fault. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  The windmills are faulty and that's why all this is happening. And also it's only affecting Texans. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=749.6s)]
*  And also there are windmills in Nordic countries that are doing just fine and are going through [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=755.52s)]
*  the winters and they're not causing people to freeze to death in their homes. But they said [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=761.44s)]
*  that and so many Republicans and people who are watching Fox News, they were just like, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=766.32s)]
*  it was the windmills. We gotta get rid of the windmills. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=770.48s)]
*  And that was a narrative that flowed all the way across Texas. And it was like an active [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=772.96s)]
*  effort on behalf of other people to be like that doesn't make any sense. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=779.12s)]
*  And if you just think about it for two seconds, you would know it doesn't make any sense. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-OuyWX1QY&t=783.6s)]
