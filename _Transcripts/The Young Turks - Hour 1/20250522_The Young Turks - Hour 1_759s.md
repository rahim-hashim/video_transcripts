"A group of foreign diplomats came under fire while visiting the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Authority. The diplomats were on an official mission to observe the humanitarian situation in Jenin when shots rang out. 

An aid worker, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisal, said a delegation of about 20 diplomats was being briefed about the situation in Jenin by the Palestinian Authority. The group of regional, European and Western diplomats were standing near the entrance of the Jenin refugee camp when they heard gunshots just before 2pm local time, said witnesses."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

*  situation in Jenin for themselves. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=77.1s)]
*  The warning shots have been met [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=80.22s)]
*  without rage and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=82.18s)]

*  And the continuation of illegal [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=105.62s)]
*  settlement construction continues [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=107.38000000000001s)]

*  Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=114.17999999999999s)]
*  Spain, and Uruguay, summon Israel's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=116.96s)]
*  ambassadors or said they would [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=119.74s)]
*  raise the issue directly. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=121.86s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Forces said [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=124.13999999999999s)]
*  the diplomatic convoy had strayed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=126.1s)]

*  entered a restricted zone, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=130.06s)]
*  prompting troops to fire warning [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  shots to steer the group away. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=134.18s)]
*  You couldn't maybe shout at [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  the diplomats and tell them, hey, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  you're not allowed to be here [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=139.94000000000003s)]
*  instead. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=141.26000000000002s)]
*  You got to shoot bullets at them? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=141.86s)]
*  This is a belligerent military, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  belligerent. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=147.38000000000002s)]
*  And the reason why they're [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=149.78s)]
*  belligerent is because they've been [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=151.02s)]
*  enabled by the United States [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=152.74s)]
*  government, which is the top [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=154.02s)]
*  military superpower in this world. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=155.58s)]
*  This is unacceptable. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=158.22000000000003s)]
*  Can you freaking imagine if [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=160.5s)]
*  American troops did this? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=162.34s)]
*  If American troops fired warning [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  shots at diplomats who were here on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=166.74s)]
*  US soil to do whatever they're here [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=169.82s)]
*  to do. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  But it's okay, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=173.54s)]
*  it's okay if the IDF does it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=174.54s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, guys, so [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=176.62s)]
*  this is beyond anything I've seen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=178.86s)]
*  So they're so used to being above [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=183.46s)]
*  the law, they're so used to getting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=185.94s)]
*  away with terrorism, but they're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=188.58s)]
*  like, we'll just shoot at foreign [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=190.9s)]
*  diplomats, it doesn't matter. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=192.7s)]
*  No one can hold us accountable. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=194.5s)]
*  And you know what, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=196.34s)]
*  we'll get their politicians to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=197.26s)]
*  give us more money, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=199.06s)]
*  because they're our dogs. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  They could have shot all of them [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=202.22s)]
*  dead, and all those countries would [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=203.54s)]
*  still send Israel more money. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=204.98s)]
*  They would, they would, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=206.22s)]
*  you're totally right about that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's why they feel they're [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=208.5s)]
*  acting like they're above the law. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=209.94s)]
*  They could do terrorism anytime [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=211.54s)]
*  they want. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=213.1s)]
*  So is it terrorism to shoot at [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=213.98s)]
*  diplomats? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=215.9s)]
*  Yes, it doesn't matter that you're [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  shooting above their heads. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=218.58s)]
*  By the way, bullets go places. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=219.58s)]
*  I remember in the old days, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=221.9s)]
*  the Palestinians would shoot guns [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  into the air and Israelis would [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=226.62s)]
*  say, wow, how stupid, the bullets [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=228.86s)]
*  come land back down to Earth. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=230.82000000000002s)]
*  Well, those bullets went somewhere, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=232.58s)]
*  they could have killed somebody, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=234.06s)]
*  right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=235.3s)]
*  But it doesn't matter because it's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  a refugee camp, all what it would [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=237.10000000000002s)]
*  done is kill Palestinians. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=238.3s)]
*  And the terrorists that are the IDF [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=239.38000000000002s)]
*  think it's no big deal to kill [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=241.06s)]
*  Palestinians, that's what they do [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsG_si8yYo&t=242.38000000000002s)]
