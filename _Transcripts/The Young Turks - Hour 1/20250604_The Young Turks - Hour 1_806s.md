"The Democrats trying to understand young American men know people are roasting their plan.
All that mocking just proves their point, they said: Democrats aren‚Äôt taking this disaffected and politically alienated voting bloc seriously enough."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Democrats Are SO Cooked
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0)
*  Last week we covered that pretty [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=0.0s)]
*  embarrassing story involving [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  the Democrats deciding to invest [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=4.34s)]
*  $20 million to figure out why the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=6.7s)]
*  party lost so much support among [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  men in America, especially young [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=11.48s)]
*  men. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  So the Speaking with American Men [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  or SAM project is actually starting [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=17.04s)]
*  to release some of its findings. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=19.62s)]
*  They have some initial findings, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=22.12s)]
*  believe it or not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=24.32s)]
*  So they got right to work and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=25.66s)]
*  their findings happen to be [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=27.34s)]
*  in my opinion, some of the most [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  obvious things in the world, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=30.9s)]
*  which really highlights the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=32.739999999999995s)]
*  significance of how out of touch [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=34.3s)]
*  Democrats are with ordinary people, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=36.3s)]
*  normal people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=38.58s)]
*  And this is the party, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=39.66s)]
*  this used to be the party of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=40.98s)]
*  the working class, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=42.54s)]
*  this used to be the party of FDR. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=43.62s)]
*  Now they can't figure out men, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=45.42s)]
*  which is amazing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  So let's get to the details. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=49.58s)]
*  So SAM promises investment to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=51.54s)]
*  SAM, and they're not going to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=53.9s)]
*  fail. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=56.7s)]
*  So SAM promises investment to study [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=57.2s)]
*  the syntax, that's it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  At that point, you already know [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=61.5s)]
*  they're going to fail. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  But I'll continue with what this is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=65.74000000000001s)]
*  all about, language and content [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  that gains attention and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=71.22s)]
*  virality in these spaces. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=73.30000000000001s)]
*  It recommends buying advertisements [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=75.7s)]
*  and video games, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=78.42s)]
*  among other things. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=79.78s)]
*  Above all, we must shift from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=81.66s)]
*  a moralizing tone it urges, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=83.46000000000001s)]
*  which is maybe the only thing I've [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=85.36s)]
*  read about this project that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=87.64s)]
*  I agree with. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=89.6s)]
*  I think the moralizing tone turns [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=91.0s)]
*  a lot of people off. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=92.8s)]
*  And so if you're the party of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=94.28s)]
*  scolders, you're going to drive [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=96.04s)]
*  people away from your party. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=98.0s)]
*  I think that's just common sense. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=99.72s)]
*  I don't think you need to spend [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=101.48s)]
*  $20 million to figure that out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=102.6s)]
*  Now let's break down just how bad [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=104.4s)]
*  the Democrats problem really is, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=106.12s)]
*  because in last year's presidential [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=108.0s)]
*  election, the gender gap leapt to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=110.12s)]
*  13 percentage points nationally. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=112.28s)]
*  Up from 9 percentage points in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=115.48s)]
*  2020, men's support for [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=117.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris dropped by 6 points, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=119.12s)]
*  winning just 42% of men, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=121.52s)]
*  the lowest on record in recent [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=123.4s)]
*  elections. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  Now Sam's national survey found [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=127.04s)]
*  that just 27% of young men viewed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=129.52s)]
*  the Democratic Party positively, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=132.16s)]
*  while 43% of them viewed [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=134.96s)]
*  the Republican Party favorably. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=136.8s)]
*  That gap became even more [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=139.6s)]
*  pronounced among 18 and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=141.52s)]
*  29 year olds. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=143.52s)]
*  Look, people get really mad when I [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=146.56s)]
*  say this, but you either want to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=148.08s)]
*  know what went wrong or you don't. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  And if you don't want to know, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=151.56s)]
*  if you want to live in magical [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  thinking land, then everything is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=154.56s)]
*  great and Democrats aren't making [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=156.4s)]
*  any mistake. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  Okay, stop listening right now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=159.36s)]
*  Okay, but for those of you who [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=160.8s)]
*  want the truth, Democrats can't [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=161.96s)]
*  stop telling men how much they hate [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  That's a problem, okay? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  Not every man is carrying out toxic [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  masculinity. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=172.08s)]
*  They're not acting as though, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=174.72s)]
*  not all of them certainly are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  acting as though they're entitled [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  to sex with any woman they want. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=180.36s)]
*  These stereotypes that lump all men [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=183.52s)]
*  together and make them out to be [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=186.08s)]
*  bad guys is not healthy, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=188.28s)]
*  it's not right and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  it's not good politics, obviously. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=191.36s)]
*  So I'm not surprised that men are [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=194.96s)]
*  like, yeah, Democratic Party, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=197.0s)]
*  I don't know if I like them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=199.28s)]
*  Because the Democratic Party keeps [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=200.76s)]
*  signaling that they don't like men, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  that's the issue. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=204.88s)]
*  So and by the way, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  let me just put it in the context [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=207.2s)]
*  of women. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=209.12s)]
*  Obviously, I'm a woman and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=211.28s)]
*  I love femininity, I love it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=213.32s)]
*  I'm like, I wish I was able to be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=215.64s)]
*  more feminine in my life, but [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=217.92s)]
*  I work in a very masculine field of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=220.16s)]
*  work, obviously. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=222.6s)]
*  And I just feel like I have a lot [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=224.48s)]
*  of male energy around me at all [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=226.04s)]
*  times, which is fine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't have a problem with that, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=228.48s)]
*  there aren't a lot of opportunities [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=230.2s)]
*  for me to feel as feminine as I [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=232.12s)]
*  want to feel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=233.8s)]
*  If the Democratic Party suddenly [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=234.88s)]
*  started talking about how toxic I [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=237.12s)]
*  am because of how much I identify [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=239.4s)]
*  with femininity. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=241.68s)]
*  In fact, I have a specific example. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=243.8s)]
*  I remember there was this super [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=245.4s)]
*  radlib student that I went to grad [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=248.8s)]
*  school with, his name was Bruce. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=252.04s)]
*  And he was a good guy, okay? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=254.28s)]
*  He met well. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=255.88s)]
*  But I remember one time I had to go [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=257.64s)]
*  to class after work at TYT and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=259.8s)]
*  I was wearing heels. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=261.96s)]
*  And he started chiding me for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  wearing heels. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=266.4s)]
*  He's like, you've been brainwashed [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=268.56s)]
*  by the patriarchy, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=269.96s)]
*  you don't like that, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=270.8s)]
*  you don't like wearing heels. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=271.68s)]
*  And I'm like, damn right I like [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  wearing heels, who the hell are you [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  to tell me I don't like wearing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=276.24s)]
*  heels? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  It was just incredibly insulting. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  So anytime I think about the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=280.64s)]
*  messaging coming from the Democratic [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=282.2s)]
*  Party and whether or not it's going [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=284.28s)]
*  to be effective, if they're focused [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=286.4s)]
*  on a specific demographic or [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  group of people, I try to turn [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  around and think about how it would [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  make me feel to be the target of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  that same messaging, okay? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=294.92s)]
*  So just think about that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=296.68s)]
*  Now, it is worth noting that 5% [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=299.0s)]
*  more conservatives than liberals [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=300.88s)]
*  responded to that survey. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  So the survey results, again, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=304.16s)]
*  had more conservatives included, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=305.88s)]
*  so the results might be a little [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=307.76s)]
*  skewed. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=309.32s)]
*  But now let's talk about how men [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=310.32s)]
*  feel about the Democratic Party. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  So Sam's first round of research [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=313.88s)]
*  was conducted of 30 focus groups [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  and a national media consumption [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=319.16s)]
*  survey. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  They found that many young men [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=323.0s)]
*  believe that neither party has our [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=324.88s)]
*  back, true, true, okay? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=327.12s)]
*  As one black man from Georgia said [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=329.0s)]
*  in a focus group, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=331.24s)]
*  participants described the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  Democratic Party as overly scripted [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=334.6s)]
*  and cautious, while Republicans are [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=337.36s)]
*  seen as confident and unafraid to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=340.36s)]
*  offend. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=343.04s)]
*  Now in an era of people always [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=343.64000000000004s)]
*  talking about their sensitivities [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=345.68s)]
*  and always talking about how [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=347.8s)]
*  offended they are, it gives rise to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=349.48s)]
*  a counterculture where you seek out [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=351.48s)]
*  people who don't give a damn about [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=353.68s)]
*  offending others. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=355.76s)]
*  So I think that's definitely part [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=357.16s)]
*  of this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=359.0s)]
*  Now Elise Hogue, who's the co-founder [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=359.52s)]
*  of Sam, stated, Democrats are seen [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=361.96s)]
*  as weak, whereas Republicans are [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=364.4s)]
*  seen as strong. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=366.56s)]
*  Young men also spoke of being [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=367.56s)]
*  invisible to the Democratic [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=369.64s)]
*  coalition. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=371.84s)]
*  And so you've got this weak problem [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=373.0s)]
*  and then you've got this, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=376.2s)]
*  I don't think they care about me [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=377.76s)]
*  problem, and I think the combination [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=379.68s)]
*  is kind of a killer. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  Elise, this is why they pay you [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=384.6s)]
*  the big bucks, girl. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=386.2s)]
*  You get it, you get it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  Now in the focus groups, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=389.64s)]
*  the young men stated that they felt [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  stressed. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=393.68s)]
*  I mean, I can totally relate to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=395.32s)]
*  that as a woman, but certainly in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=396.92s)]
*  a culture where, traditionally [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=398.72s)]
*  speaking, men have been thought of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=400.36s)]
*  as the breadwinners or whatever. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=402.16s)]
*  And in this economic situation [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=403.88s)]
*  that we're all dealing with, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=405.8s)]
*  there's a lot of stress. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  They feel ashamed and confused [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=409.52s)]
*  about how to be a man. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=412.12s)]
*  Maybe because they keep getting [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=415.04s)]
*  slapped around when they just want [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  to be themselves, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=420.64s)]
*  So they vented about conflicting [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=422.48s)]
*  cultural messages of masculinity [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=424.56s)]
*  that put them in a no-win situation [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=426.8s)]
*  around the meaning of a man, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=429.0s)]
*  according to the Sam Project memo. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=430.84s)]
*  Okay, so other issues included [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=434.12s)]
*  feeling isolated after the COVID [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=436.36s)]
*  lockdowns, which makes sense. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=438.88000000000005s)]
*  By the way, the COVID lockdowns, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=441.8s)]
*  I mean, we're still obviously [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=444.0s)]
*  experiencing the downsides of that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=446.04s)]
*  and the repercussions, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=448.32000000000005s)]
*  the consequences of that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=450.0s)]
*  So many community groups and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  ways in which people would connect [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=454.0s)]
*  with one another in person, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=456.36s)]
*  basically got shut down and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=458.24s)]
*  they never came back. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=460.12s)]
*  And so everyone needs a sense of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=462.32s)]
*  community, right? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=464.08s)]
*  I remember when my mom wasn't in [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  the hospital and I was able to go [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=467.12s)]
*  to dance class. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=468.48s)]
*  Going to those dance classes and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=469.44s)]
*  seeing the same people all the time [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=471.2s)]
*  and feeling closer to them with [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  each passing class that I took, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=474.76s)]
*  made me feel a sense of community. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=476.59999999999997s)]
*  It made me happier. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=478.4s)]
*  And when those things are kind of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=480.08s)]
*  taken away from you because of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  forced lockdowns or [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=483.08s)]
*  whatever other reason, yeah, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=484.08s)]
*  it's going to cause feelings [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  of loneliness. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=487.32s)]
*  It's going to cause other issues. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, for [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=490.24s)]
*  a lot of young men who might have [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=491.0s)]
*  just graduated college and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=492.56s)]
*  they're entering the job market for [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  the first time. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=495.68s)]
*  It's a terrible situation to find [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  yourself in when you graduate and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  there is no job market because [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=500.44s)]
*  there's nationwide shutdowns [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  of businesses. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=503.88s)]
*  And they're also upset about how [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=505.15999999999997s)]
*  they're unable to afford traditional [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  economic milestones like buying [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=510.12s)]
*  a house or paying for [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=512.36s)]
*  their kids' college. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=513.72s)]
*  And that is one of the most [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=515.12s)]
*  understandable things in the world [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=516.72s)]
*  because the whole point of growing [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=519.12s)]
*  older, doing the work, going to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=521.4s)]
*  school, working hard, whatever, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=523.44s)]
*  is you're working towards something. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=525.72s)]
*  You have something to look forward [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=528.12s)]
*  to and I think at this point, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=529.92s)]
*  not just men, by the way, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=531.44s)]
*  I think most Americans are feeling [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=532.84s)]
*  as though it doesn't even matter [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=534.8s)]
*  how hard I work, right? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=536.72s)]
*  It just feels like those milestones [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=538.16s)]
*  that used to come, I wouldn't say [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=541.16s)]
*  easy because obviously you have to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=543.76s)]
*  work hard to get these things done. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=546.56s)]
*  Even historically, but [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=548.92s)]
*  there was a path to getting those [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=550.4799999999999s)]
*  things. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=552.52s)]
*  Now it seems like there is no path [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=553.12s)]
*  and that leads to a lot of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=555.0s)]
*  frustration, a lot of anger. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  So when you have the Democrats in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  power and they're nickel and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  diming, they're tweaking around [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=562.12s)]
*  the edges policy wise, but [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=564.56s)]
*  it doesn't really change the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  material conditions American [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=568.28s)]
*  workers are experiencing. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=570.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's going to be backlash [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=572.4s)]
*  toward the Democratic Party, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=574.12s)]
*  especially when someone like [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=575.76s)]
*  President Biden comes in, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=577.4s)]
*  presents himself as someone who's [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=578.96s)]
*  going to save them, improve the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=580.96s)]
*  economy, and create a situation in [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  which they're going to be golden. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  They're going to do really well. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=586.2s)]
*  They're going to be able to buy [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=587.6800000000001s)]
*  that house. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=588.88s)]
*  They're going to be able to invest [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=589.4s)]
*  money in the stock market. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  Now obviously, Trump has been [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=591.8000000000001s)]
*  losing some support, especially [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=593.4s)]
*  among independent voters and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=595.08s)]
*  Latino voters who opted to support [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=596.72s)]
*  him because of his economic [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=598.64s)]
*  messaging, because guess what, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=600.24s)]
*  he hasn't delivered. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=602.12s)]
*  It's just the truth. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=603.32s)]
*  So now let's move on to some of [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  the other findings here. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=606.52s)]
*  John Della Volpe, another co-founder [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=608.16s)]
*  of SAM, and he's also a pollster [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=611.2s)]
*  who specializes in Gen Z stated, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=613.6s)]
*  the degree to which those economic [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=616.0s)]
*  concerns are also impacting how [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=618.44s)]
*  they think about themselves and [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=620.72s)]
*  quote unquote success of being [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=623.0s)]
*  a man and living up to their own [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=625.12s)]
*  expectations or the expectations of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=627.28s)]
*  their family or society. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=629.96s)]
*  There's another layer of economic [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=631.76s)]
*  anxiety, this is my favorite part. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  That I don't think I fully saw [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=637.44s)]
*  until now, you're a pollster? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=640.08s)]
*  What kind of polls were you doing? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=643.8000000000001s)]
*  You didn't realize that there is [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=645.96s)]
*  widespread economic frustration [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=648.36s)]
*  among pretty much everyone, but [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=651.0s)]
*  certainly among young men. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=653.4s)]
*  I just, I don't know if you're [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=656.2s)]
*  doing your job right, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=658.04s)]
*  if you just realized that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=659.24s)]
*  But anyway, the men in the focus [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=660.6800000000001s)]
*  group also spoke about how [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=662.2s)]
*  politicians, especially Kamala [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=663.44s)]
*  Harris and Donald Trump made them [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=665.08s)]
*  feel. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=666.84s)]
*  So vibes matter, okay? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=668.36s)]
*  I think the last election cycle was [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=670.1600000000001s)]
*  really a vibe based election. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=672.2s)]
*  And an Asian American professional [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=674.6s)]
*  described Democrats as embracing [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=676.76s)]
*  the fluid masculinity of being [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=678.88s)]
*  like empathetic and sensitive, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  while Republicans are more like [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  the traditional masculinity of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=684.76s)]
*  a provider strong and [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=686.76s)]
*  the machismo type. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I would have used [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  the word machismo, anyway, but [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=692.44s)]
*  continuing. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=694.0400000000001s)]
*  Another Latino man from Las Vegas [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=695.6s)]
*  said that during the 2024 campaign [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=697.88s)]
*  Harris focused on, I got Beyonce [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=700.4399999999999s)]
*  on stage with me, I got Lady Gaga [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=702.88s)]
*  on stage. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=705.3199999999999s)]
*  And it just kind of felt like, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=706.8s)]
*  what does that have to do with me? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=708.48s)]
*  I'm trying to move up in life. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=710.1999999999999s)]
*  That is shocking actually. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=713.76s)]
*  It is shocking to me that men [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=714.96s)]
*  weren't seduced by the lyrical [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=717.36s)]
*  talent of Beyonce. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=720.36s)]
*  How did that not work? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=722.64s)]
*  It's weird, it's crazy. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=723.92s)]
*  Look, overall, I'm happy that [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=726.5999999999999s)]
*  the Democratic Party at least [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=728.28s)]
*  wants to figure out what they're [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=729.92s)]
*  getting wrong. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=731.7199999999999s)]
*  But in the process of doing so, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  they're kind of showing us how out [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=734.9599999999999s)]
*  of touch they've been and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=736.9599999999999s)]
*  how much work they have to do. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=738.5999999999999s)]
*  Same guy says, Trump's over here, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=741.76s)]
*  if you're able to get a surplus in [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  our budget, then we're going to [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=745.8399999999999s)]
*  have no tax on tips, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=747.76s)]
*  no tax on overtime. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=749.04s)]
*  It's going to take a while to get [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=751.12s)]
*  to that point, but at least he's [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  saying the things that, this is [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=755.24s)]
*  what I'm going to do, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=757.48s)]
*  the Latino man added. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=758.8s)]
*  Remember when you guys got mad at [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=762.04s)]
*  me when I kept mentioning how [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=763.8s)]
*  Trump repeating that he's going to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=765.4s)]
*  do no tax on tips was like [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=767.4s)]
*  effective political messaging and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=768.8s)]
*  it's going to work? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=771.0s)]
*  It worked, okay, it worked. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=773.6s)]
*  I don't say these things because [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to kiss Trump's ass. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=777.6s)]
*  I say these things because my job [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=779.28s)]
*  is to do analysis. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  And I see things pretty clear, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  like the last election cycle, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=784.54s)]
*  I saw things real clearly, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=785.8s)]
*  which is why election night, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=786.88s)]
*  I wasn't panicking, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=788.16s)]
*  I didn't freak out because I saw [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=789.16s)]
*  that iceberg coming. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=790.6s)]
*  The question is, why didn't [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=792.0s)]
*  the Democrats see that iceberg [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=793.48s)]
*  coming and will they see it in [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=795.04s)]
*  the future? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=796.56s)]
*  Who knows, we're going to have to [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=797.6s)]
*  wait and see. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=798.64s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=799.56s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=801.12s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbfkjWAPg0&t=802.68s)]
