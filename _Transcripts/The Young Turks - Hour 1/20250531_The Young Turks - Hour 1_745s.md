"A Fire Aid Benefit Concert held on January 30, 2025, raised an estimated $100 million to support residents of Pacific Palisades and Eaton who lost homes in the January fires. However, many affected residents are questioning where the funds have gone, as they struggle to find information on how to apply for assistance.
According to OPB, organizations such as El Nido, Home Grown, Vision y Compromiso, and L.A.'s Home for Native People received grants from the Fire Aid funds. Despite this, some residents feel left behind, particularly those living in rent-controlled apartments or mobile home parks who have not received aid."

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Victims Say L.A. Fires Fundraiser Proceeds Are NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg)
*  Last January, tens of thousands of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=0.0s)]
*  Los Angeles area residents lost [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=2.52s)]
*  their homes in two major fires, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=4.88s)]
*  the Eaton Fire and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  the Pacific Palisades Fire. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=8.56s)]
*  Now in response, the fire aid [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=10.74s)]
*  benefit concerts raised $100 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  million in order to help out [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=17.12s)]
*  Angelenos who lost their homes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=19.82s)]
*  I mean, we have a housing crisis. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=23.84s)]
*  It's really bad in Los Angeles. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=25.86s)]
*  There isn't enough housing to put [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=28.5s)]
*  everyone in a place to live. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=30.54s)]
*  And so this money was desperately [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=32.86s)]
*  needed $100 million, wow. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=34.66s)]
*  But several months later, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  many fire victims are now wondering, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=38.84s)]
*  yeah, so what happened to that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=41.42s)]
*  money because no one helped us out [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=43.4s)]
*  at all? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=45.58s)]
*  Now some organizations, some [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=46.82s)]
*  nonprofits did receive grants from [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=49.18s)]
*  the fire aid fund. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=51.74s)]
*  So El Nido is one of them, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  Homegrown is another, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=55.08s)]
*  Vision y Comprisimo is another one, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=57.36000000000001s)]
*  and then there's LA's Home for [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=60.28s)]
*  Native People. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=62.84s)]
*  Those are specific nonprofits that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=65.68s)]
*  receive some grants. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=67.88000000000001s)]
*  But many residents impacted by [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  the fires and especially those who [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=71.08s)]
*  were living in rent controlled [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=73.18s)]
*  apartment units want to know why [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  they didn't get any help. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  Why the fire aid fund didn't in any [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=79.16s)]
*  way go toward them and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=82.04s)]
*  helping their situation out. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=83.78s)]
*  And look, they've been reaching out [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=87.16s)]
*  to the administrators, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=89.06s)]
*  the people behind this fundraising [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=90.36s)]
*  effort to get some answers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=92.12s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  They are evading the questions and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=94.68s)]
*  they won't give any clear answers [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  on how they decide to allocate [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=98.92s)]
*  funds or where any of the funds [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=100.76s)]
*  were allocated to. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=102.64s)]
*  And the problem is that nonprofits [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=104.36s)]
*  don't have the same standards or [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=106.68s)]
*  reporting requirements that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=108.92s)]
*  government agencies do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=111.04s)]
*  So there's been a lot of grifting [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  happening, especially in a state [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=115.27999999999999s)]
*  like California, where NGOs have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=117.24s)]
*  basically run amok. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=119.28s)]
*  And I want to dig a little deeper [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=121.28s)]
*  into this particular fundraising [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=123.24s)]
*  effort to figure out what's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=125.36s)]
*  going on here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  Now remember that fire aid raised [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  $100 million, yet this is what [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=130.76s)]
*  the Annenberg Foundation [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=133.16s)]
*  brags about on its site. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=135.2s)]
*  The Annenberg Foundation, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=137.2s)]
*  by the way, is basically the group [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=139.04s)]
*  that takes the money and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=141.28s)]
*  makes the allocation decisions. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=143.02s)]
*  They're the ones who [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=145.54s)]
*  write the grants, okay? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=146.18s)]
*  So keep that in mind, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=147.1s)]
*  you're going to want to know that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=148.02s)]
*  as we get deeper into this story. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  So the Annenberg Foundation fire [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=151.74s)]
*  relief grants to nonprofits in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=153.5s)]
*  Los Angeles, they write about it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=155.26s)]
*  in their website. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  And they raised $100 million, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=158.78s)]
*  get a load of this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=160.38s)]
*  Since the fires began on January [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  7th, the Annenberg Foundation led [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=163.74s)]
*  by Chair Wallace Annenberg and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=166.38s)]
*  its directors with the Foundation's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  community grantmaking team has [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=171.34s)]
*  committed and begun to pay, wow, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=173.54s)]
*  3.175 million to more than 50 [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=176.18s)]
*  nonprofit community partners. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  Okay, what happened to the rest of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=183.22s)]
*  the money? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=184.14s)]
*  And more importantly, what are [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=184.66s)]
*  those other nonprofits that got [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=186.62s)]
*  the grants up to? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  What did they do to actually help [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=190.1s)]
*  the fire victims? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=191.7s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=193.54s)]
*  Reporter James Lee, who's also a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=195.38s)]
*  contributor for Breaking Points, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=197.1s)]
*  decided to dig in himself. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=198.9s)]
*  And here's what he found. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=200.22s)]
*  All direct donations will be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=203.1s)]
*  distributed under the advisement of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=204.78s)]
*  the Annenberg Foundation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=207.06s)]
*  According to the IRS 990 form, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  the Annenberg Foundation is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=210.54s)]
*  a 501C3 based in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=212.3s)]
*  Conchakin, Pennsylvania, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=213.34s)]
*  in this lovely office building. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=215.18s)]
*  One massive red flag right away is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=217.26s)]
*  that only 33% of their annual [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=219.34s)]
*  expenses goes towards actual [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=221.34s)]
*  charity programs. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=223.3s)]
*  The rest goes to administrative [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=225.46s)]
*  costs like executive compensation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=227.22s)]
*  And if you look at the numbers, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=229.42s)]
*  they treat you pretty good over [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=230.57999999999998s)]

*  There's this thing that people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=255.66000000000003s)]

*  people who went to college, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=261.98s)]

*  maybe they got their PhD. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=267.62s)]
*  They then graduate, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  they look at the job market and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=270.66s)]
*  they're like, wow, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=272.62s)]
*  my education was worthless. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=273.90000000000003s)]

*  NGOs or they go to the office and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=280.22s)]

*  NGO and a lot of those NGOs, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=286.34s)]
*  big racket, huge. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=288.46s)]
*  I believe it is my opinion that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=291.82s)]
*  the Annenberg Foundation is a good [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=293.78s)]
*  example of what I'm talking about. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=296.09999999999997s)]
*  So let's dig in a little deeper, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  because he's right, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=300.17999999999995s)]
*  the key executives and employees, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=301.62s)]
*  the key employees do get paid [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=303.94s)]
*  handsomely at this foundation. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=305.82s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=308.09999999999997s)]
*  So this was what he was showing in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  the video. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=311.46s)]
*  Yes, Cynthia Kennard, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  she's the top dog apparently. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=314.74s)]
*  Her compensation is $735,612 a year. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=316.82s)]
*  And then on top of that, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=321.18s)]
*  she gets a $135,000 more than [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=322.94s)]
*  $135,000 in bonus, okay? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=325.18s)]
*  Second, you have Alison Holmes, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=327.46s)]
*  senior director of operations and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  strategy, $359,053 for compensation. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=332.94s)]
*  And then nearly $90,000 for bonus, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=337.3s)]
*  that was Alison Holmes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=341.58s)]
*  Then you have Paul Manganiello, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=343.74s)]
*  he's the treasurer, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=346.58s)]
*  $333,455 for a salary. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=348.82s)]
*  You get the point. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=352.46s)]
*  You can see how the bulk of their [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=353.42s)]
*  money tends to go toward administrators, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=356.26s)]
*  the cost of operating. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=360.26s)]
*  The foundation also spent nearly [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=363.26s)]
*  $1.2 million on travel conferences [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=365.66s)]
*  and meetings in 2023. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  That was the last year that we have [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=370.3s)]
*  tax filings for them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=372.26s)]
*  They also gave the Philadelphia [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=373.74s)]
*  Orchestra Association $2.7 million [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=376.7s)]
*  in 2023, which was interesting. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=380.42s)]
*  Because if you look at their tax [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=383.7s)]
*  filing, you'll notice that a lot of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=385.38s)]
*  these grants for things like social [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=387.38s)]
*  justice programs, they mostly [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=389.54s)]
*  amounted to like $25,000. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=391.7s)]
*  But then certain things like what [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=393.78000000000003s)]
*  you're seeing on your screen right [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=395.86s)]
*  now really, really stood out to me. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=397.94s)]
*  So basically the Annenberg [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=400.86s)]
*  Foundation spending in 2023, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=403.22s)]
*  a massive portion of it went to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=406.06s)]
*  something called the Wallace [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=408.7s)]
*  Annenberg Legacy Foundation. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=411.46000000000004s)]
*  Now, Wallace Annenberg is the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=414.78000000000003s)]
*  chairman of the board for [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=417.22s)]
*  the Annenberg Foundation, also [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=419.3s)]
*  the president and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=422.02s)]
*  CEO of the Annenberg Foundation. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=423.42s)]
*  She also happens to have all these [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=426.22s)]
*  other nonprofits. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=428.26s)]
*  And so the Annenberg Foundation [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=429.42s)]
*  raises money and they write grants. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=431.94s)]
*  It's just that the bulk of their [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=435.74s)]
*  grants they write to themselves, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=437.94s)]
*  sort of, because Wallace has all [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  these other nonprofits that this [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=442.66s)]
*  nonprofit funnels the money to. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=444.74s)]
*  So let's take a look at that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=446.5s)]
*  graphic again, because you'll see [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=447.78000000000003s)]
*  all of the different grants. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=449.54s)]
*  This is all in one year, by the way. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=451.18s)]
*  This is all in 2023, okay? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  So there were four grants to the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=455.1s)]
*  tune of $1,975,000. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=457.70000000000005s)]
*  Then there was another grant to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=460.1s)]
*  the tune of $150 million. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=462.86s)]
*  That was funneled to the Wallace [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=465.82000000000005s)]
*  Annenberg Legacy Foundation. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=468.42s)]
*  Interesting, okay. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=471.06s)]
*  And then another $1,137,950 went [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=472.1s)]
*  to the Wallace Annenberg Legacy [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=474.98s)]
*  Foundation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=477.38s)]

*  went to Wallace's own nonprofit [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=481.14000000000004s)]

*  the Performing Arts, okay? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=501.58000000000004s)]
*  In sum, the Annenberg Foundation [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=503.02000000000004s)]
*  funneled nearly $159 million to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=505.82000000000005s)]

*  So I explored the Wallace Annenberg [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=515.3000000000001s)]
*  Legacy Foundation's tax filings and [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=517.5s)]
*  get a load of this, okay? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=519.78s)]
*  because I was curious. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=521.9s)]
*  Wow, look at that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=523.3000000000001s)]
*  In 2023, the year that this [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=524.14s)]

*  money, okay, $159 million. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=568.9000000000001s)]
*  And they only had $159 million [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=571.0200000000001s)]
*  and they only spend $15 million in [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=573.46s)]
*  expenses that year. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=575.9s)]
*  Now getting back to the fire aid [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=577.74s)]
*  and the money that was raised [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=579.42s)]
*  specifically for victims of those [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=580.98s)]
*  devastating fires. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=582.98s)]
*  Let's see where the Annenberg [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=584.54s)]
*  Foundation is providing some of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=585.9s)]
*  these grants because they are [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=587.46s)]
*  providing some other grants, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=588.9399999999999s)]
*  to be fair. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=590.46s)]
*  And our buddy looked into it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=591.54s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=593.1s)]
*  Local journalists have also been [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=595.34s)]
*  asking where's the money? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=596.82s)]
*  They found quote, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=598.14s)]
*  the fire aid website names only [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=599.1s)]
*  three palisades organizations that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=600.78s)]
*  receive grants. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=602.7s)]
*  Among almost 120 organizations [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=603.7800000000001s)]
*  listed as receiving grants, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=605.74s)]
*  none of whom are specific to [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=607.4200000000001s)]
*  Pacific Palisades. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=608.94s)]
*  And those three are Kahelet Israel, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=610.38s)]
*  Havad of Pacific Palisades, and [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=612.5s)]
*  Palisades Charter High School. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=614.5s)]
*  Others have tried to directly [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=616.5400000000001s)]
*  reach out to the Annenberg [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=617.74s)]
*  Foundation. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=618.82s)]
*  They were kind of given the run [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=619.5400000000001s)]
*  around, various extension numbers. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=620.86s)]
*  Somebody saying they would call [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=623.0200000000001s)]
*  them back, no one called back. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=624.22s)]
*  Also referring them to some [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=625.5s)]
*  mysterious man named Philip, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=627.0200000000001s)]
*  no last name, he was never found. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=628.7800000000001s)]
*  This is just crazy. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=631.5s)]
*  So essentially what they're doing [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=632.82s)]
*  is taking the $100 million, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=634.82s)]
*  then paying themselves roughly 70% [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=636.6600000000001s)]
*  of it, and then the rest of the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=638.82s)]
*  money they're dishing out to [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=640.58s)]
*  various other nonprofits with their [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=642.14s)]
*  own administrative expenses. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=644.34s)]
*  And that's how $100 million just [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=646.1800000000001s)]
*  ends up disappearing. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=648.14s)]
*  This is how $24 billion in [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=651.82s)]
*  taxpayer money in the state of [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=653.7800000000001s)]
*  California was allegedly allocated [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=656.1s)]
*  to help the homeless, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=658.86s)]
*  but homelessness has exploded [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=660.46s)]
*  since we spent that money. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=662.7s)]
*  And that money is unaccounted for [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=664.62s)]
*  because it was funneled to all of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=666.7s)]
*  these grifting nonprofits that have [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=668.62s)]
*  no interest in solving a damn [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=670.86s)]
*  thing. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=672.7s)]
*  There are a bunch of people who [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=673.22s)]
*  went to college, got their fancy [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=675.1s)]
*  degrees, can't find a job, so [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=677.0600000000001s)]
*  they end up working for [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=678.9000000000001s)]
*  NGOs and nonprofits. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=680.46s)]
*  And they still want to be rich. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=682.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, they did the hard work, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=683.94s)]
*  they got the education. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=685.6600000000001s)]
*  It's just that they want to be rich [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=687.0600000000001s)]
*  based off of money that's been [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=688.9399999999999s)]
*  fundraised for legitimate purposes. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=690.9399999999999s)]
*  And they want to get rich off of, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=693.42s)]
*  in a lot of cases, taxpayer money [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=695.62s)]
*  as well, because these nonprofits [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=697.9399999999999s)]
*  get grants from both the federal [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=700.3s)]
*  government and also state and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=702.4599999999999s)]
*  local government. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=704.5s)]
*  And if we're going to do that, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=706.18s)]
*  I think there needs to be a lot [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=708.02s)]
*  more oversight and reporting. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=709.9s)]
*  And when it turns out that the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=711.98s)]
*  money's unaccounted for, people [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=713.74s)]
*  should be prosecuted for that. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=715.9399999999999s)]
*  Because they're stealing from us. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=717.98s)]
*  I mean, I get that some people get [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=722.0200000000001s)]
*  real touchy about this, because I'm [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=724.3000000000001s)]
*  talking about the state of [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=726.7s)]
*  California, I'm talking about [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=728.22s)]
*  a state that's completely [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  controlled by Democrats. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=731.7800000000001s)]
*  But guess what, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=733.58s)]
*  Democrats be thieving too. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=734.46s)]
*  And it's about time we wake up to [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=735.9000000000001s)]
*  that reality. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDfy2jXm9Yg&t=737.2600000000001s)]
