"A senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official testified in federal court on Wednesday that his office had used opaque pro-Israel blacklisting websites to help target international student activists for investigation and possible deportation.
The admission by Peter Hatch, the assistant director of the Homeland Security Investigations department within ICE, appeared to be the first time that an administration official had acknowledged taking cues from the shadowy groups behind the sites, including Canary Mission, which has been accused of doxxing individuals engaged in pro-Palestinian activism."

# Official Makes DISTURBING ADMISSION About Targeting Student Activists
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY)
*  A senior Homeland Security official admitted in court yesterday what we already suspected, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=0.0s)]
*  that his department had relied on shadowy pro-Israel groups to target [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=6.72s)]
*  foreign students who participated in pro-Palestinian activism. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=11.68s)]
*  The admission came from Peter Hatch, the Assistant Director of Homeland [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=16.56s)]
*  Security Investigations Department within ICE. Cenk, they're relying on groups that we've known [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=21.04s)]
*  about as shadowy and targeting these kids for years. And now they're influencing government [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=27.84s)]
*  operations. This is a scary development. What do you think? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=33.92s)]
*  So first of all, this is an anonymous group. We don't even know if it's being run out of Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=36.8s)]
*  And it is definitely on behalf of a foreign government, Israel. And as you'll see in the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=41.36s)]
*  story, the whole idea of anti-Semitism is just a ruse. They're tracking anyone who criticized [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=46.0s)]
*  Israel. In fact, if they consider you pro-Palestinian, you'll be put on a list [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  that the American government is now using to kidnap people and take away their rights. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=58.56s)]
*  So this is as bad as anyone imagined. And it turns out these groups have been operating in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  America since the 1980s, making lists of students and professors who they considered to be too [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=69.76s)]
*  pro-Palestinian and trying to ruin their lives, including make sure they never get a job again [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=75.2s)]
*  in America if they dare to criticize Israel. So there's something terrible and nefarious going [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=80.32s)]
*  out in this country. And it's definitely coming from Israel. I mean, here's the overwhelming [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=86.88s)]
*  proof you're about to see, including in court hearings that just happened. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=92.8s)]
*  Right. Well, Hatch was testifying during the third day of trial proceedings in a case brought by [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=96.8s)]
*  academic associations against the Trump administration for their efforts to deport [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  foreign students like Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeija Ozturk. The academic groups called Hatch as a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=109.84s)]
*  witness and he delivered. The judge asked him, many of the names of the student protesters provided [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=116.08s)]
*  to you for the Office of Intelligence to produce reports of analysis on came from the website [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=122.56s)]
*  Canary Mission, referring to an anonymously run group that doxes people, let's be clear, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=129.76s)]
*  and who have engaged in pro-Palestinian activism on their online database. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=135.92s)]
*  Hatch responded, it's true. Many of the names or even most of the names came from that website, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=141.76s)]
*  but we were getting names and leads from many different sources. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=147.44s)]
*  The other sources included Batar, another pro-Israel group. In total, he had a list of over 5,000 names [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=150.96s)]
*  to investigate. In March, Hatch testified he formed a Tiger Team or a specialized [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=160.08s)]
*  task force to respond to abrupt orders that he rushed analysis on thousands of people [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  whose names and identities had been published by Canary Mission. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  Hatch testified that after the team's review, between 100 and 200 reports on non-citizen [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=179.12s)]
*  protesters were submitted to the State Department, which would determine whether to detain them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=186.48s)]
*  He claimed that the government doesn't have any formal relationship with Canary Mission [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  and doesn't even know who runs the website. Nonetheless, one of the likely victims of this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=197.28s)]
*  informal collaboration was Rumeija Ozturk, the Tufts student who was abducted by federal [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=202.56s)]
*  agents for writing an op-ed critical of Israel. Canary Mission had identified her on their website, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=208.64s)]
*  accusing her of anti-Semitism and anti-Israel activism. When Ozturk was detained, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=215.92s)]
*  Canary Mission claimed credit, asserting that her profile was the primary cause of her arrest. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=222.48s)]
*  A Department of Homeland Security memo justifying her detention [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  reportedly used language nearly identical to that of her Canary Mission page. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=232.72s)]
*  Like Canary Mission, DHS cited her op-ed. Cenk, the fact that shadowy anonymous doxing websites [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=238.56s)]
*  are now providing lists to DHS for potential deportations, it's a dark new day in America. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=248.16s)]
*  Yeah, so these type of websites have been around since 1983. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=256.4s)]
*  So there's a guy who was an NYU professor, Zachary Lockman. He got listed on one of these sites back [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  in the 1980s. And they provided college guides, meaning for professors to never hire because [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=269.52s)]
*  they criticized Israel in one way, shape or form. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=282.64s)]
*  And by the way, it didn't have to be, first of all, none of it had anything to do with anti-Semitism. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=287.28s)]
*  It was just either criticism of Israel or anything that was considered pro-Palestinian. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=292.0s)]
*  And so they would put people on a list. Now, how do you say it doesn't have to do with anti-Semitism? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=298.0s)]
*  There was Jewish professors on the list. And Noam Chomsky was on the list, right? So it didn't [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=301.2s)]
*  matter at all if you were Jewish, not Jewish. The only thing that mattered is, will you bow your head [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  to Israel? In fact, Mother Jones has a terrific story about this. You should read it in its entirety [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=310.4s)]
*  because it's shocking. It's amazing. They would say, okay, to the outside world, they say this is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=317.76s)]
*  anti-discrimination, right? But they then put pressure on the universities, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=323.44s)]
*  do not admit any Arab students. Because if you admit Arab students, they have anti-Israel positions, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  and that's unacceptable. Don't let any Arabs into the country. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=336.48s)]
*  They're supposed to be fighting discrimination. No, they were literally perpetuating discrimination. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=341.36s)]
*  And in this latest version of it, and Canary starts in 2014, the Canary mission does, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=347.12s)]
*  they start putting up the pictures. I mean, you want to talk about doxing and the address [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  and everything about the people going. And by the way, they say in that, on the website too, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  making sure that we're basically ruining the job prospects of any of these people. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=364.32s)]
*  This is before, and remember, it starts in 2014. Before 2023, before all this, they got more and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=370.48s)]
*  more brazen before they basically captured the entire US government to the Trump administration [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=377.28s)]
*  and said, yeah, anyone you want to arrest on behalf of Israel, America's here to serve you [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  loyally, right? But back then, they were mainly trying to make sure that they would ruin your [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=386.32s)]
*  life and that no one would ever hire you for criticize Israel. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=391.6s)]
*  So when it comes to Ozturk and the others, well, what got you on the list for Canary [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=395.12s)]
*  mission these days? Mother Jones explains, attending an anti-war protest, for example, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=400.8s)]
*  becomes quote, participation in a pro-Hamas rally. And criticism of Israeli policies is framed as [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=406.0s)]
*  quote, demonizing Israel. So that gets you on the list. And as Jordan just explained to you, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  the US government took their list directly. And by the way, saying throughout the court proceedings, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=420.72s)]
*  I wouldn't have time to look into this. We assembled a tiger team to look through it [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=426.48s)]
*  quickly. But basically, if these guys say that we should eliminate them on behalf of Israel [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=431.12s)]
*  from existing in this country and get deported them, arrest them, etc. That's it, we're just [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=435.44000000000005s)]
*  gonna do it. We're gonna do it. And who are these people? I don't know, they're anonymous. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  They could be Israelis, they could be government agents of Israel, or they could just be some [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  people inside the country who are like, no, I love Israel. And if it means destroying America's [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=449.68s)]
*  constitution and freedom of speech and discriminating against all Arabs and Muslims. Yeah, of course, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=455.12s)]
*  of course, on behalf of Israel, we must do all this. Now it's in court. Now it's in court, US [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=462.0s)]
*  government officials saying, yes, we took their list and arrested people based on it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=467.52s)]
*  So don't tell me that Israel doesn't have unbelievable epic record breaking influence [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=473.2s)]
*  in America. The only way to say that is if you're a full fledged liar, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=481.52s)]
*  and you just say, I don't care, I find it offensive. How dare you? Did you go to a peace protest? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=487.12s)]
*  If you want to appease, I don't care if you're Jewish, I don't care if you're a Holocaust [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=494.32s)]
*  survivor, I don't care about anything. You go to a peace protest, you're a pro-Palestinian, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=497.44s)]
*  the worst thing you could be. And you see how I'm against discrimination? No, you're not. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=502.4s)]
*  No, all of this is a massive discrimination. And not just against Arabs and Muslims, but against [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=506.48s)]
*  people who are trying to stop a genocide of all races and religions. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=513.36s)]
*  And yes, Americans, Americans go on these lists. They just happen to take the guys who are legally [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=517.2s)]
*  here but not citizens first, okay? And I guess we're next for all the US citizens because, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=524.88s)]
*  God help you, if you cross Israel, you're gonna go on the list and they're gonna try to ruin your life. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=532.4s)]
*  Yeah, I wanna be clear about, they're talking about Rameshia Ozterk who wrote an op-ed and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=536.64s)]
*  while they say it's anti-Semitic and anti-Israel activism, you could read the op-ed for yourself, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=543.92s)]
*  and I have, and I would encourage people to check it out just so you see how fast and loose [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=549.28s)]
*  they're playing with these terms. While in the first paragraph, it briefly summarizes [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  what Israel is doing in Gaza, links to validation and sources backing up her claims, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=562.48s)]
*  the Guardian, Amnesty International, and the International Court of Justice. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=571.52s)]
*  It then goes on for the remainder of the op-ed to call on Tufts University to divest from Israel. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=576.08s)]
*  That's what they're saying is anti-Semitic, doesn't say anything about Jewish people. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=583.76s)]
*  And I wanna be clear, those are two separate things. Israel is an ethno-state, they are [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=586.96s)]
*  an apartheid state and it is a home for Jewish people. That's not one in the same. It's not [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitism to criticize Israel and the Israeli government's actions. She's calling on Tufts [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=597.76s)]
*  University to divest from Israel and Israeli companies. That's, in my mind, totally fun. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=603.2s)]
*  That is a peaceful form of protest. That is a peaceful form of activism. But they have fought [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  so hard to limit and demonize any attempts at activism or advocacy around this issue, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=618.4000000000001s)]
*  as we've shown and talked about for years, even boycotting, divestment and sanctions in some [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=624.96s)]
*  states is now illegal. Where's the love of free speech that we hear so much about? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=630.24s)]
*  Nobody cares. And now if you even talk about it, if you write an op-ed, quintessential free [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=636.56s)]
*  expression in this country. If you call for a boycott or a divestment in an op-ed, that gets [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=642.64s)]
*  you put on a list and the government's going to arrest you. It is horrifying stuff, Cenk. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=649.36s)]
*  All right, I'm going to tell you three more amazing facts. So back in the 2000s, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=653.76s)]
*  there was a very similar group called Masada 2000. And they created a list of what they [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=658.32s)]
*  considered quote self-hating and or Israel threatening Jew. And by the way, if you spell [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=665.2s)]
*  that is out, it's S-H-I-T Jew, okay? And so they compiled a list of over 8,000 Jewish Americans [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=672.4s)]
*  who are not sufficiently loyal to Israel. Okay, what is this? I mean, this is, so I mean, that is [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=682.88s)]
*  picture perfect proof that all of these groups since the 1980s have nothing to do with anti-Semitism. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=690.32s)]
*  In fact, they actively target Jewish professors and Jewish students if they think that they are [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=697.76s)]
*  not sufficiently loyal to a different country. They're like, how dare you be loyal to America? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=703.84s)]
*  How dare you be fair and honest? That's it. Put the Jews on the list. Are you insane? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=709.6s)]
*  Are you insane? And this is a pro-Israel group doing this. And then you find out that guess [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=714.64s)]
*  who wrote this giant report targeting about 117 professors and university staff members and students [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=720.64s)]
*  back in 2001. It was called Defending Civilization, How Our Universities Are Failing America [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=729.6s)]
*  and what could be done about it. So how did the professors and students get on that list? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=737.36s)]
*  If they opposed to any of our wars. And the person who wrote it was Lynn Cheney, Dick Cheney's wife, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=741.84s)]
*  who at the time was Secretary of Defense and in the middle of trying to start a war in Afghanistan [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=748.72s)]
*  and Iraq. So same old trick, go to the universities. If anyone dares oppose Israel's wars, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  that's it, they get put on a blacklist, right? And if you're thinking again, if you're right wing [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=762.4s)]
*  and you're like, look, I don't like any of this, but it's okay, I'm an American citizen. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=766.8s)]
*  It's not gonna affect me. They can't deport me. Well, first of all, sometimes they do, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=770.88s)]
*  okay? Sometimes they do arrest the wrong people, etc. But hold, it's not just about that. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=775.1999999999999s)]
*  So on Canary Mission's website, it says about the people that they have targeted, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=779.92s)]
*  American or otherwise. It is to quote, ensure that today's radicals are not tomorrow's employees. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=784.7199999999999s)]
*  So you wanna talk about cancel culture. Since the 1980s, Israel has been running a cancel culture [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=792.72s)]
*  program in America for anyone who dares oppose Israel, even in the slightest. And it doesn't [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=800.1600000000001s)]
*  matter if you're Muslim, Christian or Jewish, they're gonna target you and try to ruin you [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=807.2s)]
*  on behalf of a foreign government. And so now that the US has confirmed in a court proceeding [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  that yes, we're basically following this anonymous groups orders to eliminate Israel's enemies [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=820.48s)]
*  inside America. Are we gonna get to find out who's running it anonymously? Or is it okay? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=825.6s)]
*  And can Qatar then set up a website like this in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia and whoever else? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=832.1600000000001s)]
*  And or by the way, just random companies, oil companies, etc. And just smear people in any way, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=839.0400000000001s)]
*  call them racist, call them this, call them that, right? It's okay, you're gonna ruin your [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=846.08s)]
*  chance of getting employed or doing anything positive. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=852.0s)]
*  Don't tell me that we're not being influenced in a massive, massive way from Israel. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=856.1600000000001s)]
*  It has nothing to do with anti-Semitism. It definitely is the opposite of protecting [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=864.1600000000001s)]
*  against discrimination. It is incredibly in favor of discrimination. So I'm done with all the massive [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=869.2s)]
*  propaganda. And yes, mainly by mainstream media, that if you ever question Israel, that's it, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=877.2800000000001s)]
*  put them on a list. Okay, yeah, he said my ruinous life, ruinous life, get them off there, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  get them off there, not allowed. Yeah, I mean, in a lot of ways, CNN might as well be canary mission. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=887.36s)]
*  Who are they kidding? This has been my life the entire time that I've been in the US. If [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=892.96s)]
*  you ever question Israel, the world comes crashing down on you. Because it turns out [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=897.44s)]
*  there's a giant infrastructure meant to destroy anyone who opposes Israel in America. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=901.84s)]
*  But we can't find out who it is, cuz they're all anonymous. These guys are anonymous, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=907.44s)]
*  Apex donors are anonymous, everybody's anonymous, but they get to buy our government, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  they get to buy our politicians. And here, Trump has put up a for sale sign, go, yeah, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=916.1600000000001s)]
*  I'll take canary missions. List, who cares? And I'll eliminate anybody that's an enemy [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=921.0400000000001s)]
*  or critic of Israel, or even pro-Palestinian, or even went to a peace protest. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxAtexhOxMY&t=926.56s)]
