# The Most Unadulterated Bribery Of A President You Have Ever Seen
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo)
*  There's two reasons why this is the worst bribes I've ever seen in American history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=0.0s)]
*  And that is saying a lot given how we've institutionalized and legalized bribery in this country. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=6.32s)]
*  And let's note the great irony of this brother running a campaign on drain the swamp, please. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=11.96s)]
*  220 winners of a contest to meet President Trump, the top holders of his crypto coin. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=17.6s)]
*  I don't know much about it other than I launched it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=23.6s)]
*  I heard it was very successful. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=25.76s)]
*  NBC News has learned each dinner guest paid between $55,000 and $37.7 million for the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=27.48s)]
*  Trump coin. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=34.04s)]
*  Donald Trump's dinner is an orgy of corruption. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=35.04s)]
*  So that got even grosser than it already seemed with the orgy of corruption, but she's Elizabeth [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=44.92s)]
*  Warren is not wrong. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=49.6s)]
*  This is one of the most corrupt things I can think of in terms of the presidency. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=50.82s)]
*  Anything following up the $400 million plane is gonna seem slightly smaller by comparison. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=55.8s)]
*  But Donald Trump did bring over 200 of those who've given him the most money for his cryptocurrency. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=60.48s)]
*  It's handed him money, they got nothing in return. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=66.96s)]
*  And because most Americans don't have any investments, these 220 are the elite of the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=69.84s)]
*  elites. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=75.96s)]
*  And they got to do this dinner with Trump. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=77.44s)]
*  Now there was an elite of the elite elites. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=79.0s)]
*  The top 25 had an ultra exclusive private VIP reception from him. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=81.28s)]
*  You can see a little photo promoting that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=86.52s)]
*  They describe it as an intimate private dinner, which is very exclusive. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  I don't even think he does those with Melania, but these 25 people did get to do that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=94.36s)]
*  So they're in lofty company there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=98.44s)]
*  And we don't know who the identities of all the investors are, which is gonna save journalists [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=102.28s)]
*  a lot of time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=107.64s)]
*  Because if you had to look into all these people who are bribing the presidency, you're [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=108.56s)]
*  not gonna get any sleep this weekend. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=111.84s)]
*  So Ken Klippenstein will be able to relax a little bit. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  But anyway, we know that many of them aren't American. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=116.36s)]
*  These are just foreign executives of companies, foreign billionaires, handing over money to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=120.04s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=125.76s)]
*  One of them that we do know about is Justin Sun, a Chinese billionaire who runs the crypto [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=126.76s)]
*  platform Tron. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  He spent more than $40 million on Trump coins. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=133.16s)]
*  Back in 2023, he was charged with market manipulation and offering unregistered securities. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=137.68s)]
*  And in February this year, Trump's SEC agreed to a 60 day pause on the suit in order to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=142.96s)]
*  seek a resolution. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=147.68s)]
*  And so maybe Justin Sun wants something in the future for the $40 million he gave Trump, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  or maybe this is him paying back what he's already gotten. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=155.02s)]
*  But before we jump into the discussion, I just wanna make sure everyone knows. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=158.52s)]
*  We've had these big dinners before where politicians get handed millions of dollars, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=162.44s)]
*  and you sit and you do a photo and you eat salmon or whatever it is that rich people [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=166.8s)]
*  do with these things. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=170.24s)]
*  But that money is like only mostly a bribe. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=171.24s)]
*  It goes to a PAC or it goes to their reelection campaign. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=175.26s)]
*  They can't technically use it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=178.68s)]
*  This just went directly to Donald Trump's bank account. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=181.04s)]
*  Tens of thousands, millions, tens of millions of dollars from individual people going directly [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=184.44s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=190.34s)]
*  You don't even get to know who they are, and then they get to just hang out with Trump. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=191.76s)]
*  And he doesn't have to pay them back for that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=195.88s)]
*  But if he'd like them to buy millions more dollars of his cryptocurrency, he definitely [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=198.32s)]
*  could make promises to them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  And so Cenk, I mentioned the plane. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't know how this compares to that, that I keep calling the biggest bribe in world [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=207.0s)]
*  history. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  This is a little bit more distributed, but this also feels like about the most corrupt [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=213.0s)]
*  act I've ever seen a president engage in. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, this is as direct as it gets. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=221.04s)]
*  Because there's two reasons why this is the worst bribes I've ever seen in American history. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=224.2s)]
*  And that is saying a lot given how we've institutionalized and legalized bribery in this country. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=231.68s)]
*  So number one is what John pointed out. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=237.68s)]
*  This is not a campaign contribution. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=240.86s)]
*  It goes directly into his pocket. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=242.28s)]
*  So no ands, ifs or buts. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=243.72s)]
*  The campaign contributions are legalized bribes, in my opinion, in the opinion of any rational [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  person. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=251.98s)]
*  These are not legalized bribes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=253.22s)]
*  These are just bribe bribes, they're old school bribes, okay? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=255.06s)]
*  The second reason is because of the nature of the vehicle that they are putting the money [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  into. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=262.7s)]
*  So to give you now back up to justice, I'm the guy that John mentioned, and he's the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=264.02s)]
*  poster child for this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=269.5s)]
*  Although there are many people from all across the world at that dinner. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=270.98s)]
*  We'll talk a little bit more about how many foreign investors came to that dinner, including [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=274.22s)]
*  a Korean guy who was saying, yeah, I came here to influence the president in my direction. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=279.1s)]
*  Because they think, I guess, bribery is legal in America. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  So he's letting me do it, everybody's letting me do it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=287.58000000000004s)]
*  So they're just bragging about it, right? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=290.04s)]
*  But Justin Sun is, by the way, a Chinese citizen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=291.72s)]
*  I mean, I hear that if you have a Chinese app like TikTok, or in any way related to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=295.06s)]
*  China, that app should be banned, it's super dangerous, etc. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=300.58s)]
*  But here comes a Chinese guy to give Trump two different things. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=305.02s)]
*  One, he gave him $75 million for World Liberty Financial. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=311.38s)]
*  Now World Liberty Financial is a crypto scam that is at least related to Trump's media [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  companies, which are also a scam and make no money at all, are a giant boondoggle. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=322.98s)]
*  But at least there's something there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=328.68s)]
*  You could pretend that Trump's entertainment companies are one day going to be profitable [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=330.12s)]
*  and somehow World Liberty Financial is related to those. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=334.76s)]
*  You can keep on stretching on that, but you have something to hang your hat on, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=339.66s)]
*  And by the way, after he gave the $75 million, the SEC dropped their investigations of Justin [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=344.88s)]
*  Sun. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=350.2s)]
*  What a wild coincidence, okay? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=351.2s)]
*  But this new 40 million is a different thing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=354.36s)]
*  First of all, the SEC already dropped investigations, I mean, they could restart it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=356.84s)]
*  But it seems like he probably thinks, hey, that $75 million turned out to be a great [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=360.23999999999995s)]
*  bribe. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  I got out of jail, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  I got out of an investigation, I won't be going to, and I could keep scamming anyone [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=366.64s)]
*  I like, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  The 40 million, he probably wants something new. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  Do we know what it is? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=374.64s)]
*  No, because we weren't at the VIP reception, right? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=375.64s)]
*  But the 40 million doesn't go into World Liberty Financial or anything legitimate or even a [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=378.08s)]
*  business. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=382.47999999999996s)]
*  It goes into Trump's meme coin. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  The meme coin is literally worthless. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=386.48s)]
*  And even the biggest crypto fans in the world will tell you, no, meme coins are definitively [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  worthless. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  And you put whatever worth you want into it, and then it just becomes at best an exercise [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  of speculation. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  Hey, I'll get in at $2 and try to get out at $8 before I lose all my money because everyone [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=403.96000000000004s)]
*  here is gonna lose all their money. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=409.6s)]
*  It's a meme coin, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=411.12s)]
*  It's just, there's no value at all. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=412.76s)]
*  So that's taking $40 million and depositing in Donald Trump's bank account. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=417.2s)]
*  Nothing but the most unadulterated bribe you will ever see. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=421.88s)]
*  Yeah, you guys said it all. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=425.64s)]
*  This is literally the definition of pay for play. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=426.98s)]
*  And to me, this is the fatal flaw of every MAGA diehards argument to me. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  Because I mean, I think there's a myriad of reasons why somebody wouldn't like or one [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  of vote for Donald Trump. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=442.6s)]
*  Number one for me was always that the guy seems to be completely in it for himself and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=444.32000000000005s)]
*  nobody else. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  And I don't think that's how a politician should operate. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=452.16s)]
*  And generally, when you hear MAGA people talk about this obvious fatal flaw in the guy, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  they'll talk out of both sides of their mouth. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=461.12s)]
*  It's like, he's so rich already, he's incorruptible. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  Then you'd be like, well, why is he cheating on taxes? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=467.36s)]
*  Why is he running a fake school? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=470.6s)]
*  All of this stuff's for money. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=472.48s)]
*  Well, he's a businessman, he likes money. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  So which one is it? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  Is he imperious to money and its trappings because he has so [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=477.76s)]
*  much of it or does he absolutely love it and therefore is so obviously corruptible? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=482.88s)]
*  And this pay for play scheme with the meme coin is just another example of that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=489.16s)]
*  These people just come in and again, all I ever heard in previous administrations, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  the corruption of foreign influence. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=500.76000000000005s)]
*  Foreigners are the enemy, foreigners are messed up. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=502.68s)]
*  Hunter Biden was working for the Ukrainians, foreigners. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  Most of the people that hold the biggest shareholders in this Trump coin are foreigners. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=510.64000000000004s)]
*  This is by definition foreign influence and it's right in everybody's face. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=517.08s)]
*  Yeah, I find myself at a bit of a loss. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=523.4s)]
*  I think of myself as a generally smart person. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=528.5999999999999s)]
*  But this whole thing over the past six months, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  I feel like there's a lot of really fundamental questions that aren't being asked. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  So like Duke Cunningham, Cenk, you remember him? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=538.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. He got in trouble for bribery. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=542.52s)]
*  I looked it up. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=544.64s)]
*  One of the things he got in trouble for was he sold his home at an inflated price. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't the market value. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=550.1999999999999s)]
*  Dude really should have gone into crypto instead, because there's no value. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=552.5999999999999s)]
*  You can just do anything you want. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=556.1199999999999s)]
*  They complained that Hunter Biden was selling the paintings he made for [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=557.48s)]
*  too much money just because of who he was connected to. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, dude wasted his time painting that takes hours. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=565.84s)]
*  He should have just launched a meme coin and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=569.12s)]
*  then I guess he could have taken as many millions as he wanted. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=571.12s)]
*  Like the money under the stall in a bathroom or whatever. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=574.2s)]
*  Why do that in cash? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  Launch a meme coin, anyone can do it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=579.6s)]
*  If AOC launched a coin today and said I'm selling one meme coin, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=582.76s)]
*  whoever gives me the most can have it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  And George Soros is like, I'll give you a billion dollars for that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=589.88s)]
*  Straight to her bank account. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=593.4s)]
*  That is evidently not illegal in any way. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=595.48s)]
*  And I feel like this is just such a massive gaping hole in the law that nobody [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=600.32s)]
*  wants to even look at it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=605.28s)]
*  Why are there any campaign finance laws anymore when you can launch [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=607.8000000000001s)]
*  a cryptocurrency, you can sell a digital trading card. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=612.1999999999999s)]
*  I can make 30 of them right now on chat GPT in five minutes. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=615.64s)]
*  We sell a bunch of million dollars each. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  Rich donors can just hand me literally as much money as they want. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=622.3199999999999s)]
*  Doesn't have to go to a pack. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=624.52s)]
*  No disclosure, just go straight to me. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=626.12s)]
*  Am I an idiot that I'm asking these? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=630.52s)]
*  I don't understand what any campaign finance laws are meant to accomplish [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=632.88s)]
*  anymore since there's nothing that can be done at hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=636.04s)]
*  being handed over directly to a politician. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=640.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  Cenk, I'm not trying to ask rhetorical questions. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=643.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=646.28s)]
*  Is anyone discussing this? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=646.8s)]
*  So look, no is the quick answer, but [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=648.4399999999999s)]
*  let me give you a bunch of details that are maddening. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=650.7199999999999s)]
*  So the Korean guy that I mentioned earlier is Sang Rok Oh, and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=654.4s)]
*  he said to the New York Times because they're brazen, is graphic three. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=659.56s)]
*  It's kind of a fundraiser for Trump, and he'll always be good to the sponsors. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  So you're just saying it out loud. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=671.04s)]
*  Yeah, okay, and it's a fundraiser not for his campaigns, just for Trump. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  We're all bribing Trump because he's good to his sponsors. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  So he'll look out for Korean citizens first. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  Hey, congratulations, America First, that was frustrated. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=682.68s)]
*  You're frustrated that it turned out it was Israel first? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=685.68s)]
*  No, now you got Taiwan second, and then Korea third, and Qatar. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=688.68s)]
*  Well, now Qatar is second. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=693.0799999999999s)]
*  Then we're going to have to move those guys. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=694.88s)]
*  It's just an open auction, okay? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=696.0799999999999s)]
*  John mentioned Duke Honeyham. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=698.68s)]
*  So that guy was a hilarious story, right? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=701.3599999999999s)]
*  We covered that a million years ago. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=703.68s)]
*  We've been around forever. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=704.92s)]
*  He did this weeping press conference right before going to prison. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=706.5999999999999s)]
*  And he was like, I'm so sorry, but I found Jesus. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=711.04s)]
*  My God, I apologize to Jesus. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=714.1999999999999s)]
*  We found out that just a couple minutes earlier, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=716.3599999999999s)]
*  as he was driving to the press conference, he had loaded up some of the bribes that he [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=719.0s)]
*  had gotten into a laundry bag and tossed it while driving out of the car and [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=722.9599999999999s)]
*  down to his wife's front lawn, okay? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=728.36s)]
*  So and then just minutes later, he found Jesus. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=732.44s)]
*  But now, yeah, he's a rank amateur compared to Trump. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=737.24s)]
*  And he's got to be thinking, I went to jail? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=741.12s)]
*  I went to jail for inflating the price of the house and a couple other trinkets. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=743.76s)]
*  This guy's taking $40 million at a time in unadulterated- [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=748.4s)]
*  Jake, the Bob Menendez, the gold bars. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=752.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=755.44s)]
*  Could he have just sold- [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=755.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=757.36s)]
*  The cryptocurrency. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=757.88s)]
*  Yes, I'm going to get to that next. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=758.72s)]
*  But just so you know, well, who's going to watch The Watchers? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=760.76s)]
*  No one. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=764.8s)]
*  Trump has now pardoned several people who have committed white collar crime, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=765.32s)]
*  almost all of it financial fraud. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=769.44s)]
*  By the way, has gotten money from almost all of those folks. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=771.84s)]
*  There's one guy I can't trace the money from. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=774.84s)]
*  I don't know why he did it or maybe they did the meme coin, etc. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=777.32s)]
*  And we don't know about it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=780.2s)]
*  But almost every person that he's released from white collar fraud charges has given [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=781.68s)]
*  him money in one way or another. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=786.84s)]
*  And then he fired the white collar crime investigators at the SEC, the IRS, etc. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=789.28s)]
*  So he's firing every cop that might look into white collar crime. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=796.6s)]
*  So who the hell is, even if it's illegal, no one is allowed to prosecute. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=801.1999999999999s)]
*  Imagine if Pam Bondi at the Department of Justice and Cash Patel were like, yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=806.52s)]
*  We're opening an investigation against the president because he's obviously taking bribes. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=811.8s)]
*  There's a 0% chance of that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=815.8399999999999s)]
*  Imagine Republican senators impeaching him over taking bribes, 0%. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=818.16s)]
*  So there's no law left. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=822.16s)]
*  This is the lawlessness that I despise. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=823.64s)]
*  This is the corruption I despise. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=826.1999999999999s)]
*  And let's note the great irony of this brother running a campaign on Drain the Swamp, please. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=828.76s)]
*  So now to John's point, it's devastating. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=834.4799999999999s)]
*  And John, I hadn't even quite connected it until you said it. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=837.0s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=840.4s)]
*  Now, every politician is going to open up a meme coin. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  They'd be stupid not to. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=844.48s)]
*  And by the way, foreign countries, I mean, now Israel and Qatar will have the biggest [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=847.28s)]
*  auction you've ever seen in your life. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=853.28s)]
*  All right, now I've got a senator from Texas going once, going twice. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=855.44s)]
*  Which foreign country would like to buy this son of a bitch? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=859.48s)]
*  Okay, he's open and he will not only serve you loyally, he'll screw over every American, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=861.5600000000001s)]
*  he'll hand over all the taxpayer money to you so you get 10 times, 100 times, 1,000 [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  times the money you're bribing him with. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=871.4s)]
*  And plus, he'll let you sleep with his wife, especially if it's Ted Cruz. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=873.52s)]
*  So this is the open auction that's going on. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=876.64s)]
*  And if you're MAGA and you said Drain the Swamp and you think this is okay, you don't [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=880.04s)]
*  have any principles at all. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=885.56s)]
*  And you're blinded by your bias and then you're a zombie, right? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=887.36s)]
*  Donald Trump cannot do corruption even though it is worthless. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=892.76s)]
*  I bet they are the foreign influences are giving him $40 million because of their health [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=896.88s)]
*  and because they love America so much. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=901.28s)]
*  And they're saying golly gee, Donald Trump, please be more America first. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=903.16s)]
*  Come on guys, you'd have to be a moron not to realize this is a bribe. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX8p-gpOgvo&t=907.9599999999999s)]
