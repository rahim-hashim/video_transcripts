# The IDF Hits A DISGUSTING New Low
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU)
*  IDF soldiers are intentionally shooting at and killing desperate Palestinians as they're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=0.0s)]
*  trying to get humanitarian aid from this Israeli backed organization. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=6.8s)]
*  Which of course is able to even exist because they defamed UNRWA, they starved Palestinians [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=11.94s)]
*  for months, shut up. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=17.98s)]
*  They starved Palestinians for months. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=19.44s)]
*  And then as the Palestinians are desperate for food, they lure them in with this Gaza [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=22.2s)]
*  humanitarian foundation and shoot at them. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=27.08s)]
*  Upward of 200 people since late May have been shot at and killed by Israeli soldiers. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=29.72s)]
*  I was right and unfortunately this continues because another 36 people have been shot at [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=36.68s)]
*  and killed by the Israeli Defense Forces as they were desperately seeking humanitarian [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  aid from a US and Israel backed Gaza humanitarian foundation hub. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  So 207 more people by the way were injured as a result of these shootings and that's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=56.36s)]
*  according to the Associated Press. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=64.08s)]
*  So just yesterday, there were upward of 200 Palestinians who had been killed in similar [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=65.92s)]
*  circumstances. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=71.48s)]
*  Obviously that death toll is now growing and it's unlikely to stop because Palestinians [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=72.48s)]
*  are in one of the worst situations imaginable in Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  They've been starved for months. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=83.48s)]
*  They're desperate to feed their families. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=85.64s)]
*  They're desperate to feed themselves. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=87.44s)]
*  And so they will risk their lives knowing there's a huge possibility that IDF soldiers [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  are gonna shoot at them as they're trying to get humanitarian aid from one of these [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=95.16s)]
*  hubs. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=98.56s)]
*  So when I call someone like Emily Schrader disgusting repeatedly for denying this reality, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  I do so because I feel it's righteous to do so. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  So what's happening to us about what's really going on isn't okay. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=111.56s)]
*  But what's obviously even worse is the fact that she's providing cover for these heinous [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  acts carried out by the IDF. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  Now, the Israeli military has acknowledged by the way, the Israeli military has acknowledged [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=122.8s)]
*  firing so-called warning shots on previous occasions at people who it says approached [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=128.96s)]
*  its forces in a suspicious manner. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=135.56s)]
*  The foundation says there has been no violence in or around the distribution points themselves, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=137.72s)]
*  but it has warned people to stay on designated access routes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=145.04s)]
*  There's a lot of admission happening in what I just read to you, okay? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=149.24s)]
*  First of all, the military acknowledging that they're actually firing the shots is huge [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=154.0s)]
*  because previously they were denying it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=160.76s)]
*  But there was a CNN investigation where they analyzed the shots fired and found that those [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=163.2s)]
*  shots were consistent with the IDF's weaponry. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=167.88s)]
*  Once that investigation came out, it's like, yeah, we were just shooting warning shots, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=172.96s)]
*  the kind of warning shots that kill people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=178.84s)]
*  Okay, yeah, nice. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm glad you guys are finally admitting to your crimes now, although they're using warning [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  shots without actually telling the truth, which was we intentionally shot at and killed [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=186.84s)]
*  desperate Palestinians as they were getting humanitarian aid. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  And then the final thing, if there's no violence being carried out by anyone at these hubs, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=194.44s)]
*  why are they being shot at? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  What are the warning shots for? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=202.44s)]
*  Can someone explain that to me? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=204.4s)]
*  I mean, I think the explanation is actually pretty obvious, which is they just wanna kill [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  these people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=212.44s)]
*  And they've been carrying out acts that make it clear to me that they just wanna kill these [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=217.92s)]
*  And whatever remains, they're gonna try to get out of the Gaza Strip or constrained to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=218.92s)]
*  or confined to a very, very tiny, tiny section until it's so miserable that they'll want [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=227.2s)]
*  to leave the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=233.0s)]
*  But was, I mean, this has been going on. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  I feel like there's no interest in any justice for the Palestinians who have been dealing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  with the barbaric acts of the Israeli government and the IDF. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=242.16s)]
*  And it's just disgusting and hopeless. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  It feels super hopeless. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=248.56s)]
*  In northern Gaza, two men and a child were killed and at least 130 were wounded on Tuesday. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=249.56s)]
*  That's today and that's according to Nader Garhoun. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=256.36s)]
*  He's a spokesperson for the Al-Auda Hospital, which received the casualties. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=260.24s)]
*  He said most were being treated for gunshot wounds. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=265.08s)]
*  So most moral military. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=267.8s)]
*  Man, I remember when they used to trot that one out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=270.64s)]
*  No military has ever taken more pains to not kill civilians than Israel, allegedly, according [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=274.88s)]
*  to Israel, of course, and nobody else. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  Again, it's important for people to know that there is no military objective here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  There's no security threat. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=291.0s)]
*  Hamas can't, they cannot attack Israel's border. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=292.4s)]
*  They can't do another October 7th. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  There is no security threat. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=299.84s)]
*  So Israel's security, vis-a-vis their battle with Hamas, it's non-existent. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=302.24s)]
*  There's no threat there. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=309.92s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=311.56s)]
*  They're just doing this to do it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=313.64s)]
*  It's literally to make life as miserable as possible on the civilian population and terrorize [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=317.04s)]
*  them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=326.24s)]
*  They're committing acts of terrorism. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=327.24s)]
*  There's just no two ways about it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=329.36s)]
*  Whenever you hear these people talk about, well, you must not forget October 7th. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=331.76s)]
*  I'm like, guys, this is Al-Qaeda logic. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=337.56s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  This is terrorist logic. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  The idea that there's this thing that happened that was, yeah, obviously horrible. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=344.2s)]
*  Obviously atrocities were committed. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=350.8s)]
*  So now I'm going to do something that is completely holy, not even in the same proportion. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=352.32s)]
*  Again, and I bring this up again, not because I agree with this guy, but Bin Laden after [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  9-11 was like, bro, the CIA was housed in there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  They were a legitimate military target. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  Nobody would ever say that was legitimate on the part of Al-Qaeda. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=369.88s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=373.6s)]
*  So- [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=374.6s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=375.6s)]
*  You know what's amazing to me? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=376.6s)]
*  They do love to bring up those atrocities that happened on October 7th. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=381.32s)]
*  And I don't blame them for wanting to talk about those atrocities and draw attention [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=384.48s)]
*  to them when they want to justify going after Hamas. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=387.6s)]
*  But there is every indication that this isn't about going after Hamas. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=392.96s)]
*  Okay, this is about- [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=396.84s)]
*  They failed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=397.84s)]
*  And Hamas is, probably got more members now than they did on October 7th. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=398.84s)]
*  But if you want to have a conversation about atrocities like using rape as an act of war, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=403.84s)]
*  Can we discuss the prison guards at the Israeli prisons who have been caught raping Palestinian [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  detainees who haven't been charged with any crimes? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  When that story became public, can we discuss the fact that when there were supposed to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=421.72s)]
*  be consequences for said rapist Israeli prison guards, the insane, unhinged extremist settlers [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  started rioting in order to offer protection for the said rapists? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEUZ3N1SecU&t=433.84000000000003s)]
