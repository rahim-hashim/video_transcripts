TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# This Debate About Gaza Got HEATED
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s)
*  You're disgusting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=0.0s)]
*  You people disgust me. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=1.0s)]
*  They confirmed it was from us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  And the only thing disgusting here, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=5.36s)]
*  this person is intentionally lying [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=7.34s)]
*  and blaming the IDF. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=9.34s)]
*  I can't even remember the voice [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=10.64s)]
*  who is assuring that there's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=12.24s)]
*  humanitarian aid. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=13.84s)]
*  I'm an Armenian, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I know genocide when I see it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=16.04s)]
*  You are a defender of genocide. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=17.92s)]
*  I had a pretty uneventful morning [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=20.84s)]
*  when on Piers Morgan's show today. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=22.8s)]
*  And Emily Schrader, who I believe [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=24.8s)]
*  is a propagandist on behalf of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=26.84s)]
*  the Israeli government, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=28.8s)]
*  triggered me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  I have no problem admitting that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=31.68s)]
*  Because at this point, after now [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  more than a year and a half of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=36.08s)]
*  watching Palestinian civilians get [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=38.36s)]
*  bombed to death, starved to death, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=41.36s)]
*  shelled to death, I literally [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=44.56s)]
*  cannot handle hearing another [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=47.28s)]
*  Israel defender lie to my face [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=49.88s)]
*  about what's really going on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=52.36s)]
*  Emily Schrader falls in that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  category of Israeli propagandists, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=57.3s)]
*  liars, who provide cover for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=59.62s)]
*  atrocities, who provide cover for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=61.42s)]
*  ethnic cleansing, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=63.66s)]
*  who provide cover for genocide. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=64.9s)]
*  And so yeah, I got a little heated [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=66.94s)]
*  to say the least. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  So she's allegedly a journalist. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=69.22s)]
*  Earlier in the debate, she got [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=72.82s)]
*  challenged on the definition of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=76.42s)]
*  Let's take a quick look at that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=77.34s)]
*  It is Hamas that has rejected [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=78.86s)]
*  repeated ceasefires. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=80.34s)]
*  A pause in fighting is not [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=81.38s)]
*  a ceasefire, a pause in fighting is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=82.97999999999999s)]
*  not a ceasefire. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=84.97999999999999s)]
*  I'm so sick of the rebranding of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=85.78s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=87.7s)]
*  A two month pause in war is not [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=88.7s)]
*  a ceasefire, period, end of story. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  Go ahead Omar. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=93.38s)]
*  Then Hamas is welcome, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=94.3s)]
*  Hamas is welcome to release all of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=95.42s)]
*  the hostages. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=97.06s)]
*  I said what I said. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=97.78s)]
*  If you release all of the hostages [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=98.5s)]
*  then we can talk about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  This idea that you release [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=101.14s)]
*  the hostages and as soon as the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=102.34s)]
*  hostages are released Israel will [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=103.82s)]
*  continue their genocide is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=105.58s)]
*  unacceptable, unacceptable. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=107.14s)]
*  But anyway continue. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=110.3s)]
*  You know what else is unacceptable? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=111.02000000000001s)]
*  The fact that there are more than [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=112.18s)]
*  50 hostages being held by Hamas for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=113.42s)]
*  more than 600 days. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=114.86s)]
*  You're a vile individual. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=115.77999999999999s)]
*  I fully stand by my statement [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=117.41999999999999s)]
*  regarding Emily Schrader being [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  a vile individual. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=122.1s)]
*  It is atrocious that you still have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=124.46s)]
*  Israeli captives in the Gaza strip. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=127.46s)]
*  Those hostages haven't been [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=130.98s)]
*  released, they should be released. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=132.7s)]
*  But let's just talk about this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=134.9s)]
*  notion of a ceasefire that only [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=137.06s)]
*  lasts long enough for [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  Hamas to release the hostages. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=140.9s)]
*  And then Israel gets to continue [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=144.02s)]
*  the atrocities they've been carrying [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=145.9s)]
*  out in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=148.18s)]
*  And also by the way, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=150.02s)]
*  the West Bank, let's not forget [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=150.94s)]
*  about the West Bank, which was not [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=152.5s)]
*  governed by Hamas, which has been [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=154.3s)]
*  dealing with the occupation of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=156.34s)]
*  the Israelis. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=158.18s)]
*  And has dealt with settlers coming [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=159.9s)]
*  in driving Palestinians out of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  their legal homes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=164.06s)]
*  You guys get the picture, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=165.94s)]
*  I've talked about this a billion [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  times before. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=168.66s)]
*  Hamas has agreed to give up [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=169.3s)]
*  governing the hostages and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=171.18s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  They have agreed to releasing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=175.38s)]
*  the remainder of the hostages. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=177.46s)]
*  All they want is a permanent [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=180.66s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=183.26000000000002s)]
*  But Israel doesn't want [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  a permanent ceasefire. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=186.22s)]
*  Israel wants to steal that land. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=187.9s)]
*  They want to push out every single [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=190.38s)]
*  Palestinian that survived this war [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  and take over. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=195.38s)]
*  They want to build settlements, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=197.74s)]
*  they announced they're going to be [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=199.18s)]
*  building two illegal settlements in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=200.74s)]
*  the West Bank, they want the land. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=202.54s)]
*  This is the greater Israel [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=205.54s)]
*  project, folks. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=207.34s)]
*  I mean, they tell you what they [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=208.82s)]
*  want to do. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  On one hand, you have the Israeli [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=211.14s)]
*  government straight up telling you [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  what they intend to do. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  And then for whatever reason, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=216.06s)]
*  clowns like Emily Schrader go on [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=218.34s)]
*  various American news programs to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=220.7s)]
*  tell us that we didn't just hear [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=223.22s)]
*  what the Israeli government told [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  us and we're not seeing what our [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=227.66s)]
*  own eyes are seeing in the Gaza [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=229.57999999999998s)]

*  And eventually when they do get [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=238.86s)]

*  every indication tells me that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=241.78s)]

*  there's more. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=278.9s)]
*  So Schrader also got challenged on [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=280.5s)]
*  a talking point that she made [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=282.62s)]
*  about a year earlier. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=284.42s)]
*  She was on Piers Morgan's show [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=285.94s)]
*  with Abby Martin, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=287.66s)]
*  excellent on this topic, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  on this issue. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=290.22s)]
*  And she made a declaration about [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=291.66s)]
*  what Israel intends to do and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  what they will not do. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  And she was wrong about that, so [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  I challenged her, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=298.94s)]
*  let's take a look. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=299.74s)]
*  You were on this very show a year [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=300.86s)]
*  ago debating Abby Martin. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=302.54s)]
*  And you said, you fancy yourself [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=304.38s)]
*  a journalist, during that debate, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=305.98s)]
*  you said that Israel has no [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=307.94s)]
*  interest in occupying Gaza. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  Israel is now very obviously and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=311.86s)]
*  overtly claiming they intend to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=313.94s)]
*  occupy Gaza. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=315.86s)]
*  Can you now admit to the world [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=317.22s)]
*  that you are incorrect? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=318.94000000000005s)]
*  No, the situation on the ground [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=322.34000000000003s)]
*  changes and beyond that, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=323.82000000000005s)]
*  this could have been avoided in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=325.06s)]
*  the first place. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=326.5s)]
*  You're vile, you're vile, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=327.26000000000005s)]
*  you're a vile person. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  She's a vile person, straight up. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=329.58000000000004s)]
*  The inability, first of all, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=331.86s)]
*  the initial lie, let's just call [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  that for what it was, it was a lie. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=336.26000000000005s)]
*  And then the inability to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=339.62s)]
*  acknowledge reality. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=341.74s)]
*  Okay, I knew, everyone who's paying [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=344.94000000000005s)]
*  attention knew that Israel [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=346.94s)]
*  intended to ethnically cleanse [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=348.78s)]
*  Gaza and occupy the, I mean, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=350.94s)]
*  just take over the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=352.86s)]
*  Everyone knew, everyone who's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=354.66s)]
*  paying attention, who's honest [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=356.14s)]
*  about what they're reading, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=357.62s)]
*  what they're seeing, they knew. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=359.02s)]
*  Abby Martin brings it up, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=360.62s)]
*  calls her out on it, and she says, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=362.3s)]
*  no, Israel has no interest in [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=364.5s)]
*  occupying Gaza. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=366.62s)]
*  And then when she gets called out [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=367.94s)]
*  on it, called out on that lie a year [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=369.74s)]
*  later, unable to take responsibility, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=371.74s)]
*  that's a journalist, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=374.14s)]
*  it's incredible, total and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=375.62s)]
*  utter clown. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  So another pro-Israel voice on [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=379.41999999999996s)]
*  the panel was Shavos Kestenbaum. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  And look, I disagree with Shavos [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=385.09999999999997s)]
*  entirely, he seems less loathsome [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=388.34s)]
*  than Emily Schrader. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=391.97999999999996s)]
*  He tried to have a calm [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=394.58s)]
*  conversation, I was too heated. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  And I regret that, because I could [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=398.38s)]
*  have had an exchange with him that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=400.78s)]
*  wasn't a good conversation, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=402.94s)]
*  that wasn't as heated as it was. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=405.14s)]
*  He was trying to lower [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=407.7s)]
*  the temperature and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=408.5s)]
*  make the arguments he was making. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=409.17999999999995s)]
*  I disagree with his arguments, so [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  I want to just kind of get that out [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=412.21999999999997s)]
*  of the way. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=413.53999999999996s)]
*  With that in mind, at one point, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=414.05999999999995s)]
*  he stated that everyone who cares [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=415.82s)]
*  about Palestinians should be [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=417.65999999999997s)]

*  And this is why the international [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=507.86s)]
*  community went from having quite a [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=509.78000000000003s)]
*  bit of goodwill toward the Israelis [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=511.78000000000003s)]
*  to now wanting to prosecute them, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=513.94s)]
*  the members of the Israeli [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  government in the International [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=517.62s)]
*  Criminal Court. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=519.7s)]
*  You can't on one hand, and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=522.6600000000001s)]
*  this is very important for [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=524.1800000000001s)]
*  any Israeli defenders out there, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=525.6600000000001s)]
*  this is very important. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=527.62s)]
*  You cannot make a succinct argument [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=529.1400000000001s)]
*  about Hamas carrying out atrocities [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=532.26s)]
*  when the IDF is doing the same [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=535.34s)]
*  thing and you think it's okay. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=537.86s)]
*  Because if you say it's okay when [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=540.58s)]
*  it's being done to Palestinians, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=542.7800000000001s)]
*  you're providing justification for [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=545.1800000000001s)]
*  Hamas doing it to Israelis. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=547.78s)]
*  Because guess what? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=549.82s)]
*  Humans are humans, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=551.14s)]
*  civilians are civilians and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=552.26s)]
*  they must be protected. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=553.98s)]
*  When you come out here and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=555.42s)]
*  you make clear that you're [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=556.82s)]
*  supportive of civilians on one side, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=558.38s)]
*  but you think of civilians as utter [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=560.62s)]
*  animals that should be slaughtered [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=562.58s)]
*  on the other side, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=564.5s)]
*  you lose the argument, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=565.46s)]
*  you lose the international [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=566.74s)]
*  community, it's that simple. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=568.3s)]
*  And that's the thing that discussed [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=570.14s)]
*  me about this whole situation, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=572.02s)]
*  what discussed me about people like [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=573.58s)]
*  Emily Schrader, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=575.3s)]
*  the lack of humanity, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=576.7s)]
*  the lack of being able to look at [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=578.58s)]
*  Palestinian children and [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=580.98s)]
*  be disgusted with what the IDF is [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=582.86s)]
*  doing right now. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=585.26s)]
*  I don't understand, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=587.9s)]
*  I literally don't understand it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=588.98s)]
*  It boggles my mind, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=590.7s)]
*  absolutely boggles my mind. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=591.98s)]
*  We'll end with one more clip. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=593.98s)]
*  I want to thank Pierce Morgan for [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=596.22s)]
*  giving me the last word on the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=597.7s)]
*  panel and I did switch topics [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=599.18s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=600.74s)]
*  It's related, but it's a little bit [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=601.62s)]
*  of a different topic, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=603.54s)]
*  important for [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=604.9s)]
*  everyone to know about. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=605.5s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=606.3s)]
*  I just want to mention quickly that [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=607.34s)]
*  Emily is one of these Israelis [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=609.22s)]
*  who's going around doing propaganda [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=610.86s)]
*  tours on manufacturing consent for [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=612.62s)]
*  the United States to go to war with [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=614.54s)]
*  Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=616.42s)]
*  We can't make the same mistake that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=618.7s)]
*  we did in Iraq, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=620.26s)]
*  we should not go to war in Iran on [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=621.02s)]
*  behalf of Israel. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=622.78s)]
*  If Israel wants to go to war with [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  Iran, they should do it themselves [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=625.42s)]
*  without our military support and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=627.1800000000001s)]
*  that includes taxpayer dollars. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=629.02s)]
*  Go do it on your own. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=631.46s)]
*  Go ahead and enlist baby girl, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=632.54s)]
*  go do your thing, but [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=634.02s)]
*  leave America out of it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=635.34s)]
*  Our men and women and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=637.02s)]
*  our armed forces shouldn't die on [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=638.06s)]
*  behalf of your country, period. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't really understand what her [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=642.18s)]
*  argument was there when she's like [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=643.62s)]
*  Iran isn't an Arab country. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=645.22s)]
*  I didn't say it was an Arab country. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=647.9399999999999s)]
*  And what is that argument? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=650.26s)]
*  The US should not go to war with [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=653.02s)]
*  Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=654.46s)]
*  Now, Israel has bought our [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=656.1s)]
*  politician, so who knows what [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=658.02s)]
*  the Trump administration is going [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=660.18s)]
*  to decide to do. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=662.46s)]
*  It will be a disastrous war. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=663.5s)]
*  It will be a deeply, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=665.14s)]
*  deeply unpopular war that will [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=666.74s)]
*  define Donald Trump's legacy. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=669.1s)]
*  I mean, the one thing he cares [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=672.7s)]
*  about the most is himself. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=674.06s)]
*  So hopefully he's smart enough to [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=675.18s)]
*  understand what an error that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=677.22s)]
*  would be for his legacy. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=679.02s)]
*  But I don't really have much hope [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=681.42s)]
*  with any politician much less [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=683.42s)]
*  Donald Trump at this point. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=685.26s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=687.54s)]
*  But I want to be clear for anyone [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=689.9s)]
*  who thinks my behavior and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=692.78s)]
*  my conduct on Piers Morgan's show [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=694.9s)]
*  today was unprofessional and [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=697.8199999999999s)]
*  unbecoming, you're correct. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=700.54s)]
*  And I am not sorry. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=704.02s)]
*  I would do it again. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=706.2199999999999s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=707.78s)]
*  an angel gets a swings. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=709.3399999999999s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=710.9s)]
*  you updated on our live shows. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R5mMNwn21s&t=712.4599999999999s)]
