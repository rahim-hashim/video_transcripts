# Israel Announces Plans To STEAL TERRITORY In Gaza
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE)
*  הלילה ברצועת עזה העברנו הילוך. צה'ה לתופש שטחים [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=0.0s)]
*  תושבי עזה, בקרוב יפעל צה'ה ועוצמה באזורים נוספים בעזה [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=7.0s)]
*  ואתם תדרשו להתפנות למען הגנתכם מתוך אזורי הלחימה [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=12.0s)]
*  התוכניות כבר מוכנות ומועשרות [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=17.0s)]
*  החמאס מסכם את חייכם ויגרום לכם להעבל את בתיכם [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=20.0s)]
*  ועוד ועוד שטח שסורף למערך ההגנה הישראלי [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=25.0s)]
*  של land for security purposes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=50.0s)]
*  They haven't been eyeing that land for literally decades, right? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=53.0s)]
*  Okay, so in his statement on Wednesday, Kat said that Israel was renewing and expanding military operations [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=58.0s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip to crush and cleanse, to crush and cleanse the area of terrorists [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=65.0s)]
*  and terrorist infrastructure and seize large areas that will be annexed to the security zones [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=72.0s)]
*  of the state of Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=78.0s)]
*  The minister said that a large scale evacuation of the Gazan population from the fighting areas [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=80.0s)]
*  is accompanying the expanded military campaign in the Strip. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=87.0s)]
*  Now Kat's also continued the Israeli government's, in my opinion, faux concern [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=92.0s)]
*  over the hostages that remain in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=100.0s)]
*  And I say faux concern because how are you going to argue your concerned [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=103.0s)]
*  about the well-being of the hostages when you've been bombing the crap out of the Gaza Strip? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=107.0s)]
*  When your own forces killed hostages themselves, barely even apologized for it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=113.0s)]
*  Do we even know the fate of those IDF soldiers who killed the Israeli hostages, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=121.0s)]
*  who actually managed to escape, were shirtless and were asking for help? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=127.0s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, but they're worried about the hostages. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=133.0s)]
*  I'm sure Kat's up all night worried about them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=135.0s)]
*  Anyway, he says, you know, I'm worried, like, faux concern. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=139.0s)]
*  I call on the residents of Gaza to act now to eliminate Hamas and return all the kidnapped. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=144.0s)]
*  This is the only way to end the war. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=150.0s)]
*  By the way, I mean, we're talking about Hamas, which is awful, and what they did on October 7th was awful. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=153.0s)]
*  But let's also just acknowledge once more that we're talking about Israel that is backed by the largest [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=158.0s)]
*  and most powerful military power in the world, the United States. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=166.0s)]
*  Hamas ain't got no military. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=170.0s)]
*  They don't have the weapon capability that Israel has. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=172.0s)]
*  They don't have the defense capacity that Israel has. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=176.0s)]
*  But the way that the Israeli forces and the Israeli government talk about Hamas, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=180.0s)]
*  you would think, oh my God, I'm a formidable opponent. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=184.0s)]
*  Let me continue. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=190.0s)]
*  So Kat's statement did not make clear how much land Israel intends to seize or exactly how they intend to seize it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=192.0s)]
*  I'm going to predict that ultimately they intend to seize all of it through brutal military force, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=199.0s)]
*  ethnic cleansing, and the slaughtering of a ton of people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=207.0s)]
*  I mean, tens of thousands of civilians, women, children, elderly people, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=211.0s)]
*  civilian men of fighting age who are not part of Hamas, they've been slaughtered. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=217.0s)]
*  Medics have been tossed into shallow mass graves. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=223.0s)]
*  Children have been targeted by Israeli snipers, showing up to hospitals with gunshot wounds in their heads. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=226.0s)]
*  According to American doctors, by the way, who have risked their lives to provide some humanitarian relief on the ground in Gaza. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=237.0s)]
*  And evacuation orders have already been issued demanding Gazans living around Ra'afah, which by the way, we all know where Ra'afah is, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=244.0s)]
*  Ra'afah is close to the Gaza border with Egypt. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=252.0s)]
*  So why are they evacuating Ra'afah? That's interesting. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=257.0s)]
*  Interesting security zone. Okay. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=261.0s)]
*  So they're going to now evacuate Ra'afah, which is again near the border with Egypt, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=263.0s)]
*  and Khan Yunis to move to areas closer to the shore. We're going to push them out into the ocean. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=269.0s)]
*  But let's keep it real, Israel does intend to take control over all of that land. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=274.0s)]
*  I think they've been pretty obvious about it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=279.0s)]
*  Katz last month announced the creation of a new directorate within the Israeli Ministry of Defense to facilitate the voluntary immigration [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=281.0s)]
*  out of strip. The directorate's work aligns with US President Donald Trump's suggestion that Palestinians be resettled outside of Gaza. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=291.0s)]
*  Katz said in February. Now, where do they go? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=300.0s)]
*  I mean, no country is willing to absorb Palestinian refugees, partly because they just don't want refugees, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=302.0s)]
*  but also partly because they don't want to aid in a bet the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians by the Israeli government. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=311.0s)]
*  So far, according to the Israeli rights group Gisha, Israel has already taken control of some 62 square kilometers, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=318.0s)]
*  or around 17% of the total area of Gaza as part of a buffer zone around the edges of the enclave. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=326.0s)]
*  But there is critical infrastructure that Gazans live in and rely on in the so-called buffer zone. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=333.0s)]
*  And that includes wells, sewage pumping stations, wastewater treatment facilities, and also a significant chunk of Gaza's agricultural land. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=340.0s)]
*  So losing access to those resources will make it even more difficult for Palestinians who are having a difficult time surviving to continue surviving [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=349.0s)]
*  if this war comes to an end and they manage to make it out alive. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=359.0s)]
*  So here's one Gaza residents reaction to Israel announcing their plan to take control of yet more land in the strip. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=365.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just, you see the images on the ground. It's just absolutely brutal. And intentionally so. It's meant to be unlivable. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=395.0s)]
*  The aerial bombardments, the destruction of infrastructure, the destruction of hospitals, universities, refugee camps, residential buildings, that's all intentional. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=424.0s)]
*  So when Trump talks about, no one wants to live there, Gazans don't want to live there. I mean, it's unlivable. Yeah, yeah, it is unlivable. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=433.0s)]
*  On purpose, it was made unlivable with the bombs that we American taxpayers are funding on behalf of the Israeli government so they can drop them. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=441.0s)]
*  On the heads of these Palestinian people, destroy everything they have. It's just hilarious, right? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=452.0s)]
*  To point to the awful situation on the ground that we aided and abetted and then use that as the justification for the ethnic cleansing that is to come. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=459.0s)]
*  So the hostage families, God bless them. I feel so terrible for them because their own government doesn't care about the hostages, clearly. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=471.0s)]
*  They've been protesting, they've been demanding that the war come to an end to no avail. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=478.0s)]
*  So the families of the remaining Israeli hostages are furious about Katz's plan saying the government is prioritizing territorial gains over getting the 24 living hostages home safe. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=484.0s)]
*  So I'm not the only one saying it. The family members of the hostages are saying that this is all about territorial gains. Take a look. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=496.0s)]
*  Families of hostages here released a statement saying they were horrified by what he had said and asking whether a decision had been made to sacrifice the Israeli hostages on the altar of gaining land. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=504.0s)]
*  So he has since issued a new statement saying no, that the purpose of taking these lands is to press Hamas into releasing the hostages. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=519.0s)]
*  We have to mention that this tactic has never functioned. Not a single Israeli hostage of the 251 hostages taken on October 7th, 2023 were ever released as a result of this sort of military pressure. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=530.0s)]
*  And Hamas is making clear military pressure isn't going to work. The only way you're going to get these living hostages back is if we negotiate a peace deal. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=548.0s)]
*  But Israel doesn't want a peace deal. They don't care about the hostages. They want the land. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=556.0s)]
*  Let's call a spade a spade. I'm not here to caress the BS of any side here. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=564.0s)]
*  The Israeli government's been lying from the very beginning. And what they've actually wanted to do has been very clear. They've been very brazen about it from the very beginning. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=574.0s)]
*  They don't care about the hostages. I can't imagine engaging in the kind of warfare the IDF has engaged in. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=584.0s)]
*  Knowing that the hostages are there and they are suffering the same way the Palestinian people are suffering. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=593.0s)]
*  They never cared about the hostages from the very beginning. Let's stop pretending. Please, it's insulting. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=601.0s)]
*  It's insulting to the intelligence of everyone paying attention to this story and it's insulting to the family members who have had to bear the absolute torture of knowing their own government doesn't give a damn about their family members. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=608.0s)]
*  That's the reality of the situation. Netanyahu is a really bad guy. It's hard for me to think of anyone on the international stage that I despise more than Netanyahu. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=622.0s)]
*  He's an evil person who has fostered a lot of bad will against the Israeli people because he's a selfish prick. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=633.0s)]
*  He's a corrupt, disgusting, authoritarian prick. And we fund him. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOEVqZ_UDjE&t=643.0s)]
