# Laura Ingraham Is NOT HAVING Alina Habba‚Äôs Spin
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY)
*  A little murmuring in Maggalan about the comments about China today. Did MAGA vote for China to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=0.0s)]
*  able to buy up more American real estate or American companies, they ask. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Is that really a question? Really, that's what we're doing now, the spin, that's the spin. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=14.56s)]
*  Last night, Laura Ingraham and Alina Habba had a heated back and forth on the issue of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=19.92s)]
*  Chinese investments in America. Now, let me just preface this by saying, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=28.16s)]
*  I can't believe how much I agree with Laura Ingraham on this matter, but I do agree with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=35.52s)]
*  Laura Ingraham on this matter. And I also agree with anyone else who thinks it's a crazy idea to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=40.0s)]
*  allow foreign countries and foreign businesses to buy American real estate, American land, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=44.32s)]
*  you get the picture. But nonetheless, yesterday Trump said that he would actually welcome those [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=49.92s)]
*  investments, but Ingraham, not a big fan of his comments. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=55.12s)]
*  I see so many things saying that we don't want China in this country, that's not right. We want [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=58.32s)]
*  them to invest in the United States, that's good. There's a lot of money coming in and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=64.96s)]
*  we'll invest in China. Okay, but China's already bought up American companies, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  agricultural interests, and huge swaths of land and properties, including some that we've [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=76.64s)]
*  documented here on the angle near our military bases. But did MAGA turn out for Trump because [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  they wanted more of that? Or they want thousands of more foreign workers here to drive down wages [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  and opportunities for Americans? A fine line must be walked, Americans first, always, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=94.16s)]
*  no matter what the donors want. Damn right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  Wow. No, I agree with her. I totally agree with her. In fact, I got a lot of heat because, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=106.32s)]
*  and by the way, this isn't just a China thing. I don't think any foreign countries should be [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=111.36s)]
*  buying up American land or American real estate, period, okay? By the way, you wanna talk about [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=115.92s)]
*  China? Let's go to downtown Los Angeles, where there is a massive abandoned high rise that a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=121.12s)]
*  Chinese firm started building. They run out of money, they go bankrupt, and that's it, they take [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=129.28s)]
*  off. And that building is, I mean, it's just covered in graffiti. It has become a complete [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=135.12s)]
*  utter disaster. It's right next to the Staples Center that's been renamed crypto, whatever, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=141.44s)]
*  but Staples Center. Yeah. So look at Laura Ingraham calling out the donors, let alone everything else. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=147.04s)]
*  Yeah, I like it. And what donor is she talking about? Because there is one donor that has a lot [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=154.4s)]
*  of deals with China, and his name rhymes with Tilon. So that was an interesting call out there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=160.0s)]
*  And so for everyone on the left who said no, there'll never be any lack of unity on the right, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=168.0s)]
*  that everyone in right wing media and everyone in Trump voters will never break with him and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=175.2s)]
*  they'll justify every single thing he does. This Fox News and Laura Ingraham, by the way, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=181.28s)]
*  this is just one of three stories today where they're an open rebellion, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=188.48s)]
*  Well, look, I think people, look, I don't know what percentage, we haven't run a study or a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  poll on it. But I think at least some people who voted for Trump and believed in his message [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=198.0s)]
*  are now starting to wake up to the fact that the MAGA movement has completely been co-opted [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=205.28s)]
*  by tech billionaires and corporate interests. I mean, the proof is in the pudding. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=210.88s)]
*  You can see it, and you can see how much Trump has flip-flopped on some of his core messaging, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=215.6s)]
*  right? I mean, think about it. I remember Greg Abbott in Texas and Ron DeSantis in Florida [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=221.12s)]
*  got a lot of flak from the left because they banned Chinese investment in residential real estate, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=227.44s)]
*  near military bases. They banned China from being able to buy land in their states. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=234.72s)]
*  And I thought, no, I think this is the right course of action, especially when it comes to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=240.64s)]
*  residential real estate, which a lot of these foreign business people like to park their money [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=245.76s)]
*  in, but they have no interest in actually living in those homes. It robs the American people of the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=251.2s)]
*  limited housing inventory that's left out there. It's disgusting. So I like what happened in Texas [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=256.64s)]
*  and in Florida. Trump was supposed to be totally in line with that all of a sudden. No, we want [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=262.4s)]
*  their investments. So we're gonna show you a little bit more of Ingram and Habba brawling [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=267.36s)]
*  a little bit. It was super interesting. But there's one tiny clip that makes all the difference. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  And I'm ready to declare it. They're gonna get caught. Now, I mean Trump and Elon. So I wanna [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  explain why, but first, let's give you the context here. And then I wanna go to that short clip that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=283.6s)]
*  I think is so telling. So Ingram brought on Habba, and they were getting into a bit of an argument. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=287.92s)]
*  So he had an argument about this whole situation. Let's take a look. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=295.36s)]
*  That's the spin. Yeah, no, what the president said was very simple. It's the same policy we've had [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=297.76s)]
*  across the board when you look at reciprocal tariffs, when you look at the strong arm that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  President Trump has had with China, with Canada, with Mexico. We want America to be safe. We care [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=310.0s)]
*  about American people first. It's like what you just said in your monologue. I couldn't have said [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=315.2s)]
*  it better. America first. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=318.72s)]
*  Well, Alina, but you can't buy, reciprocity would mean Americans can go off and buy [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=320.76000000000005s)]
*  lots of Chinese real estate. Real estate near military bases, which I know President Trump [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  is not in favor of. But the concern obviously is like, the deals are great, and so much of them [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  are phenomenal. But you see where Democrats are starting to warm their way into the populist [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  agenda and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, how is that for the American worker to bring in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=345.12s)]
*  thousands of more foreign workers? That is what some on the MAGA side are [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=349.92s)]
*  kind of whispering about, but nevertheless, it's out there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=357.04s)]
*  Don't whisper about it because you're right. You're right. Okay, those who are against what [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=359.2s)]
*  Trump is saying about Chinese investment in the United States are correct. Whether you're on the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=366.56s)]
*  left or the right, who cares, right? Are you or are you not concerned about our country and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=370.64s)]
*  investments within our country? Okay, so they're fighting, but they're trying to keep it civil. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=377.36s)]
*  Totally. Right, and so I mean, some of the deals are great and all that. And so she doesn't wanna [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=382.24s)]
*  blame right at all the Laura Ingraham. And so that's why she invented this thing with the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=386.88s)]
*  Democrats are warming their way into populism. Really? Just Chuck Schumer doing that? Is it [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=391.84s)]
*  that he's doing that? He's the king of warming his way into populism. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=396.24s)]
*  Really? Seriously, I didn't know we and Brocona and Bernie were that powerful. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=399.44s)]
*  Because we're about the only ones doing left-wing populism and insisting on left-wing populism. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=406.08s)]
*  And not like corporate or far left or anything like that. That's the lane, right? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. Somehow we, okay, great. I'm super happy to take it. Yes. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=419.04s)]
*  We're warming our way in. Yes, we've been populist for 20 years. Welcome, Laura. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=423.04s)]
*  Obviously, the criticism that she's hearing and the criticism that she herself agrees with [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=428.0s)]
*  is coming from right-wing Trump voters. For good reason, this goes against, it flies in the face [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=433.04s)]
*  of what Trump promised and what he campaigned on. Now, let's go to the final video where [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=439.12s)]
*  Habba gets the last word on this argument with Laura Ingraham. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=445.04s)]
*  Let me clarify that then if there's any confusion. What the president was referring to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=449.04s)]
*  was us continuing to have business relations. We do import export. Of course we do. That is [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=454.8s)]
*  what we're talking about. Yes, we are going to be a strong nation. Yes, we are going to have [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=461.20000000000005s)]
*  peace through strength. Yes, we are going to have a stronger economy and we are going to cut the fat [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=465.92s)]
*  through Doge, through the president's initiatives. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=470.24s)]
*  And what we have voted, the American people have voted for on November 5th. But that means [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=472.72s)]
*  yes, we're going to be tough, but we still want to make money. We still want to be producing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=478.08s)]
*  We still want to work with other countries. China is just another example. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=481.84s)]
*  It's a lot like Laura when the president says something like Putin is bright or Putin. That [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=485.2s)]
*  doesn't mean he's praising him. That means that he is acknowledging the situation. What is good [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=491.76s)]
*  for America? What is America first? If you say we're not going to have Amazon, we're not going to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=496.64s)]
*  have anything imported or exported with China. That's not realistic. That's not what he's saying. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  We want to do business, but it's got to be done the right way. And that is what the president [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=504.32s)]
*  was referring to. But of course, this been Israel as you know. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=507.68s)]
*  I thought the mention of Amazon was fascinating in what she said there because [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=510.32s)]
*  Jeff Bezos has been on his hands and knees praising Donald Trump. He just censored his [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=517.76s)]
*  own editorial writers. They're allowed to talk about freedom. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=524.88s)]
*  They're allowed to talk about. Although they're not free to talk about freedom. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=528.8s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. So but look, make no mistake. Amazon would collapse if it didn't have access to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=533.6s)]
*  cheaply made Chinese goods that of course are manufactured using exploited labor in China as [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=541.76s)]
*  well. So I think that there are multiple factors behind Donald Trump's decision to essentially [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=549.6s)]
*  renege on his promises to his own voters when it comes to this type of issue. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=555.2s)]
*  But look, the broader picture is there's the corporate wing and then there's the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=560.72s)]
*  populist wing. The corporate wing has completely taken over Trump's administration. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=566.64s)]
*  Yeah, not the voters, but the administration. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=572.32s)]
*  100%. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=574.72s)]
*  So look guys, can you make some deals with China? Of course, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=575.2800000000001s)]
*  should we cut off all trade to China? Of course not. Import export, sure, right? But that doesn't [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=579.76s)]
*  mean that they should get to buy real estate. And you could have real rules around that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  What does Trump care the most about? And if you don't know it, if you're on the right, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=589.52s)]
*  come on guys, I don't know when you're gonna catch up. Money. He cares about money to himself, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=594.24s)]
*  to his friends and allies so that he could have even more power and money. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=598.96s)]
*  And so if you think no, no, no, he's got our best interests in mind. Okay, all right, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=602.64s)]
*  let's see how it turns out. But you're beginning to see how it turns out and that's why there's [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=605.68s)]
*  the murmurs. So this is my favorite part of that interview. It's a short little part. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=610.88s)]
*  And it's gonna lead to my explanation of why Trump and Elon are gonna get caught. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=615.28s)]
*  Let's watch. A little murmuring in Maggaland about the comments about China today. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=619.12s)]
*  Yeah, a little murmuring in Maggaland, okay? Okay, I mean, I don't wanna say told you, but there it is. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=628.4s)]
*  So and that's just the beginning. I wanna hear the howls because I can't begin to tell you how [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=635.44s)]
*  much I agree with them on this issue. Yeah, and so look on our popular spline, tyt.com. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=640.64s)]
*  A private equity shouldn't be able to buy our houses. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=646.16s)]
*  Damn right. Because it drives up housing prices and makes it unaffordable for us. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=650.16s)]
*  Also true of China and Saudi Arabia and other countries that are buying up tons of houses. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=654.4799999999999s)]
*  Yes. Okay, so now, why do I think they're gonna get caught? One is the media is different than [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=659.8399999999999s)]
*  it was before, guys. It's not like, yeah, but right wing media is lovely now. No, no, no, no, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=665.76s)]
*  but it's diverse now. They all have slightly different interests and they might all be [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  right wing but they're coming at it from different right wing positions. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=675.44s)]
*  And libertarian positions and some positions that are like, wait, that's so popular. I'm not even [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=678.96s)]
*  sure that's right wing. That sounds exactly like Bernie, right? And so there in the old days, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=683.6800000000001s)]
*  there was no pointing going on right wing shows. Why didn't I do it before? Because it's just [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=689.2s)]
*  talking point after talking point. And I could tell you exactly what they were gonna say before [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=692.96s)]
*  I went on their shows. Because they were all saying the same exact thing Sean Hannity said. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=697.12s)]
*  Fox News had a monopoly on right wing media. So everyone sounded like they had just watched [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=701.68s)]
*  Sean Hannity, right? Now when I go on their shows, they're disagreeing with each other. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=707.12s)]
*  They're disagreeing with other right wing hosts. And then I told you, look, you got the bros [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=712.4s)]
*  who are not even MAGA and who are not even necessarily Republicans at all, like Dave [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  Portnoy. And today, Dave Portnoy scathing comments about Trump administration and what the hell is [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  going on here? And none of the things we were promised is happening. So you think you're gonna [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=728.56s)]
*  contain the bros? They don't even have any alliance. They don't have any loyalty. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=733.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So those are the unwheely, it's kind of actually exciting to hear [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=737.8399999999999s)]
*  real pushback against what Trump is doing. Because again, look, any other politician, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=745.1999999999999s)]
*  especially when you compare what happened in Trump's first term, right? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  It felt like no one was ever willing to admit that he had reneged on his promises when he would [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=754.48s)]
*  renege on his promises. This time around, it is different. You are- [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=760.0s)]
*  It's definitely different. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=764.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I like that. It's necessary. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=764.72s)]
*  God, I was so right. Okay, so hold on, hold on. I gotta get to the second part. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=765.72s)]
*  So look, so you've got the different kinds of media and you're not gonna be able to continue. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  Rokin endorsed Bernie Sanders back in 2016. He has no alliance to all the other apparatus of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=774.08s)]
*  the Republican Party and the corruption, etc. So now, in the old days, Fox News would drive the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=782.16s)]
*  message and then MAGA would receive the message or Republicans would receive the message and they [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=788.48s)]
*  would regurgitate it. Now, because the media is so diversified and split up into different parts, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=793.28s)]
*  now MAGA is driving the message and Fox News is repeating it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=801.52s)]
*  It's totally flipped on its head. That's why Laura Ingraham, who loved the Pentagon and thought we [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=806.72s)]
*  should do infinite defense spending, a couple of months ago did a segment about what are we [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=812.64s)]
*  gonna cut defense? In fact, she did another one today, I mean last night, about what the hell, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  when are we gonna cut defense, right? So you think Fox News wanted to cut defense? No. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=821.04s)]
*  Now they're all talking about, the Iraq War is terrible. That's the same Fox News that was like, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=826.72s)]
*  Iraq War is the greatest thing in the world and anyone who disagrees is a commie pig, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=830.48s)]
*  Now they're telling you the Iraq War was a disaster and Dick Cheney was a disaster. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=834.8s)]
*  So now they're challenging China on this and that and the other thing. It's because [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=839.04s)]
*  MAGA is murmuring and now they're driving the agenda. And it doesn't mean that MAGA's angels, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=843.52s)]
*  some of the agenda for us on the left will hate, especially on some social issues. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=849.76s)]
*  But on some of the economic issues and some of the corruption issues, here we are where they're [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=854.8s)]
*  going, wait, I thought we were against China buying us. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=859.52s)]
*  Yeah, and look, for people who are against it, they're correct. For those who are not against it, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=862.96s)]
*  they are incorrect. And the reason why they're incorrect is because [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=868.32s)]
*  real estate should be purchased by American citizens, especially housing related real estate. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=873.6s)]
*  And if you wanna know what the numbers are, let's go to the first graphic here. Chinese companies [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=877.84s)]
*  have spent well over $100 billion acquiring US companies since 2010, many of which will have [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=881.84s)]
*  owned real estate holdings. The National Association of Realtors, for example, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=888.64s)]
*  reported that during 2020, Chinese buyers were the top foreign buyers of US commercial real estate. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=893.04s)]
*  And by the way, that wasn't just the case in 2020. Chinese buyers have led foreign investments [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=902.0s)]
*  in US homes for the past seven years. Why are they buying homes in the United States? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=908.24s)]
*  In 2019 through 2020, they bought US home properties worth $11.5 billion or [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=915.12s)]
*  little more than a sixth of the total. They bought a sixth of the total in home sales [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=921.92s)]
*  in that year. That's unacceptable. That's freaking unacceptable, okay? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=929.92s)]
*  It's unacceptable. And I love it when people come at me like, you're being bigoted. I don't care [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=935.28s)]
*  about whether it's China. I don't care if it's Armenia. If Armenia was some rich country and [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=940.96s)]
*  was able to spend that kind of money buying up homes in the United States that they have no [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=945.9200000000001s)]
*  intention in living in, but are robbing the American people the opportunity of having to buy, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=950.48s)]
*  I wouldn't be okay with that. I would not be okay with that. This has nothing to do with bigotry. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=955.2s)]
*  It has to do with the fact that Americans continue to get fleeced by our own government, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=959.52s)]
*  inviting foreign investments into our own country and essentially screwing over American citizens. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  That's not okay. Yeah, my kids are Chinese. My wife is Chinese. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=968.16s)]
*  It's not hateful to say, hey, the Chinese government or Chinese citizens, my kids and [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=974.9599999999999s)]
*  my wife are American citizens, obviously, shouldn't be able to buy property. You can [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=981.1999999999999s)]
*  debate that issue, but it's not about China. Same thing would apply to Saudi Arabia and Russia and [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=985.76s)]
*  whoever else. Even Italy. Even the lovely Italians. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=991.76s)]
*  I love the Italians, man. I love them a lot, okay? I want to one day live with them, among them. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=995.76s)]
*  However, I don't want them buying up American homes. Sorry. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay, so again, you could debate that issue, but it has nothing to do with race and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1003.76s)]
*  allowing them to do this for favors, etc. For whoever the donors are that Laura Ingram is [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1008.48s)]
*  referring to is not populism at all. It's the exact opposite. Look, when Trump was in last time, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1013.28s)]
*  Fox News still had the monopoly. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1021.84s)]
*  So what did he do? He came in, passed giant corporate tax cuts and did almost nothing else, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1023.52s)]
*  okay? So this time he thought he's gonna do the same playbook. Last time he stuffed his cabinet [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1028.24s)]
*  full of Goldman Sachs guys. This time he's brought in tons of billionaires. So from Goldman Sachs to [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1032.48s)]
*  Elon Sachs. But either way, he's doing the same exact playbook and what is the first thing? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1038.64s)]
*  Guys, everything else is distractions other than the budget. The budget is real. That's where the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1044.16s)]
*  money is. That's where the action is. And what did they just propose this week? Four and a half [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1048.96s)]
*  trillion dollars in tax cuts for rich and corporations just like he did in his first term. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1053.44s)]
*  And increased defense spending by $100 billion. So back to the same exact corporate playbook [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1058.4s)]
*  and they think they're not going to get caught, but they are. And they're gonna get caught by [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1065.68s)]
*  their own voters, let alone the rest of us. And this time it's gonna be super interesting [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1070.72s)]
*  to see what happens when they do get caught. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1076.72s)]
*  By the way, I misspoke. I just wanna clarify. So when I mentioned a sixth of the housing was [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1078.8000000000002s)]
*  purchased in that year, it wasn't just by China. It was foreign investors overall. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1085.2s)]
*  So let's ban all of them. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnzKTa93iY&t=1089.1200000000001s)]
