"CNBC host Jim Cramer said if President Donald Trump continues on the same path, the stock market dive could turn into a genuine ‚Äúcrash.‚Äù

The stock market dropped like a boulder as soon as the opening bell rang Thursday morning after Trump announced his tariff program, and closed almost 1700 points in the hole ‚Äî and that was before China announced reciprocal tariffs that sent futures crashing again. But Trump, in comments to reporters on the North Lawn and aboard Air Force One Thursday afternoon, projected success."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Markets PLUNGE, Republicans PANIC Over Trump's Tariffs
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4)
*  I'm not gonna bubble wrap it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=0.0s)]
*  What's happening is not good. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1.84s)]
*  Now, will it continue? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=3.6s)]
*  Will we find the bottom and then it will start to go back up? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=5.72s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=9.28s)]
*  The markets are down about 8% in just two days. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=10.28s)]
*  And I'm getting all kinds of reaction from businesses, farmers in Wisconsin that are [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=13.36s)]
*  highly concerned about what's happening. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=18.44s)]
*  So those are the facts. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=19.94s)]
*  Yeah, those are the facts and at least a couple of Republican senators can point that out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=21.92s)]
*  Actually slightly more than a couple. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=26.64s)]
*  We have a third, I guess that's progress. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=29.3s)]
*  Rand Paul has also been speaking out against it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=31.94s)]
*  In fact, he wrote an op-ed for Fox titled Terminate the Trump Tariffs Before It's Too [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=33.86s)]
*  Late. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=38.9s)]
*  It's pretty clear and it reads in part, tariffs are not just bad for American families and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=39.9s)]
*  the national economy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=43.82s)]
*  Tariffs are also bad for Republicans. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=45.28s)]
*  The McKinley Tariff of 1890 caused such a spike in prices that the Republican Party [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=46.86s)]
*  lost nearly 100 seats in the House. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=50.38s)]
*  And by the end of the next election, the House, the Senate and the White House were all in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  Democratic hands. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  And of course, we saw a version of that in the first Trump term and he hadn't even totally [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=58.5s)]
*  tanked the economy to get to that point. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  So I understand why Rand Paul would be a little bit worried here, particularly when they're [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=65.94s)]
*  not hypothesizing about something that could maybe happen in a week or a month or in a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=70.4s)]
*  year. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=74.10000000000001s)]
*  We're watching it every moment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=75.10000000000001s)]
*  As of just today, stocks dropped for the second straight day. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=77.58s)]
*  The Dow Jones was down another 2200 points or about 5.5%. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=81.30000000000001s)]
*  The drop ended the worst trading week since March 2020. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=87.46s)]
*  I don't know why they marked March 2020. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=92.0s)]
*  Was anything big happening then? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=94.2s)]
*  I don't really remember that time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=95.44s)]
*  Maybe there was something significant that affected the economy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=96.96s)]
*  But the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 also closed down 5.8% and 5.9%. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=99.64s)]
*  And I want everyone to remember, while this week has been devastating for the stock market, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=105.4s)]
*  it's not like the year so far has been great. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=109.96s)]
*  We've already had minor shocks every other time Trump implied he'd be doing tariffs like [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=111.96s)]
*  this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure Jake, the numbers don't look great. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=116.48s)]
*  Yeah, and they're never gonna look great cuz this is dumb. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=118.08s)]
*  So we'll explain why it's dumb. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=122.12s)]
*  The question isn't whether the tariff or not the tariff. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=124.48s)]
*  The question is how do you do it and this ain't it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  And so I'll tell you what we'll talk about what went wrong and what I think is going [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=131.24s)]
*  to happen next because this is untenable. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=136.44s)]
*  They can't have the stock market drop 1000 to 2000 points every day. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=140.86s)]
*  And be like, no, we're fine. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=146.32s)]
*  We're fine. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=147.68s)]
*  Nothing's wrong here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=148.68s)]
*  And we have a poll for you guys. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=149.68s)]
*  Were you expecting Republicans to come out against these tariffs? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=152.2s)]
*  Yes or no, that's in the live chat. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  Curious what you guys think. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=156.92s)]
*  That's an easy one for me. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=159.88s)]
*  I said that a lot of people on the right would come out against Trump in a thousand different [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  ways in this term. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=165.48s)]
*  I was told that that was impossible. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=167.24s)]
*  And no Republican would ever come out against Trump on any issue. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=169.56s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=174.12s)]
*  Well, looks like there's plenty, John. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=175.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would love for them to have stopped him the way they did the first term. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=177.44s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=181.16s)]
*  They were actually largely successful there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=182.16s)]
*  But yeah, maybe it's the beginning of something. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you've got three now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=185.24s)]
*  That's something potentially you can build on, especially as the stock market gets worse, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=186.66s)]
*  maybe. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=190.08s)]
*  Yeah, and just look, there's more. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=191.08s)]
*  There's like among the influencers, there's Dave Portnoy and many others. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=193.0s)]
*  We'll get to all that too. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=196.88s)]
*  But what John just said there is super important. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  That's why you jumped back in. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=200.0s)]
*  Look, guys, in a little bit, I'm gonna tell you guys about why things are so off the rails [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=201.36s)]
*  now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=206.52s)]
*  Versus the first Trump term where there was a thousand things wrong, but the economy didn't [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=207.52s)]
*  collapse in the first three years. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=210.72s)]
*  What's the difference maker? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=212.64s)]
*  That's in this story. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=213.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=214.84s)]
*  John, go ahead. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=215.84s)]
*  Well, we will later get to people who are speaking out in support of this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=216.84s)]
*  But a lot of those, even those that you might have expected would, because that's kind of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=219.7s)]
*  like what their job is, aren't choosing to do so. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=223.16s)]
*  And we're gonna begin with, I think, a perfect example of that, which is Scott Jennings. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=226.22s)]
*  He firmly believes in it and he firmly believes in making this bet. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=230.12s)]
*  I mean, he's betting his presidency on this issue, which is probably the most closely [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  and longest held political and economic belief that he's ever had. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=238.4s)]
*  He's been talking about doing it for four years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=241.8s)]
*  You think it's a good bet? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=242.8s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=243.8s)]
*  If it's right, it'll be the ballsyest thing that ever happened. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=244.8s)]
*  And if it's wrong, the consequences will fall on one shoulder. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=246.84s)]
*  Yeah, except no. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=249.68s)]
*  I mean, yeah, sure, I guess they'll fall on his shoulders. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=251.24s)]
*  But his shoulders are barely gonna be staying upright for that much longer. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=253.24s)]
*  It's not really much of a risk when it's his presidency, sure, but it's his last term that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=256.38s)]
*  he can serve. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=260.26s)]
*  And he probably won't survive past that point for much longer. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=261.54s)]
*  The consequences are gonna fall on tens of millions of shoulders. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=264.9s)]
*  They already are. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=268.58s)]
*  People's 401Ks being decimated, businesses going under, people losing their jobs. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=269.7s)]
*  Scott Jennings, even here where he's exercising a little bit of independence from Donald Trump, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=274.26s)]
*  still seems to only have eyes for Donald Trump and not for the many people, the many conservatives, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=278.46s)]
*  the many Trump voters who are going to and indeed are already losing everything. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=282.58s)]
*  Thanks to Donald Trump, you could spin it as he did as ideological attachment to the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  idea of tariffs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=292.09999999999997s)]
*  I might present it as the increasingly deranged, deluded, deteriorating brain of a guy who [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  doesn't know to listen to all of those around him telling him it's a terrible idea. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=300.02s)]
*  But either way, that's Scott Jennings. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=303.97999999999996s)]
*  And we'll discuss in a sec. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=305.78s)]
*  We're gonna go to a few more people in Fox Business and CNBC who normally are pretty [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=306.78s)]
*  defensive towards Donald Trump, maybe not in this case. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=311.34s)]
*  Are in disbelief and don't think that a Peter Navarro, for instance, who's a very fine man [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  or a Besant wouldn't go in, maybe a Ludwig, we can go to the presidency. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=319.82s)]
*  Look, we don't really wanna crash. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=324.73999999999995s)]
*  You don't wanna be as hardline. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=327.06s)]
*  Maybe you do the TikTok deal. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=328.46s)]
*  Maybe you say, look, but here's a way to cure things, which was the way that Nvidia did [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=330.7s)]
*  with Taiwan. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=335.5s)]
*  But they could have a crash. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=336.5s)]
*  I don't see why not. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=338.46s)]
*  I mean, why would you buy stocks? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=339.46s)]
*  Let us hope that the cooler heads do prevail. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=342.58s)]
*  When time shall tell, and eventually the cooler heads will prevail. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=344.73999999999995s)]
*  But for right now, cooler heads are not prevailing right now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=348.62s)]
*  Angry heads are prevailing. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=351.62s)]
*  And right now, circumstances are prevailing that send stock prices much lower than where [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=352.62s)]
*  they are right now. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=357.78s)]
*  What the market is worried about is what's gonna happen in the future. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=358.78s)]
*  Who's gonna hire now in this uncertain environment? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=362.29999999999995s)]
*  I think people are very, very concerned. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=364.7s)]
*  And that's why, again, we need to get to work. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=367.14s)]
*  We need to act on negotiating now. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=370.34s)]
*  We need to get tax cuts now. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=372.09999999999997s)]
*  We need to get deregulation now to make a difference before this gets out of control [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  the other way. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=379.02s)]
*  Again, literally handing billions of dollars to the richest people. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=380.5s)]
*  What is that going to do to stimulate the economy at this point? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=384.53999999999996s)]
*  People aren't gonna have money. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=387.38s)]
*  They're not gonna be buying anything. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=388.38s)]
*  Thus, less products will be sold, less services will be rendered. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=389.38s)]
*  Jobs will have to be cut as a result of it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=392.58s)]
*  And thanks to the reciprocal tariffs, which we're already seeing from China, 34% on the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=394.66s)]
*  things we'd normally sell to them, jobs are gonna be lost. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=398.98s)]
*  Elon Musk having an extra $20 billion isn't gonna save the economy. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=401.86s)]
*  And so obviously, they're gonna spin it the way they are. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=407.14000000000004s)]
*  But it's pretty clear from Fox and from the business network there that they don't see [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=409.44000000000005s)]
*  much good coming out of this in the short term. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, think about it from China and other folks we trade with, their [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=415.62s)]
*  perspective. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=422.1s)]
*  So a lot of times, some of the smaller players and even some mid-sized players panicked [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=423.1s)]
*  over the tariff threats in the first term and in the beginning of this term, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=427.82000000000005s)]
*  Now they're not doing that at all. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=433.02000000000004s)]
*  They're doing the exact opposite. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=434.02000000000004s)]
*  They're like, you wanna play? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=435.02000000000004s)]
*  Okay, then we'll go reciprocal on you because remember, Trump didn't go reciprocal. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=436.02000000000004s)]
*  He did this weird calculation where you take the trade deficit and divide it by imports, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  made up, ludicrous. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  That's why the numbers are so freaking high. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=448.36s)]
*  So China's like, okay, so you went nuclear, then I'll go nuclear. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=450.42s)]
*  And they did. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=453.66s)]
*  And then that crashed the market worse cuz it was like a tiny bit of recovery until China [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=454.66s)]
*  said we'll match what Trump's doing. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=458.18s)]
*  Now it's not like the Chinese can't see our stock market. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=460.66s)]
*  They see it crashing. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  It's not like they can't see our media. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  They see everybody panicking, right? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=467.3s)]
*  So then they double down on this, which is logical. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=469.3s)]
*  Then Europe was gonna do the same thing. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=472.1s)]
*  Canada, Mexico are gonna do the same thing. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=473.58000000000004s)]
*  The whole world's gonna do the same thing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=476.0s)]
*  So you think they're gonna cave into Trump now? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=478.08s)]
*  No, they got him on the ropes. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=481.32s)]
*  But more than that, they have us on the ropes because this was dumb. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=483.56s)]
*  So we've talked about this now for over a week. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=488.28s)]
*  You do targeted tariffs if you wanna build up manufacturing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=490.46s)]
*  You do it particular to an industry. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=493.64s)]
*  You do knowing that you're gonna have to do it for two, three, five, or ten years, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=495.64s)]
*  And if you really are planning to do these type of nuclear tariffs for five to ten years, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=499.88s)]
*  there'll be no economy left. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=504.64s)]
*  There'll be no global trade left. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=506.78s)]
*  This is mental. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=508.62s)]
*  It makes no sense at all. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=510.52s)]
*  So I'm gonna get to why they're doing this in a second. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=512.16s)]
*  So now, since they don't have any incentive to compromise at all, how are we gonna get [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=515.2s)]
*  out of this mess? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=522.86s)]
*  So there's folks on the right who really believe, no, no, everything's gonna be fine. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=524.3s)]
*  Totally fine. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  Like the markets, guys, the stock market's not the relevant thing. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=530.9399999999999s)]
*  The stock market for me is a leading indicator in this case. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=535.42s)]
*  Because when the stock market does that, a lot of people are gonna get fired because [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=538.9799999999999s)]
*  the companies don't have as much money anymore. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's not targeted towards a bad guy industry, like the health insurance companies, their [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=546.02s)]
*  whole business model's to rob us. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=550.74s)]
*  So if they got hit on the stock market, I wouldn't care at all, right? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=552.5s)]
*  I'd wanna have a transition plan for the people who work in that industry, right? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=557.38s)]
*  That's what thoughtful people do. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=561.5s)]
*  That's what people who I believe in strategy do, right? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=563.06s)]
*  They don't just go in like, let's do a dare for everyone, like a million percent, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=565.7399999999999s)]
*  And so you right-wingers, you really think that he's gonna keep these tariffs for the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=572.8599999999999s)]
*  whole four years? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=579.26s)]
*  I can't believe you guys think that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=580.26s)]
*  That's not even close to true. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=582.3399999999999s)]
*  I think he'd be lucky to keep it for four days. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=583.66s)]
*  And the reason why we're showing a clip after clip of Republicans saying this is because [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=586.5s)]
*  that's the whole freaking plan. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=590.7399999999999s)]
*  But they're worried that this panic is too bad and that there's going to be irreversible [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=592.66s)]
*  damages, John is saying. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=598.14s)]
*  Cuz the plan was to hold these stupid tariffs into place until they pass the tax cuts. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=599.54s)]
*  And after they rob us of now, it used to be four and a half, now it's five and a half [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=605.42s)]
*  trillion dollars. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=608.62s)]
*  Then they're gonna go, yeah, we got what we wanted out of the tariffs. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=610.26s)]
*  And everybody caved into us based on nothing, based on like, Panama said they'd give us [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=613.3s)]
*  a needle and a thread back. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=618.86s)]
*  We win, we win, Trump won. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=621.44s)]
*  So he's gonna withdraw the tariffs. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=624.44s)]
*  There's no way these tariffs stay in place for years. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=625.44s)]
*  You can quote me on that, you can bring back this video. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  If they stay in place for two, three years, rub it in my face. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=630.36s)]
*  If they work, my God, it should be totally discredited. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=633.44s)]
*  And say, okay, three years from now, you see that, Cenk? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=636.12s)]
*  The market rebounded, the economy was great, we rebuilt manufacturing. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=640.12s)]
*  He kept it in place and it worked. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=644.96s)]
*  If it did, then I don't know anything and you shouldn't watch, okay? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=646.6s)]
*  There's a 0% chance that's going to happen. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=650.16s)]
*  I think that there's only a microscopic chance these tariffs last past the tax cuts. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=653.16s)]
*  So I'm super on the record on that. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=661.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm all over the place, the right wing is like, you're nuts, no way, man, they're doing [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=664.0s)]
*  it for our best interest. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, okay, I know. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=669.48s)]
*  You know what they think about the tax cuts now? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=671.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a different topic, but it's super related to this. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  These poor guys, they think they're getting their income tax eliminated. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=676.4s)]
*  Tons of them think that the income tax for people making under $150,000 is going to be [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=680.72s)]
*  eliminated. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=685.6s)]
*  That's what they think the five and a half trillion is for. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=686.92s)]
*  They're going to have a rude awakening. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=689.12s)]
*  None of that is going to happen. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=692.52s)]
*  Take it to the bank, you're going to eliminate income tax for people under $150,000. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=695.6800000000001s)]
*  What planet are you guys on? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=700.4s)]
*  Why would you believe such insanity? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=702.6s)]
*  So okay, but the reason why I'm so confident is because we're all going to see with our [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=705.58s)]
*  own eyes. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=709.62s)]
*  You're going to get to see where the majority of those tax cuts go. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=710.86s)]
*  You're going to get to see if they really lower corporate taxes again to a ridiculously [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=713.74s)]
*  low 15%. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=718.58s)]
*  You're going to see with your own eyes, are they really in it for the average guy and [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=720.0600000000001s)]
*  they're going to take down the taxes for the average guy, but they're going to increase [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=724.0200000000001s)]
*  taxes on the rich. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=726.74s)]
*  They have that theory. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=728.3000000000001s)]
*  You think they're going to increase taxes on the rich. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=729.3000000000001s)]
*  That's what you think. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=734.1s)]
*  Okay, I love you guys. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=735.1s)]
*  No, that's not going to happen. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=736.5400000000001s)]
*  So look, everybody gets deluded. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=738.78s)]
*  Everybody's in their own bubble. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=740.46s)]
*  So, but why this like, okay, here, we got two quick things that I got to get to you [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=741.46s)]
*  guys. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=746.62s)]
*  But in fact, I'll save these. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=747.62s)]
*  Let me save these and why this is happening and some of the more right wing reaction. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=748.62s)]
*  But yes, what do you think? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=753.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I think I know what you're about to get at, Cenk. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=755.0600000000001s)]
*  But I don't understand, first of all, why anyone would elect a hot headed president [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=758.38s)]
*  in the hopes that cooler heads will prevail. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=762.74s)]
*  Because what if that hot head gets his way and if those cooler heads are too cool to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=765.1s)]
*  actually do anything about it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=769.1800000000001s)]
*  But there is so much to unpack here with these terrorists. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=771.26s)]
*  First, whatever reasons Trump or his Republican supporters are giving us right now all these [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=773.74s)]
*  talking heads on Fox News as to why Trump is imposing these terrorists. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=778.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to say I think they're just straight up lying to us about what their actual motives [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=783.0600000000001s)]
*  are here. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=786.98s)]
*  He's not doing this because he thinks it'll make America great in the long term whenever [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=788.32s)]
*  that is. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=792.4599999999999s)]
*  He's not doing it because he wants manufacturing jobs to come back to this country. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=793.4599999999999s)]
*  Because as Cenk just pointed out, if that was his actual goal, he would have gone about [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=797.3s)]
*  all of this very differently in a much more strategic and targeted way. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=801.66s)]
*  And he's not doing it because he thinks the US will somehow, that we're getting the raw [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=805.8399999999999s)]
*  end of all these deals that we have with our allies and that we're being bullied by them. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=810.5799999999999s)]
*  He's doing this because of what he said on Truth Social. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=816.0999999999999s)]
*  He and other billionaires will make money off of this, right? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=819.6600000000001s)]
*  The wealth will flow upward, further, even more than it already is, while the rest of [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=822.62s)]
*  us continue to struggle to buy our groceries. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=827.0200000000001s)]
*  The stock market looks bad now, well, maybe, but not if you're a billionaire. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=829.4200000000001s)]
*  It's an investor's market, right? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=834.32s)]
*  This is a great time to get rich in this country. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=836.0200000000001s)]
*  That's what he said on Truth Social. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=838.5400000000001s)]
*  What he didn't say is that it's a great time to get rich in this country if you are already [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=840.4200000000001s)]
*  rich. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=844.4200000000001s)]
*  It's a great time to get even more rich than you already are. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=845.94s)]
*  And keep in mind, he's only just announced these tariffs and the markets are already [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=849.24s)]
*  responding. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=853.1600000000001s)]
*  Not only that, but other nations are responding. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=854.2s)]
*  They're announcing retaliatory tariffs against us. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=856.44s)]
*  So it will be interesting to see if he just cancels everything before any of it actually [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=859.5200000000001s)]
*  goes into effect. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=863.1400000000001s)]
*  Because what he's doing is manipulating the markets, and he's doing so on a very irresponsible [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=864.2s)]
*  global scale, to the point that there's so much uncertainty nobody knows how to proceed [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=868.76s)]
*  with anything. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=873.2800000000001s)]
*  Also, the talking point that we had been hearing about these tariffs up until now from people [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=874.2800000000001s)]
*  who are supporting or at least trying to defend the moves of this administration was [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=879.08s)]
*  that Trump was only threatening to issue these tariffs because he was using the threat of [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=883.44s)]
*  tariffs as bargaining chips. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=887.76s)]
*  We've seen that many Americans who voted for Trump never actually believed that he would [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=890.12s)]
*  go through with the tariffs. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=893.96s)]
*  And they voted for him because somehow they thought he was going to make their grocery [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=895.6s)]
*  store bill and how much money they're paying on gas to go down. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=899.8000000000001s)]
*  And they thought that he would use these threats, not the actual tariffs, just the threats, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  to gain concessions from other countries. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=908.5999999999999s)]
*  Mexico was going to block their immigrants from coming from their country into ours. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=910.7199999999999s)]
*  And Canada was finally going to get a hold of all their pesky drug cartels that are flooding [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=915.16s)]
*  all this fentanyl into the country. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=920.88s)]
*  But in Trump's other social posts, we see that he's actually trying to bargain with [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=923.3199999999999s)]
*  Jerome Powell. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=927.9399999999999s)]
*  He's not, whatever he's bargaining for, it's not meant or intended to actually benefit [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=928.9399999999999s)]
*  the everyday working class American. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=933.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republicans are scrambling to either explain Trump's actions away or break with [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=936.28s)]
*  him entirely. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=940.52s)]
*  Because especially for the Republicans and especially right now, the economics of this [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=941.88s)]
*  tariff rollout and the politics of it are inseparable. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=946.04s)]
*  They're directly tied to one another and Republicans are rightly worried that this could all come [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=949.28s)]
*  back to bite them in a very unsavory place very soon. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=953.98s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=958.36s)]
*  By the way, let's note for the record that my curious products that Panama would give [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=959.36s)]
*  back to us was a needle in a thread. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=964.66s)]
*  Okay, that's what happens when you do a live show. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=966.62s)]
*  Yeah, maybe three empanadas. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=969.26s)]
*  All right, so to Tiaz's point, it's a great time to invest. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=970.9s)]
*  Yeah, if you're already a millionaire sitting on a lot of cash. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=974.6999999999999s)]
*  Are we all in that situation? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=978.74s)]
*  So yeah, Warren Buffett, by the way, there's another story in the rundown we'll get to [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=980.54s)]
*  where they're pretending that Warren Buffett is on Trump's side and thinks tariffs are [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=984.4599999999999s)]
*  a great idea. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=987.86s)]
*  Of course, as usual, exact opposite. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=988.9399999999999s)]
*  So Warren Buffett said that he was holding a couple of months ago. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=991.18s)]
*  He's like, I'm withdrawing and going all cash because the tariffs will obviously crash [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=994.34s)]
*  the market. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=998.7s)]
*  Then I'll come in and buy a lot. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=999.7s)]
*  That's because he has hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1001.0600000000001s)]
*  We don't, okay? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1003.7800000000001s)]
*  So- [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1004.7800000000001s)]
*  Speak for yourself. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1005.7800000000001s)]
*  Okay, well, I don't know, maybe John's got something I don't know about. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1006.7800000000001s)]
*  All right, so the right wing cult, no Trump voters ever gonna break with him. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1009.1800000000001s)]
*  Let's see how that turned out for Dave Portnoy. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1016.26s)]
*  It's Tariff City. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1018.46s)]
*  Trump has put his tariffs all over the place. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1020.94s)]
*  I've been trying to understand them. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1024.18s)]
*  I don't, like it's more a trade deficit tariff to me. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1025.54s)]
*  Like hey, we get this much from you and you get this much from us. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1031.6200000000001s)]
*  Let's even that up. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1036.42s)]
*  Let's get some wacky formula new tariffs. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1037.78s)]
*  And everything's in the because of it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1041.38s)]
*  I almost tweeted out, Dave, how much you down right now and today? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1043.38s)]
*  7 million. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1047.66s)]
*  I'm down 7 million bucks in stocks and crypto. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1049.06s)]
*  You know what will break a cult losing $7 million in a day. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1053.3s)]
*  Okay, so but look, that's my contention was that they are not a cult. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1056.34s)]
*  I know in 2016, they did not break with Trump. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1060.7s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1063.7s)]
*  Because they all watch Fox News. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1064.7s)]
*  They all watch the same media. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1065.7s)]
*  Now if you're a Trump supporter watching Dave Portnoy, are you super happy with Trump? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1067.54s)]
*  No, it doesn't look like you are, right? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1072.78s)]
*  So that's why none of this is gonna last. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1074.3799999999999s)]
*  In the old days, maybe it had a chance of lasting despite the economic meltdown because [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1077.34s)]
*  Fox News would just enforce the talking point. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1082.26s)]
*  No, everything is great. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1084.6200000000001s)]
*  An economy is better when it crashes, right? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1086.06s)]
*  And people do believe that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1088.6200000000001s)]
*  But nowadays, even certainly independence and a lot of right wingers are going, no, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1090.04s)]
*  I saw on an independent show or I saw on a bro show or I saw it on another show. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1094.92s)]
*  That it turns out the economy is not great when it crashes. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1098.94s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1102.14s)]
*  Okay, so last thing for me for now. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1103.14s)]
*  So why this crazy plan? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1107.9s)]
*  He had a bunch of crazy ideas in the first term. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1112.8200000000002s)]
*  He thought we should increase our nuclear arsenal tenfold, which would have literally [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1116.22s)]
*  bankrupted the country, right? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1120.64s)]
*  And so they of course they didn't do that because that's absurd, right? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1122.5s)]
*  Well, as an explanation in the Washington Post, which is that he's not listening to [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1126.14s)]
*  anyone. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1131.94s)]
*  And there are no establishment figures. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1132.94s)]
*  There are no other figures. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1134.6000000000001s)]
*  No one but Trump supporters inside the Trump administration now. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1136.42s)]
*  Because they all need, what was the number one litmus test that they had? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1140.86s)]
*  Not if you're a right wing, not if you're a populist, not if any of those things. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1144.3s)]
*  Only litmus test was, are you a Trump loyalist? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1147.5s)]
*  So now when Trump says something, no one questions him. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1149.98s)]
*  So they explained that in the first term, they had a lot of debates back and forth. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1153.16s)]
*  And they could stop a lot of things. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1157.78s)]
*  Now what did I tell you guys? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1158.86s)]
*  In the first term, the establishment, as much as I hate them, were the brakes in the car [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1161.02s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1166.02s)]
*  They were actually helpful in the Trump administration, okay? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1167.02s)]
*  A rare case where they're helpful. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1169.98s)]
*  Without the brakes in the car, Trump's a moron. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1172.1399999999999s)]
*  That didn't change overnight. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1175.98s)]
*  And this great thing where somebody says, this actually happens regularly. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1177.3s)]
*  What would you know, man? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1181.02s)]
*  You're a stupid podcaster. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1182.46s)]
*  Trump's a genius who went to warden. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1183.46s)]
*  People who went to warden, no. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1185.94s)]
*  I'm like, inconvenient fact for you. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1187.6599999999999s)]
*  I also went to warden. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1189.7s)]
*  So now we're at a stalemate, okay? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1190.7s)]
*  We're both geniuses. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1193.18s)]
*  No, we're not geniuses, okay? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1194.18s)]
*  The guy doesn't know what the hell he's doing. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1195.8600000000001s)]
*  He says, dad got him into patent, okay? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1197.14s)]
*  Please, please, he has no earthly idea what he's doing. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1199.14s)]
*  So here's the quote, senior White House official. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  In the first term, everyone thought they were president. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1204.42s)]
*  So what that means is like, they were weighing in with their opinions and facts and information. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1208.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, we got rid of those idiots, okay? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1214.22s)]
*  And they explain that they would propose a tariff, they're his staff would, which is [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1217.14s)]
*  what they're supposed to do for every particular country. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1221.0600000000002s)]
*  And then Trump would go, no, I want this one. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1224.14s)]
*  And there'd be no more debate. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1226.3400000000001s)]
*  And that's it, that's the tariff. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1227.9s)]
*  And so before the Rose Garden, they had this big long meeting, JD Vance, etc. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1229.74s)]
*  Did anybody question Trump? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1233.5s)]
*  No, they're all too scared to question Trump, because the only thing he wants is loyalty. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1234.5s)]
*  If you question him, he's gonna fire you. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1238.66s)]
*  So they're like, yes, sir, nuclear tariffs that would destroy the world economy. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1240.38s)]
*  That's a great idea, Mr. President. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1245.34s)]
*  And when you have a bunch of idiots like that, next to the chief idiot, this is what's going [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1248.1799999999998s)]
*  to happen. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg3AnLzfJi4&t=1252.4199999999998s)]
