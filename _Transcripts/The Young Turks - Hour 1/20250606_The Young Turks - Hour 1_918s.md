"Newsmax host Carl Higbie asked Elon Musk on Thursday why he let his four-year-old son board Marine One with President Donald Trump if he supposedly knew Trump was in the late serial sex offender Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs files.
Musk made headlines on Thursday after he accused President Trump of being ‚Äúin the Epstein files,‚Äù as the two men traded insults and jabs."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# The Truth About Trump And Epstein May Be Worse Than You Think
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4)
*  Again, not taking a side here, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=0.0s)]
*  still love Trump and [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=2.04s)]
*  I really like Elon. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  This is just a really crappy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=5.12s)]
*  scenario right now and I really [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=6.44s)]
*  hope these two can patch these [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=8.02s)]
*  things up. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=9.46s)]
*  Because I think Elon took a low [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=10.18s)]
*  blow by tweeting that quote, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=11.76s)]
*  DJT was on the Epstein client list. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=13.26s)]
*  If you knew he was on the Epstein [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=15.66s)]
*  client list, why did you let him [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=17.14s)]
*  board Marine One with your son? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=18.64s)]
*  Just asking. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=20.34s)]
*  All right, well as the fallout [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=22.62s)]
*  continues over Elon and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=24.42s)]
*  Donald's breakup, many are still [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=25.72s)]
*  trying to wrap their heads around [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk's bombshell claim that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  Trump was on Epstein's client list. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=32.16s)]
*  So in the midst of yesterday's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=35.04s)]
*  battle of the blowhards, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=37.0s)]
*  Musk posted this and says time to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=38.8s)]
*  drop the really big bomb. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=40.94s)]
*  Donald Trump is in the Epstein [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=43.04s)]
*  files. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=45.2s)]
*  That is the real reason they have [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=46.0s)]
*  not been made public. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=47.72s)]
*  Have a nice day, DJT. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  All right, Cenk, I know that you [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=51.4s)]
*  and Sharon kind of spoke about this [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=52.64s)]
*  a little bit yesterday. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=54.0s)]
*  But what do you think about that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=55.32s)]
*  clip that we just watched was kind [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=56.56s)]
*  of cringe? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=57.8s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, it was hilarious [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=59.12s)]
*  because now I like them both. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=60.4s)]
*  Please, please, my job is to do [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  propaganda for both. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=63.8s)]
*  I don't know what to do now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=64.84s)]
*  I'm so confused. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  Okay, I mean, they hate each other. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=67.16s)]
*  So it forces me to pick, but [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  I won't, I won't. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=70.96s)]
*  I'm paid to say I love Donald Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=72.36s)]
*  I'm also paid to say I love Elon [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=74.39999999999999s)]
*  Musk. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=75.72s)]
*  Okay, that was hilarious. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=76.32s)]
*  So this Epstein file thing is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=77.92s)]
*  really interesting though because [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=80.28s)]
*  I think Epstein, I'm sorry, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=83.0s)]
*  Elon Musk had that in his back [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=85.28s)]
*  pocket the whole time. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=87.56s)]
*  As I said in the first, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  I think he's been brewing over [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=90.44s)]
*  this budget for a long time because [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  it took out the electric vehicle [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=94.64s)]
*  subsidies. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=96.8s)]
*  And he didn't get a bunch of things [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=98.44s)]
*  that he wanted. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=99.96s)]
*  So he's been stewing in it, and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  he couldn't wait to drop that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=102.72s)]
*  Epstein line. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=104.44s)]
*  So he did, and now we've got [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=105.84s)]
*  the fallout from it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  We'll tell you what the Democrats [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=109.28s)]
*  are doing about it in a minute too. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=111.0s)]
*  But what I've seen online, guys, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=112.92s)]
*  is I've seen a lot of MAGA going, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  well, we really did want the Epstein [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=118.12s)]
*  files released, and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  they haven't been released. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  And it does make you wonder. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=126.0s)]
*  So that's why I love this fight, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  because they're airing their dirty [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  laundry, and their own side is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=132.32s)]
*  getting to see it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=134.28s)]
*  Yeah, from everything that came out [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=135.56s)]
*  from whatever happened yesterday, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=137.8s)]
*  the fallout from this claim [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  specifically has a lot of people in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=142.0s)]
*  the MAGA world very shocked. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=144.28s)]
*  They're unsure of how to react as [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  we just saw in that clip. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=147.36s)]
*  It even scared Alex Jones, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=148.56s)]
*  who simply tweeted this in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  response, God help us all. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  Not dramatic at all. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  All right, meanwhile, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=155.72s)]
*  Elon continued to tweet about [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=157.28s)]
*  the connections between Trump and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=159.08s)]
*  Epstein reposting an old MSNBC [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=161.32000000000002s)]

*  Epstein partying together at [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=165.22s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago in 1992. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=167.24s)]
*  That's nothing new though. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  We've all seen that clip a bunch of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=170.88s)]
*  times, we've seen those pictures. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=172.68s)]
*  And we have highlighted and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  reported on the relationship [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  between Trump and Epstein here on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=177.56s)]
*  this network many, many times. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=179.4s)]
*  So how do you know this? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  That was close to straight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=183.16s)]
*  Footage from 1992 found in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=186.20000000000002s)]

*  looking to distance himself from. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=210.12s)]
*  He was quoted in 2002 saying in New [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=212.16s)]
*  York Magazine, I've known Jeff for [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  15 years, terrific guy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=216.4s)]
*  He's a lot of fun to be with. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=217.96s)]
*  It is even said that he likes [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=220.8s)]
*  beautiful women as much as I do. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=222.28s)]
*  And many of them are on the younger [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=224.0s)]
*  side, which is just creepy in so [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=225.72s)]
*  many different ways. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=227.36s)]
*  All right, well, to be fair, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=229.44s)]
*  the evidence does show that Trump's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=231.2s)]
*  name is in Epstein's flight logs. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=233.2s)]
*  But as of right now, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=235.24s)]
*  there is no solid evidence of any [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=236.28s)]
*  wrongdoing on his part. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=238.0s)]
*  Still, people did not know how to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=239.24s)]
*  react to Elon's claim, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=241.2s)]
*  like Newsmax host Carl Higby, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=242.6s)]
*  who looked like he was about to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  cry over the news of the breakup [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=246.0s)]
*  last night. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=247.76s)]
*  Again, not taking a side here, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=249.2s)]
*  still love Trump and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=251.2s)]
*  I really like Elon. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=252.32s)]
*  This is just a really crappy [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=254.0s)]
*  scenario right now and I really [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=255.48s)]
*  hope these two can patch these [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=257.12s)]
*  things up because I think Elon took [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=258.72s)]
*  a blow by tweeting that quote, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=260.64s)]
*  DJT was on the Epstein client list. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=262.26s)]
*  I mean, something that he knows [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=264.4s)]
*  can't be immediately verified. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=265.68s)]
*  Also, if Trump was on that island [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=266.91999999999996s)]
*  doing something illegal after all [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  the legal battles that Biden [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  threw at him. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=272.84s)]
*  If he had done something illegal [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=273.8s)]
*  with Jeffrey Epstein, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=275.44s)]
*  you would think they would have [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=276.68s)]
*  thrown that at him, no? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  They pulled out the stops on [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=279.08s)]
*  everything else. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=280.2s)]
*  The only thing we can point to that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=282.0s)]
*  was a known association with [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=283.52s)]
*  Epstein was that he was at his [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=284.88s)]
*  club once. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=286.36s)]
*  And by the way, Trump kicked him [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=287.12s)]
*  out of that club because of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=288.68s)]
*  reported bad behavior. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=290.0s)]
*  And also, Elon, if you knew he was [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=292.4s)]
*  on the Epstein client list, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=294.52s)]
*  why did you let him board Marine [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  One with your son? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=298.2s)]
*  Just asking. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=299.79999999999995s)]
*  But the best thing for Trump to do [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=301.4s)]
*  now is to release the list, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=303.24s)]
*  something that also our FBI and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=304.84s)]
*  Pam Bondi have promised us. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=306.64s)]
*  Yeah, and that's a valid point, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=308.84s)]
*  especially when you consider that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=310.44s)]
*  he recently stated he would not let [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=312.32s)]
*  Bill Gates babysit his son because [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=314.4s)]
*  of Gates's ties to Epstein. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=316.4s)]
*  And content creator Lil Tay also [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=318.76000000000005s)]
*  made this very valid point. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=320.76000000000005s)]
*  She posted this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=323.16s)]
*  So you knew this, yet you still [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=324.48s)]
*  endorsed Trump, reinstated his [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=326.36s)]
*  account, amplified his content, and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  gave him a platform to spread [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=330.88000000000005s)]
*  misinformation and campaign. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  You don't get credit for [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  exposing something everyone [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=336.04s)]
*  already knew was true. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  You're just as complicit. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=339.32000000000005s)]
*  Very succinct there. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=341.44000000000005s)]
*  So while Trump has obviously fired [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  back at Elon on True Social over [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=344.72s)]
*  other claims that Elon has made and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=346.8s)]
*  his criticism of the big beautiful [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=348.92s)]
*  bill, Trump has been mum on [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=351.24s)]
*  the Epstein claim literally. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=353.08s)]
*  We're going to have a little [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=355.64s)]
*  discussion now, very private. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=357.0s)]
*  And I just want to thank you all [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=359.24s)]

*  Mr. President, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=364.04s)]
*  only response for you on this. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=364.64s)]
*  I mean, you can't back it up. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=366.2s)]
*  It's too far. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=368.56s)]

*  Okay, our audio didn't cut out [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=379.8s)]
*  there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=381.6s)]
*  The hot mics were cut at a presser [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=382.16s)]
*  last night at a roundtable [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=384.28000000000003s)]

*  So this is from MediaEight. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=391.04s)]
*  In the closing seconds of the photo [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=392.56s)]
*  op, Trump thanked the press and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=394.44s)]
*  was bombarded with shouted [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=396.32s)]
*  questions, but the official White [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=397.96s)]

*  The shouting can be heard on other [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=404.76s)]

*  on the pool feed were cut seconds [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=408.84s)]

*  continued. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=412.68s)]

*  Trump to respond, saying, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  Trump needs to respond ASAP. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=418.68s)]
*  I notice he did not take questions [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=420.6s)]
*  at his public meeting today. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=422.88s)]
*  And yes, that's very astute of you, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=425.04s)]
*  Alex Jones, but it's not just Trump [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=427.12s)]
*  keeping quiet. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=429.24s)]

*  So the White House responds to Musk [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  saying the Epstein files haven't [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=435.76000000000005s)]

*  Waldenberg, this is an unfortunate [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=442.88s)]
*  episode from Elon who was unhappy [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=445.04s)]
*  with the one big beautiful bill, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=446.92s)]
*  because it does not include [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=448.92s)]
*  the policies he wanted. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=450.68s)]
*  The President is focused on passing [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=452.36s)]
*  this historic piece of legislation [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  and making our country great again. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=456.48s)]

*  One, are you surprised that Elon is [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=461.0s)]
*  outing Trump in this way or two, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=463.76s)]
*  by the reaction to this revelation? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  Because as we said, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=469.68s)]
*  it's not anything new that Trump [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=470.88s)]
*  had said, as the guy said on Newsmax, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  there's nothing that can be [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  immediately verified with [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  anything that he said. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=478.56s)]
*  So we already knew that Trump had [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=480.16s)]
*  some kind of friendly relationship [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=481.96s)]
*  with Epstein, so what can we look [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=483.88s)]
*  forward to with this? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=485.92s)]
*  Yeah, so there's the lighter side [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=487.36s)]
*  and the more serious side. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  But on the lighter side, this is, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=490.64s)]
*  when a couple breaks up and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=493.04s)]
*  the mutual friends don't know what [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=494.88s)]
*  to do and who to side with. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=497.36s)]
*  So seeing Maga's reaction in that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=499.76s)]
*  way is kind of hilarious. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=501.96s)]
*  But Maga's reaction has a serious [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=504.04s)]
*  side, like I said, and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  I'll get to that and say, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=507.04s)]
*  is giving away Tesla, which is kind [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=508.32s)]
*  of like giving away or throwing [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  away your mixtape that your ex [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=512.76s)]
*  gave you. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=514.76s)]
*  I don't want it anymore, okay? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=517.12s)]
*  But now to the serious stuff, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=520.16s)]
*  look, this isn't just because [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=522.12s)]
*  Elon said it, Maga was already [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=523.9599999999999s)]
*  super livid about the Epstein [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=525.92s)]
*  files not being released. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=527.9599999999999s)]
*  And Anna and I have shown you on [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=530.4s)]
*  that clips about that on the show [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=532.4s)]
*  many times of Vinny from Patrick [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=534.68s)]
*  but David show and so [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=537.2s)]
*  many others going, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=538.34s)]
*  where the hell are the files? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=539.48s)]
*  We don't believe you, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=541.28s)]
*  we don't believe you. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=542.6s)]
*  And they're saying that about [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=543.8s)]
*  Trump, they're saying that about [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=545.16s)]
*  that about this administration. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=546.68s)]
*  At this point, there's a ton of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=548.32s)]
*  people who want Pam Bondi fired. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=550.0s)]
*  They're mad at Cash Patel, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=551.84s)]
*  they're mad at Dan Bongino. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=553.56s)]
*  So this is not going to go away. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=555.28s)]
*  This usually, especially in [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=559.32s)]
*  this first term, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=561.32s)]
*  Trump would just say, yeah, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=562.52s)]
*  the hurricane did go in a direction [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=564.5999999999999s)]
*  it didn't go, I magically moved it [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=567.0s)]
*  with my marquee, Sharpie marquee, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=569.52s)]
*  what the hell's a marquee? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=572.4s)]
*  Okay, with my Sharpie. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  And then all of Maga would be like, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  of course Sharpies can move [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=579.4s)]
*  hurricanes, the hurricane actually [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=581.0s)]
*  went that way. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=583.1199999999999s)]
*  Now they're like, half of them are [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=584.0s)]
*  like, yeah, Epstein files should [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=586.68s)]
*  not be released. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=589.3599999999999s)]
*  Actually, it's not half of them, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=590.92s)]
*  actually it's not half, they really [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=593.5999999999999s)]
*  can't get themselves to say that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=595.5999999999999s)]
*  So a lot of them are saying, yeah, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=597.56s)]
*  there's something super wrong here. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  And Elon Musk now has stirred up [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=601.28s)]
*  that hornest nest in a way that's [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  going to be a huge problem for [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  Trump going forward. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=606.5999999999999s)]
*  That's my assessment. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  Brett, what do you think? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=609.0s)]
*  I mean, for me, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=610.0s)]
*  there's a lot of weird framings [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=611.1999999999999s)]
*  here. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  One is, it seems like people are [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=614.0s)]
*  saying, listen, in order to tell [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=616.3599999999999s)]
*  if Donald Trump's a pervert, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=618.8399999999999s)]
*  I need to see the Epstein files. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  My counterpoint would be, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=623.64s)]
*  I feel like I know he's a pervert. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=625.28s)]
*  This would just be additional [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=627.4s)]
*  evidence that he's a pervert. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  So if all these right wing people [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=631.3199999999999s)]
*  think that Donald Trump is [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  the champion of those who are [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=635.28s)]
*  fighting against child trafficking [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=637.36s)]
*  and the deep states what's been [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=639.88s)]
*  keeping him broke, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=642.04s)]
*  he's been president twice. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  At what point is he going to throw [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=645.48s)]
*  out all the child sex traffickers? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=647.28s)]
*  What is he waiting for? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=649.48s)]
*  The Epstein files is just a more [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=651.0799999999999s)]
*  crystallization of this. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=653.12s)]
*  But this is a guy who already said [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=654.8s)]
*  he would date a 10 year old in 10 [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=656.52s)]
*  years. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=658.16s)]
*  This is a guy who allegedly walked [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=658.72s)]
*  into the Miss Teen Universe pageant [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=660.4s)]
*  dressing room. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=662.16s)]
*  This is a guy who has said he [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=663.0s)]
*  would have slept with his own [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=664.72s)]
*  daughter and their defenses, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=666.52s)]
*  he's just lying. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=668.4s)]
*  Understand this, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=669.64s)]
*  it's a bunch of weird levels. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=670.6s)]
*  The only way to know who ended up [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=672.36s)]
*  winning this in the end is we just [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=674.24s)]
*  need to see which one of them gets [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=676.2s)]
*  a haircut because it is absolutely [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=678.24s)]
*  like a normal breakup where you're [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=680.44s)]
*  like, who's in worse situation here? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=682.8s)]
*  And then one of them shows up with [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=685.3199999999999s)]
*  a completely new look and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=687.36s)]
*  you're like, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=688.88s)]
*  if Donald Trump cuts his hair then [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=689.76s)]
*  he definitely lost. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=691.92s)]
*  But yeah, and then that guy in [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=693.3199999999999s)]
*  the first clip who's like, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=695.16s)]
*  I'm not taking a side here. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=697.12s)]
*  Okay, but there's plenty to take [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=699.16s)]
*  a side on because they are in [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=701.16s)]
*  a fight. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=702.92s)]
*  And ostensibly, this stuff you can [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  take a side on is the more [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=705.92s)]
*  important stuff. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=707.76s)]
*  It has nothing to do with Epstein [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  Island and trafficking and all that. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=711.68s)]
*  It has everything to do with what [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=714.6s)]
*  they're fighting about. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=716.12s)]
*  What are you on the right for? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=717.1999999999999s)]
*  Are you for subsidies to people [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=719.0s)]
*  like Elon Musk? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=721.08s)]
*  Are you for cuts to like vital [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=721.88s)]
*  programs within the economy? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=723.92s)]

*  that? Because I think that's [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=733.76s)]
*  something that will more directly [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=735.12s)]

*  this Epstein revelation. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=744.28s)]
*  Because it's not really going to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  change how I feel about anything [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=747.88s)]

*  I know who he is. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=754.4s)]
*  We've known who he's been for [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=755.52s)]
*  years even before he was [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=757.0s)]
*  the president and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=758.24s)]
*  then they still elected him. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=759.04s)]
*  But what's interesting about this [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  whole Elon Musk thing and all these [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=762.68s)]

*  right, they really just hang on to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=766.36s)]
*  it like that is the last bastion of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=768.1999999999999s)]
*  hope that they have that he was [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=770.08s)]

*  He wasn't doing any of the Epstein [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=773.44s)]
*  stuff because they've demonized [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=775.2800000000001s)]
*  all that stuff for so long that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=777.2s)]
*  they're really not able to walk [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=778.88s)]
*  that back realistically in a way [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=780.7s)]

*  I know that a lot of times they [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=784.32s)]
*  like to lie and just pretend like [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=785.8000000000001s)]
*  they didn't say certain things [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=787.4000000000001s)]
*  before. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=788.96s)]
*  They'll say one thing, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=789.76s)]
*  say a different thing the next day [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=790.6800000000001s)]
*  and just completely forget that [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=792.0400000000001s)]
*  the other thing even happened. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=793.4000000000001s)]
*  But this is a completely different [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=795.1600000000001s)]
*  thing because it's like a core [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=797.48s)]
*  of who they are everything they've [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=799.8s)]
*  built this brand off of going back [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=801.84s)]
*  to pizza gate going back even [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=803.84s)]

*  tricky for them. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=807.4s)]
*  So they're having like a come to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=808.3199999999999s)]
*  Jesus moment it seems here and [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=810.24s)]

*  the rest of us. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=813.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=814.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats say that they [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=816.48s)]

*  them? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  Right so God they're both so [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=824.36s)]
*  unbearable, unbearable. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=826.36s)]

*  this is exactly what unites the left [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=854.52s)]
*  and the right because for us, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=856.4s)]
*  none of us were on Epstein Island. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=858.08s)]
*  And obviously something terrible [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=860.32s)]
*  happened there, right? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=862.48s)]
*  By the way, not just the molestation [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=864.04s)]
*  of the kids which is already [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=866.76s)]
*  despicable doesn't get any worse [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=868.64s)]
*  than that. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=871.12s)]
*  But obviously something else is [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=872.44s)]
*  also at play here because the [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=874.68s)]
*  government will not release it no [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=876.6s)]
*  matter what, right? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=878.96s)]
*  So that's basically the government [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=881.28s)]
*  saying, we're not going to tell [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=882.92s)]
*  you it's way worse than you think [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=884.44s)]
*  it is. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=886.24s)]

*  screw the people, we're never [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=889.6s)]
*  going to share that information [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=892.0s)]

*  someone or not just someone that's [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  way too small. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=899.84s)]

*  That's super obvious, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=908.4000000000001s)]
*  anyone denying that is a la la land. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--G26_E7-X4&t=909.6800000000001s)]
