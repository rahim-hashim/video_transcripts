# Elon Musk & Scott Bessent Have ALL OUT BRAWL. Activists’ Homes RAIDED - TYT April 24, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748)
*  Welcome to TYT, I'm your host, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=30.0s)]
*  Ana Kasparian, and we've got a lot [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=46.58s)]
*  to get to today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=49.72s)]
*  Honestly, one of the topics I'm [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=52.04s)]
*  really looking forward to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  discussing with Wozni Lombre in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=54.78s)]
*  the second hour is the aftermath of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=56.34s)]
*  that epic non-debate debate between [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=58.8s)]
*  Dave Smith and Douglas Murray on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=61.24s)]
*  Joe Rogan's podcast. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=63.3s)]
*  There are so many different [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  figures who have weighed in on it, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=66.56s)]
*  and I've resisted the urge to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=68.6s)]
*  cover it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=70.28s)]
*  But I'm going to cover it today [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=70.88s)]
*  because Jordan Peterson went on [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=72.56s)]
*  Rogan's show and tried to subtly [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=74.36s)]
*  convince him that maybe it's not a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=76.2s)]
*  good idea to have people like [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Dave Smith on your program. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=79.86s)]
*  Maybe he falls under the camp of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=81.8s)]
*  the parasitic psychopaths and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=83.8s)]
*  narcissists. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=85.7s)]
*  By the way, no one calls people [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=86.58s)]
*  parasites more often than Jordan [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  Peterson does, and it makes me a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=89.78s)]
*  little bit uncomfortable, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  to be honest. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=92.5s)]
*  But we're going to get to that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=93.22s)]
*  later in the show, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=94.5s)]
*  that's in the second hour. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=95.3s)]
*  In the first hour, we're going to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=96.5s)]
*  do some updates on the more [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=98.3s)]
*  devastating, controversial military [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  actions taken by the IDF in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  There was that story of aid workers, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=105.1s)]
*  15 aid workers who were killed in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=107.46s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=109.46s)]
*  and they were all killed in the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=110.5s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=112.46s)]
*  Aid workers, 15 aid workers who [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  were killed, we have some updates [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=115.42s)]
*  following an investigation into [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=117.14s)]
*  that particular case. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=118.86s)]
*  So I'm going to tell you about [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=120.98s)]
*  Also going to tell you about [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=121.48s)]

*  central Gaza and how many people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=123.86s)]
*  have died as a result. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=125.30000000000001s)]
*  Later in the show, we're also going [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=126.62s)]
*  to break down some other stuff [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=128.78s)]
*  that's going on that's honestly [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=130.54s)]
*  escaping my memory at the moment. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=132.58s)]
*  There you go, Elon Musk. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=135.06s)]
*  Apparently had a shouting match [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=138.54s)]
*  with the Trump administration. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=140.06s)]

*  Let's get to our first story. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=180.22s)]
*  Traveling south on the road to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=182.5s)]
*  Rafa, the unmistakable red and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=184.46s)]

*  On route, they see another [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=194.46s)]
*  ambulance that appears to have [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=195.94s)]
*  veered off the road. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=197.62s)]
*  Their vehicles and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=198.78s)]
*  high-vis units are being [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=200.1s)]
*  clearly marked with the emblem of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=201.94s)]
*  the red crescent. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=204.22s)]
*  Little did they know that they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=205.46s)]
*  themselves are about to become [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  the victims. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  We're now learning more about [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=211.3s)]
*  the horrifying attack by the IDF [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  against 15 aid workers in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=216.26s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  And we're going to talk about [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=219.06s)]
*  the impact of the attack on [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=220.74s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=222.5s)]
*  And we're going to talk about [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=223.46s)]
*  the impact of the attack on [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=225.06s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=226.66s)]
*  And we're going to talk about [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=227.5s)]
*  the impact of the attack on [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=229.06s)]
*  15 aid workers in Gaza who were [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=230.54s)]
*  killed. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=232.46s)]
*  Now in the video that we just [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=233.94s)]
*  showed you, you could see that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=235.54s)]
*  the aid workers were obviously aid [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=237.34s)]
*  workers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=239.42s)]
*  You can see the ambulance trucks [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=240.38s)]
*  with their bright flashing lights. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=242.26s)]
*  But nonetheless, through [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=244.54s)]
*  an investigation that's been [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=246.06s)]
*  reported by Haaretz, we have learned [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=247.86s)]
*  that the IDF was very much behind [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=250.22s)]
*  this attack. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=252.3s)]
*  And more importantly, they are [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=253.3s)]
*  lying about their involvement in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=255.86s)]
*  one, but any claim that this was [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=258.78s)]
*  a mistake or an accident, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  I think has been dispelled by this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  investigation. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  So let's get to the details. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=267.38s)]
*  Before we get into what this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=269.46s)]
*  investigation uncovered, which by [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=271.34s)]
*  the way includes gunshots at [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=273.97999999999996s)]
*  point blank range and a mass grave. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=276.02s)]
*  Here's an overview of what [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=279.14s)]
*  happened that night when 15 aid [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=280.74s)]
*  workers were killed in Gaza. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=282.74s)]
*  The video of apparent relentless [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=285.78s)]
*  Israeli fire continues for five [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=287.78s)]
*  minutes as the paramedic filming [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=289.7s)]
*  prays for mercy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=292.02s)]
*  For nearly two weeks, Israel has [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=303.02s)]
*  denied the apparent reality, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=304.85999999999996s)]
*  claiming they opened fire on [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=306.82s)]
*  suspicious vehicles advancing [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=308.58s)]

*  These dedicated ambulance workers [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=339.70000000000005s)]

*  Their ambulances were clearly [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=347.74s)]

*  to the families, they did not. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=351.22s)]
*  I would really appreciate if public [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=355.26s)]

*  with details of stories like the one [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=363.46s)]
*  that we're talking about right now. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=365.5s)]
*  Instead of diverting a debate into [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=367.26s)]
*  a ridiculous discussion about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=369.42s)]
*  whether or not someone is able to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=371.5s)]
*  comment on stuff like this, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=373.7s)]

*  an Israeli escort showing them the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=381.26s)]

*  We're going to get to Douglas Murray [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=385.62s)]
*  later on in the show, okay? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=387.46s)]
*  So let's hold off on that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=388.94s)]
*  But for now, a summary of the IDF's [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=389.9s)]
*  probe into the incident was [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=392.3s)]
*  published last week and they lied, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=394.18s)]
*  which shouldn't be surprising [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  because they lie all the time. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=398.5s)]
*  The IDF general staff investigation [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=400.9s)]
*  found that in three separate [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=403.02s)]
*  incidents, the force mistakenly [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  fired on ambulances and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=407.02000000000004s)]
*  a UN vehicle frequently deviating [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=408.54s)]
*  from orders. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  The public summary of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=412.94s)]
*  the investigation rejected claims [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  that the workers were bound and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=416.66s)]
*  executed and stated that the forces [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=418.66s)]
*  did not fire indiscriminately. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=421.06s)]
*  Now that last line, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=424.86s)]
*  I want you to take it in because [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=426.18s)]
*  that's the biggest lie, that the IDF [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=427.98s)]
*  did not fire indiscriminately, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=430.22s)]
*  they did. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=432.22s)]
*  So this expose was done by Israeli [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=433.46s)]
*  newspaper Haaretz, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=435.58s)]
*  as I mentioned earlier. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=436.9s)]
*  And it revealed that it was much [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  worse than what the IDF was [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  admitting to. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=441.94s)]
*  Here's what actually happened. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=443.21999999999997s)]
*  On the night of March 23rd and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=444.85999999999996s)]
*  into the 24th, the IDF was actually [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=447.02s)]
*  preparing for a surprise assault on [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=449.7s)]
*  the Tel El Sultan district of Rafa. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=452.46s)]
*  Okay, so that's on the southern end [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=456.02s)]
*  of the Rafa Strip, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=457.58s)]
*  where they suspected Hamas militants [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=458.5s)]
*  were reorganizing after the brief [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=460.58s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=462.58000000000004s)]
*  So the Sarah Sarah Sarah Rett [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=464.18s)]
*  Gholani unit of the IDF was tasked [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=466.38s)]
*  with carrying out this ambush. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=469.18s)]
*  And around 2am, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=471.86s)]
*  2 in the morning, they set up along [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=472.98s)]
*  the route expected to be used by [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=475.42s)]
*  Palestinians evacuating toward [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=477.58000000000004s)]
*  Khan Yunis and Al Mawasi, okay? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=480.02000000000004s)]
*  So the route where the Israeli [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=482.66s)]
*  force positioned itself that night [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=484.94s)]
*  was one where travel was permitted [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=487.82000000000005s)]
*  for rescue personnel and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=490.5s)]
*  civilians at the time. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=492.38s)]
*  Therefore, the aid and medical [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=494.29999999999995s)]
*  workers using it were not required [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  to request special permission, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=499.21999999999997s)]
*  contrary to the IDF's initial [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=501.73999999999995s)]
*  statement following the incident, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=504.26s)]
*  following the slaughter, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=507.14s)]
*  let's be clear. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=509.06s)]
*  That statement was later found to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=510.17999999999995s)]
*  be based on incorrect information [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=512.38s)]
*  provided by the forces in the field. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=514.9s)]
*  So then the IDF was able to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=517.78s)]
*  report it to the soldiers. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=520.3s)]
*  So then at around 3.30am, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=522.5s)]
*  another IDF unit reported over [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=524.38s)]
*  the radio that there was increased [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=526.86s)]
*  ambulance movement on the route. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=529.62s)]
*  Increased ambulance, okay? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=532.46s)]
*  So they're even identifying, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  these are aid workers, okay? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=535.5s)]
*  These are ambulance trucks or vans. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=537.34s)]
*  In other words, the soldiers knew [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=540.02s)]
*  to expect ambulances driving past [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=542.22s)]
*  them on this route that they were [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=544.58s)]
*  using to do this ambush, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=546.74s)]
*  So at 3.57am, an ambulance with [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=548.8199999999999s)]
*  flashing lights passed through [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=551.22s)]
*  the area on a routine trip. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=553.5s)]
*  The occupants could not see [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=556.06s)]
*  the hidden troops. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=557.8199999999999s)]
*  Positioned on higher ground, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=559.18s)]
*  the troops were not under threat of [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=561.18s)]
*  a ramming attack and had been [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=563.5s)]
*  ordered not to reveal themselves [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=565.5s)]
*  before the main offensive [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  on Tell Al-Sultan. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=569.3s)]
*  Nonetheless, the deputy commander [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=571.66s)]
*  instructed the entire force to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=574.3399999999999s)]
*  prepare to fire on the ambulance. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=576.74s)]
*  That was the order. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=581.22s)]
*  And as the ambulance was about to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=583.1400000000001s)]
*  pass by, the soldiers did just that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=585.0600000000001s)]
*  They start firing at the ambulance. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=587.38s)]
*  They charged toward the vehicle [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=589.34s)]
*  while shooting, killing two aid [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=591.26s)]
*  workers and detaining another [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=593.1400000000001s)]
*  person. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=594.86s)]
*  So the soldiers turned off [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=596.26s)]
*  the ambulance and its lights, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=597.74s)]
*  concealed the bodies and returned [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=599.5400000000001s)]
*  to their original position. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=601.62s)]
*  But it's not over yet, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=604.0200000000001s)]
*  there's more, it gets worse. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=605.0200000000001s)]
*  At 5.06am, a convoy of rescue [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=606.82s)]
*  workers, including ambulances and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=608.7800000000001s)]
*  fire trucks, traveled along the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=611.26s)]
*  route, all the vehicles had their [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=613.4200000000001s)]
*  lights on and flashing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=615.62s)]

*  do an ambush. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=1007.82s)]

*  The Attorney General's office [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=1932.42s)]
*  clarified immigration officers [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=1934.26s)]

*  That's who was targeted here. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=1943.54s)]

*  It was rather a multi-jurisdictional [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=1958.06s)]

*  I live in Los Angeles. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=1967.74s)]

*  no one ended up getting arrested [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=1997.94s)]
*  for any reason. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2000.1000000000001s)]

*  any Democrats with a few exceptions, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2174.94s)]
*  to be honest. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2176.9s)]
*  So the way these raids were [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2177.54s)]
*  carried out was super suspicious. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2179.02s)]
*  There was no reason noted in [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2180.78s)]

*  criminal charges that they were [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2190.18s)]
*  being investigated for. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2191.9s)]
*  That was a statement from [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2193.66s)]
*  the lawyer. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2194.86s)]
*  In addition to that, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2195.54s)]
*  Tahrir Coalition told Dropsite News [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2196.8s)]
*  that officers refused to present [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2199.26s)]
*  warrants at one of the sites that [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2201.38s)]
*  they raided. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2203.3s)]
*  They, meaning law enforcement, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2206.18s)]
*  were looking for red and black [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2207.9s)]
*  paint, they were looking for [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2209.42s)]
*  electronic devices, and they were [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2210.94s)]
*  looking for any kind of [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2212.78s)]
*  communication materials that any [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2214.02s)]
*  kind of individuals had. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2215.9s)]
*  The lawyer also says that several [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2217.34s)]
*  people were detained briefly, but [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2219.26s)]
*  no arrests were made. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2221.1800000000003s)]
*  So that's what's currently [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2222.54s)]
*  happening to American citizens. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2224.3s)]
*  Just suspicious, weird warrants, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2226.54s)]
*  vague warrants, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2230.2200000000003s)]
*  flimsy allegations of vandalism. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2232.1800000000003s)]
*  Again, for the FBI to join state [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2236.6600000000003s)]
*  authorities, local authorities to [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2238.86s)]
*  break down your door, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2241.42s)]
*  there better be a serious crime [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2242.9s)]
*  committed. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2245.06s)]
*  But even if it were true that [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2246.2999999999997s)]
*  these students engaged in vandalism, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2248.5s)]
*  a raid like that, really? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2251.58s)]
*  Vandalism justifies a raid like [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2255.8599999999997s)]
*  that, and I'm not buying that it [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2257.5s)]
*  was vandalism, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2259.22s)]
*  I need to see some evidence. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2260.14s)]
*  There could have been, but if there [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2262.02s)]
*  was, wouldn't some of these [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2263.9399999999996s)]
*  students actually be arrested for [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2265.5s)]
*  said vandalism? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2267.4199999999996s)]
*  I think this was meant to send [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2268.5s)]
*  a message. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2270.3399999999997s)]
*  So she also says that several [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2272.74s)]
*  people were detained, not arrested. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2274.2599999999998s)]
*  And look, that's happening to [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2275.7799999999997s)]
*  American citizens. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2277.5s)]
*  But I want you to remember that [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2278.54s)]
*  this has been going on, maybe not [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2280.66s)]
*  in regard to American citizens, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2282.98s)]
*  but it's certainly something that [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2285.14s)]
*  student visa holders have been [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2287.3799999999997s)]

*  We can't forget about Rumiessa [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2293.58s)]
*  Osturk, who was a doctoral student [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2295.8999999999996s)]
*  at Tufts University. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2298.66s)]
*  And she was arrested in broad [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2300.62s)]
*  daylight, for what reason? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2302.58s)]
*  She co-wrote an op-ed for [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2305.7s)]
*  the student newspaper that was [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2307.42s)]
*  critical of how Israel is carrying [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2309.66s)]
*  out this war in Gaza. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2312.02s)]
*  And a lot of people made [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2313.5s)]
*  justifications for that. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2315.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, if we're going to set [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2317.06s)]
*  this tone, better be real careful. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2319.46s)]
*  Honestly, it's incredible to me [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2325.62s)]
*  that people are okay with this. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2327.38s)]
*  Now, let's see what Trump loyalist [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2330.18s)]
*  Kirk has to say about what happened [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2332.18s)]
*  to Osturk. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2334.2599999999998s)]
*  He's getting some props for this. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2335.98s)]
*  Let's see if he deserves it. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2337.46s)]
*  Deporting somebody because they [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2340.06s)]
*  wrote an op-ed critical of Israel. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2341.58s)]
*  I think that's probably in [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2344.06s)]
*  the gray area. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2345.54s)]

*  excited about what Cenk is doing, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2693.42s)]
*  but they felt that I was being [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2694.9s)]
*  dismissive about it and [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2696.06s)]
*  they couldn't understand why. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2696.9s)]
*  No, no, it wasn't that I was being [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2698.1s)]
*  dismissive about it. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2699.42s)]
*  It was that I knew what was coming [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2700.54s)]
*  and I'm just so [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2702.7799999999997s)]
*  sick of dealing with it. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2703.86s)]
*  Because I have nothing to do with [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2706.46s)]
*  it, but I get all the blowback. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2708.34s)]
*  So that's the reality of [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2711.18s)]
*  the situation, okay? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2712.26s)]
*  It's unfair, but it is what it is. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2714.22s)]
*  And I've got so [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2716.7s)]
*  many other massive problems in my [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2718.02s)]
*  life, adding this to the pile is [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2720.7s)]
*  frustrating. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2723.26s)]
*  History Speaks also says, Ana, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2724.9s)]
*  given the date, I thought you [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2726.38s)]
*  might find it interesting that [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2727.7400000000002s)]
*  a new generation Turkish [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2729.3s)]
*  historians are increasingly [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2730.62s)]
*  recognizing the reality of [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2732.06s)]
*  the Armenian genocide and [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2733.38s)]
*  contributing to historical [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2734.58s)]
*  research on it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2735.78s)]
*  Listen, despite what the Turkish [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2737.22s)]
*  government did to the Armenian [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2739.9799999999996s)]
*  people over a century ago, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2742.54s)]
*  I'm able to differentiate Turkish [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2744.66s)]
*  people from those who committed [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2747.3799999999997s)]
*  the atrocities. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2750.06s)]
*  And so there are wonderful Turkish [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2751.62s)]
*  people out there, I consider them [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2753.66s)]
*  my brothers and sisters. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2755.74s)]
*  And yes, a lot of them do [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2757.4199999999996s)]
*  acknowledge the Armenian genocide. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2758.9399999999996s)]
*  And I'm happy that the tide has [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2761.74s)]
*  kind of begun to turn on the [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2764.14s)]
*  historical revisionism that [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2766.2999999999997s)]
*  Armenians have had to stomach for [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2768.46s)]
*  so long. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2770.94s)]
*  Genocide happened, and [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2772.7799999999997s)]
*  the acknowledgement really does [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2774.2999999999997s)]
*  matter. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2776.14s)]
*  All right, let's get to one more [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2776.66s)]
*  story before we bring Waz in. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2778.58s)]
*  One other person I want to ask you [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2780.2999999999997s)]
*  about is Scott Besant, who you, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2782.34s)]
*  who I first, as a sometime war, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2784.46s)]
*  Steve Bannon's war room listener, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2786.5s)]
*  that's where I first discovered [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2788.74s)]
*  Besant. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2790.66s)]
*  I wonder, he reportedly just today [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2791.34s)]
*  reportedly had a huge, maybe [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2793.62s)]
*  physical blowout with Elon Musk in [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2795.6600000000003s)]
*  the West Wing. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2797.5800000000004s)]
*  What should people know about him? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2799.86s)]
*  First off, he's a safe pair of [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2801.78s)]
*  hands. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2802.98s)]
*  If Howard Lutnick had been [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2803.5s)]
*  Secretary of the Treasury, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2804.6200000000003s)]
*  it would have been an unmitigated [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2805.98s)]
*  disaster, okay? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2807.6600000000003s)]
*  Unmitigated disaster, and [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2808.86s)]
*  this is about people putting their [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2810.38s)]
*  own interests first, like Elon, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2812.1800000000003s)]
*  versus putting the nation's [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2813.98s)]
*  interests first. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2815.46s)]
*  Elon Musk is leaving the Trump [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2818.9s)]
*  White House, and it looks like his [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2821.0600000000004s)]
*  inability to get along with folks [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2823.7799999999997s)]
*  within the administration is maybe [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2826.1s)]
*  one of the factors behind his [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2828.7799999999997s)]
*  decision to move on and [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2830.98s)]
*  focus on Tesla. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2832.98s)]
*  So in fact, Axios is reporting that [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2835.2999999999997s)]
*  Elon Musk and the Treasury [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2837.74s)]
*  Secretary, Scott Besant, got into [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2839.74s)]
*  a pretty fiery shouting match. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2842.22s)]
*  Now, what was this all about? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2844.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, the bad blood allegedly [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2845.8199999999997s)]
*  kicked off during Trump's transition [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2847.8599999999997s)]
*  to the White House. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2850.2999999999997s)]
*  Now, during this time, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2851.74s)]
*  he's tapping various individuals to [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2853.2999999999997s)]
*  serve in his cabinet, and Musk was [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2855.58s)]
*  lobbying pretty hard for [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2857.98s)]
*  Howard Lutnick to be Treasury [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2859.7799999999997s)]
*  Secretary. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2862.06s)]
*  But Trump ultimately went with [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2863.7799999999997s)]
*  Besant and tapped Lutnick to be [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2866.02s)]
*  the Commerce Secretary. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2868.58s)]
*  Then the clashes over staffing [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2871.42s)]
*  really started to heat up. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2873.54s)]
*  So according to an ally to Scott [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2875.2599999999998s)]
*  Besant, Scott can't stand Musk. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2878.06s)]
*  That goes pretty deep and [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2881.7400000000002s)]
*  pretty far back, but [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2883.58s)]
*  he's acting like a grown up about [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2884.94s)]
*  it. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2887.06s)]
*  And look, he does seem pretty even [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2887.56s)]
*  keeled most times. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2889.7400000000002s)]
*  I haven't really seen him fired up [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2890.86s)]
*  or irrationally angry or [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2893.18s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2894.94s)]
*  He doesn't really engage publicly [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2896.42s)]
*  the way that Elon Musk does, but [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2898.82s)]
*  everyone has their tipping points. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2901.1s)]
*  So last week, Trump appointed [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2903.66s)]
*  longtime IRS agent Gary Shapley as [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2905.98s)]
*  the interim head of the IRS. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2909.1s)]
*  Now, he made that decision after [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2911.3s)]
*  Melanie Cross decided to resign [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2913.58s)]
*  from the IRS. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2915.74s)]
*  This followed the gutting of [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2916.7799999999997s)]
*  the IRS under the Trump [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2918.38s)]
*  administration. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2919.7s)]
*  However, Shapley or Shapley was [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2920.86s)]
*  appointed because Elon Musk [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2923.18s)]
*  specifically wanted him in that [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2925.14s)]
*  role. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2927.3s)]
*  But here's the problem, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2927.8s)]
*  the person who's supposed to make [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2929.2599999999998s)]
*  that decision, ultimately, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2931.1s)]
*  of course, it's Donald Trump. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2932.7s)]
*  But the recommendation is that he [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2934.5s)]
*  is supposed to come from [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2936.62s)]
*  the Treasury Secretary, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2937.98s)]
*  not from Elon Musk. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2939.62s)]
*  And so Musk's Department of [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2940.98s)]
*  Government Efficiency pushed this [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2942.98s)]
*  appointment through the White House [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2945.42s)]
*  channels and Scott Bessette was not [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2948.22s)]
*  happy about it, he was furious. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2950.94s)]
*  So Bessette had complained to [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2953.2599999999998s)]
*  Trump this week that Musk had done [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2955.02s)]
*  an end run around him to get [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2957.18s)]
*  Shapley installed as the interim [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2958.86s)]
*  head of the IRS, even though the [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2961.02s)]
*  tax policy was not going to [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2963.02s)]
*  be the interim head of the IRS, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2964.58s)]
*  even though the tax collection [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2966.58s)]
*  agency reports to Bessette, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2968.66s)]
*  the people familiar with [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2970.58s)]
*  the situation said. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2972.1s)]
*  So after getting Trump's approval, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2973.5s)]
*  Bessette was able to reverse [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2975.98s)]
*  the decision to hire Shapley. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2977.82s)]
*  So in the end, Musk didn't end up [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2980.38s)]
*  getting what he wanted because of [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2982.06s)]
*  the fact that the Treasury [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2983.7799999999997s)]
*  Secretary made such a big deal [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2985.22s)]
*  about this. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2986.98s)]
*  He wanted his deputy, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2987.7799999999997s)]
*  guy named Michael Falkender, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2989.34s)]
*  to be the acting leader of the IRS. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2991.42s)]
*  But then things devolved even [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2994.14s)]
*  further if you can believe it. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2995.42s)]
*  So during a meeting last Thursday, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2996.62s)]
*  Bessette confronted Musk head on [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=2998.8599999999997s)]
*  and apparently the F bombs [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3000.98s)]
*  started to drop. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3002.7s)]
*  So Bessette criticized Musk for [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3003.94s)]
*  over promising and [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3006.22s)]
*  under delivering budget cuts with [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3007.7s)]
*  Doge, Musk clapped back. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3010.18s)]
*  Are we ever going to retire that? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3012.22s)]
*  Is the clapped back thing just here [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3015.2999999999997s)]
*  to stay? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3017.06s)]
*  I mean, I feel like there's always [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3018.14s)]
*  trends but they're around for a [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3019.8199999999997s)]
*  year, maybe half a year. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3021.3799999999997s)]
*  Clap back is just, it's like [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3022.94s)]
*  herpes, it's here to stay, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3024.42s)]
*  it's never going to go away, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3025.7400000000002s)]
*  you'll never be cured of it. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3027.1s)]
*  Clap back by calling Bessette [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3028.7000000000003s)]
*  a Soros agent and accusing him of [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3030.98s)]
*  having run a failed hedge fund. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3033.82s)]
*  Two sources who overheard [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3036.58s)]
*  the argument recalled that at one [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3038.34s)]
*  point Bessette yelled, F you and [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3040.86s)]
*  Musk replied, say it louder. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3043.7400000000002s)]
*  And I mean, look, it just really [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3046.2200000000003s)]
*  did devolve to pretty impressive [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3049.1s)]
*  levels. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3052.06s)]
*  It was two billionaire middle-aged [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3052.7s)]
*  men thinking it was WWE in the [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3055.66s)]
*  half, in the hall of the West Wing. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3057.98s)]
*  And according to other witnesses, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3060.54s)]
*  both of which spoke to Axios, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3063.3s)]
*  they were not physical in the oval [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3065.82s)]
*  but the president saw it and [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3068.62s)]
*  then they carried it down the hall. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3070.78s)]
*  And that's when they did it again, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3073.74s)]
*  a second witness told Axios, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3075.78s)]
*  it was quite a scene, it was loud [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3077.5s)]
*  and I mean loud. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3079.5s)]
*  So these two hate each other, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3080.54s)]
*  clearly. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3081.94s)]
*  Not only did this happen within [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3083.1s)]
*  earshot of the president, but [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3084.86s)]
*  the Italian Prime Minister was also [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3086.66s)]
*  there, so we have another world [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3088.78s)]
*  leader who was able to absorb what [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3090.62s)]
*  was going on with Elon Musk and [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3092.46s)]
*  the Treasury Secretary engaging in [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3094.14s)]
*  the shouting match. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3096.1s)]
*  Now, Caroline Levitt, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3097.14s)]
*  the White House press secretary [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3098.18s)]
*  downplayed the entire situation, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3099.7400000000002s)]
*  which look, to be fair, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3101.62s)]
*  that's her job. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3102.98s)]
*  Her job is to lie to everybody on [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3103.98s)]
*  behalf of the Trump administration [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3105.86s)]
*  to make the Trump administration [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3107.9s)]
*  look good. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3109.98s)]
*  What happens with the press [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3110.62s)]
*  secretary representing a Democratic [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3112.14s)]

*  they lie, that's what they do. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3116.02s)]
*  Boys will be boys and I get it, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3118.42s)]
*  that turned into a whole news cycle. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3120.1s)]
*  But of course she's going to say [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3122.66s)]
*  that, I love how people listen to [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3124.02s)]
*  everything Caroline Levitt is [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3125.62s)]
*  saying thinking she might tell [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3127.2599999999998s)]
*  the truth, no, it's not her job to [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3128.9s)]
*  tell the truth, it's literally not [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3130.9s)]
*  her job to tell the truth. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3132.9s)]
*  But anyway, she says disagreements [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3134.5s)]
*  are a normal part of any healthy [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3136.42s)]

*  everyone knows they serve at [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3139.7s)]

*  So that wasn't even really saying [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3143.8199999999997s)]
*  anything. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3146.4199999999996s)]

*  Elon has been in the government. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH7KxEx8748&t=3148.9399999999996s)]
