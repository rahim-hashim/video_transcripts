"The Trump administration released documents Wednesday that revealed new details in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador a month ago in what a government lawyer called an ‚Äúadministrative error.‚Äù 

The documents were released after weeks of pressure on the government to prove its contention that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. The Trump administration sent him to a notorious megaprison in the Central American country as part of its promised deportation program of alleged criminals. "

# DOJ TRIES To Bolster Public Case Of Mistakenly Deported Man
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8)
*  He gets deported, he's here illegally with the United States Senator and a bunch of knuckleheads [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=0.0s)]
*  in the house that now say their main priority is bringing back someone. Maybe he's not a terrorist, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=4.72s)]
*  but he's a potential terrorist. He's a terrorist watch list person. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot more to this guy than meets the eye. I stand with the White House. I think he's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=14.96s)]
*  MS-13 and I think that they got the goods on him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=21.04s)]
*  But do they have the goods on him? That's the question. Well, last night after weeks [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=23.92s)]
*  of refusing to reveal whatever evidence they had against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  the Department of Justice released some more documents to justify his wrongful deportation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=35.92s)]
*  So before we show you their alleged receipts, Cenk, should we expect you to just totally change [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=41.36s)]
*  your mind on the concept of due process if they do have compelling evidence? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, no, there's two different issues here. One is, is this guy a criminal and an MS-13 [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=51.04s)]
*  gang member as Trump administration claims or not? I think there's pretty definitive [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=57.68s)]
*  evidence on that. So we'll get to that in a second. But most importantly, what Yaz is saying, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=62.88s)]
*  which is, are we gonna have due process or aren't we? That's by far the most important issue here, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=67.68s)]
*  because that's what affects all Americans and our system of government. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=73.68s)]
*  So let's tackle both right now. Absolutely. So the Justice Department shared records detailing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=77.28s)]
*  how police officers in Maryland determined that Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13 during an [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=83.04s)]
*  arrest in 2019, allegations he and his lawyer deny. He had no criminal history at the time, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=89.2s)]
*  which the Justice Department also admits in their documents. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=95.76s)]
*  So here it is, in a document titled Gang Field Interview Sheet, the Prince George's County Police [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=99.28s)]
*  Department detailed how in March 2019, it approached Abrego Garcia along with three [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=105.28s)]
*  other people for loitering at a Home Depot parking lot in Hyattsville. Abrego Garcia said in a court [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=111.6s)]
*  filing that he was there looking for day labor work. Police said he was wearing a Chicago Bulls [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=117.84s)]
*  hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents on the bills. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=123.68s)]
*  And the officers said such insignia indicating see no evil, hear no evil and say no evil, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=130.24s)]
*  was indicative of Hispanic gang culture. The officers said they consulted with a reliable [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=136.16s)]
*  confidential source who advised that Abrego Garcia is the rank of Kich, oh man, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=143.36s)]
*  Chiquillo with the moniker of Chele and the gang. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  Didn't the Ratliff kids just depict the see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil on the boat [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=154.4s)]
*  going to the White Lotus? I didn't know that they were supposed to be Hispanic gang members, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=159.2s)]
*  but you learn something new every day. Of course, that's ridiculous. It's super common industry. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=163.2s)]
*  It's been all over since forever. But police assessed that two other people who were with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Abrego Garcia in the Home Depot parking lot were also gang members. So here's more. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=173.44s)]
*  A court agreed to deny Abrego Garcia bond after his arrest. He wrote that the allegation that he [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  is a gang member appears to be trustworthy and is supported by other evidence in the record [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=186.16s)]
*  in the Prince George's County police documents. So Garcia was handed over to immigration [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=191.28s)]
*  authorities. But later in 2019, as we have discussed on this show many times, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=196.4s)]
*  an immigration judge barred him from being sent back to El Salvador after he proved he had a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  well-founded fear of future persecution from local gangs. Then last month, immigration agents [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=207.04s)]
*  stopped Abrego Garcia in an Ikea parking lot and deported him to El Salvador days later. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=213.12s)]
*  So far, not much new information has been revealed, but they shared some other history as well. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=220.56s)]
*  Here's this, another document released Wednesday from the Department of Homeland Security in 2019 [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  said police identified two men, one of whom was Abrego Garcia as having been previously detained [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=232.8s)]
*  in a murder investigation. Abrego Garcia denied being connected to a murder investigation, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=239.44s)]
*  the document said, and he was never charged. So aside from the new documents, DHS also posted on [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=244.64s)]
*  social media that Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez-Sura, had sought a temporary protective [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=251.6s)]
*  order against him in 2021. The petition for a protective order described a disagreement [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  and physical altercation that included hitting and scratching, but the case was ultimately [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=264.4s)]
*  dismissed. Today, Vasquez-Sura responded to that incident being publicized saying, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=269.76s)]
*  after surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=275.52s)]
*  disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=280.64s)]
*  Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  No one is perfect and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ISIS action [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  deportation. But despite the fact that his wife has been aggressively fighting for his return [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  from El Salvador, Sean Hannity and Attorney General Pam Bondi had the audacity to say this [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=308.56s)]
*  on Fox News just last night. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm having a hard time understanding why his wife is advocating for him to come back. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=317.04s)]
*  Well, America is safer because he is gone. Maryland is safer because he is gone. And that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  woman that he is married to and that child he had with her, they are safer tonight because he is [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=330.56s)]
*  out of our country and sitting in El Salvador where he belongs. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=338.16s)]
*  Cenk, the thing is none of this matters. This conversation does not matter. None of this was [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=343.52s)]
*  ever supposed to be litigated this way in the media. And it doesn't matter what the Republicans [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=347.92s)]
*  come up with to justify their actions. Nothing justifies deporting a person without due process, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=352.64s)]
*  whether he was illegal, whether he was a gang member. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  Like all of that was supposed to be decided in the courts before any kind of action was [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=362.4s)]
*  taken against him, let alone any kind of deportation. And I think that's the biggest [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=367.36s)]
*  deportation to El Salvador. Nothing any of them says matters, like no evidence they released to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=372.8s)]
*  the media matters. They should have taken all that evidence to the court, but they didn't do that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=378.56s)]
*  So right now, I feel like they're just trying to pacify the American people with this or trying to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=383.2s)]
*  politicize this moment because they don't really have a choice, I guess. They wanna maintain [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=387.6s)]
*  whatever support Trump still has left and they know that their base loves to see deportations. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=392.32s)]
*  So they're doubling down on this one, making a whole story out of it, focusing on the deportation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=397.44s)]
*  itself, demonizing a man who hasn't done anything wrong. And they're constantly reminding their [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=402.56s)]
*  supporters that we all live under this constant threat of gang violence and terrorism to the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=407.52s)]
*  point that the fear of that looming threat of gang violence and terrorism overtakes their [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=413.12s)]
*  conviction that due process is the law of this land and that needs to be protected. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=419.12s)]
*  This is also stupid. The principle does not change with the circumstance and the people [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=424.4s)]
*  who keep justifying these actions, specifically the Pam Bondis and the Sean Hannity, they know that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=428.72s)]
*  Yeah, so I think that, of course, they do have a choice. I think that they're [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=434.08000000000004s)]
*  keep going in the wrong direction here, the Trump administration, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=440.8s)]
*  on purpose. They think that this helps them politically. We'll get to that in a second. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=443.76000000000005s)]
*  So first of all, look, if you're on the right and you've heard that, well, a judge thought that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=448.24s)]
*  maybe he might be MS-13 and there was an informant who said he was MS-13 and he wore a Chicago Bulls [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=454.56s)]
*  hat. And by the way, a court did, as we explained in 2019, early in 2019, held him without bond [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=462.08s)]
*  because they weren't sure, right? So that gives you plenty of stuff to say, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=471.04s)]
*  aha, that's it. And the potential domestic violence, now he was never convicted of anything, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  etc. But you think, okay, good, bad guy, I'm good enough. Okay, now, so let me explain why I don't [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=480.96s)]
*  think that is good enough. Number one, not convicted of a single thing. If you're not [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=486.4s)]
*  convicted of anything, well, then they could just make up charges about you and say, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=490.4s)]
*  hey, you know what, they could dig into your life. You did this wrong, you did that wrong at some [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=494.56s)]
*  point. So it doesn't matter. We're not having a real trial for you. We're just getting rid of you, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  okay? So number two, this is really important, guys. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  So Yaz, I read to you guys what happened later in 2019, where another judge looked at it more [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=505.76s)]
*  definitively. And after looking at all the evidence, he said, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  Not only is he not in a gang, there's credible threats against his life by gangs in El Salvador [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=517.04s)]
*  because he's not in a gang. And they explained that if he was granted, that he was granted a [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=525.6s)]
*  withholding of removal from the country and allowed him to stay in the United States temporarily [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=534.8s)]
*  and receive a work permit, okay? So that's the judge saying, you cannot send him out of the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  country, and that is the last ruling, okay? So when Trump administration sends him out, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=546.56s)]
*  they're defying a court order already. Someone already looked at it and said, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=553.68s)]
*  do not send him back. He's not a gang member, and the gangs actually might hurt him or kill him. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=559.2s)]
*  So now if you say, no, I know better because I saw it on Fox News and I trust the Trump people [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=565.6s)]
*  and I think they're angels and I don't care because he's undocumented, etc. But you're not [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=572.88s)]
*  just saying that you don't care about this guy. You're saying I don't care about our [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=579.52s)]
*  constitutional system of government. I don't care that a judge ordered him to stay in the country. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=584.72s)]
*  Then the Supreme Court ruled unanimously, which was shocking, that the Trump administration has [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=590.1600000000001s)]
*  to facilitate his return. And then a lower court said he's definitively not an MS-13 [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=595.6s)]
*  and he must be returned. He hasn't been convicted of anything. And the Trump administration admitted [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=601.36s)]
*  in court that it was an administrative error that sent him to El Salvador, not because any judge [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=607.44s)]
*  ordered it or that they had even accurately assessed that he should be sent to El Salvador. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=613.84s)]
*  So if you want to rest your laurels on, I don't care about anything. And by the way, at some point [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=618.4s)]
*  he was undocumented. And yeah, the judge said we should keep him here, but I don't care about the [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=626.24s)]
*  judge. I don't agree with any of that. Okay, but what you're doing is you're burning down the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=631.6s)]
*  judicial system that we have. And we can't do that. That is by far the most important part [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=636.0s)]
*  of this story. Because if we start saying that allowing the executive branch to say, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=641.04s)]
*  I don't care what the courts ruled, I'm gonna do whatever I want, that's not a democracy. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=647.12s)]
*  That's not a constitutional form of government. That's an authoritarian government. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=651.68s)]
*  And if he has a right to send this guy after the courts tell him not to and to bring him back, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=655.8399999999999s)]
*  then he could send you or anyone else. Well, wait, wait, I'm a US citizen. He can't do that. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=661.04s)]
*  Is that right? Because Trump has been saying for the last week that he wants to do it [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=666.0s)]
*  for American citizens, the homegrowns. And then he wants to send you to El Salvador. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=670.96s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying you in particular, but you and if you say, well, he's talking about killers [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=675.2800000000001s)]
*  and rapists and all these things. But he's talking about doing it without due process. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=680.24s)]
*  So how do you know if they're bad guys? No, this is not a form of government. This is not America. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=684.88s)]
*  So this is less about immigration. And even in that case on the immigration issue, it's [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=691.9200000000001s)]
*  unbelievable that they sent the wrong guy. They know they sent the wrong guy. They admitted it was [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=698.32s)]
*  an administrative error and they won't fix it. And the reason for that, as we explained, is politics. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=703.52s)]
*  They think that they can mislead people enough to get folks to believe that Democrats are just [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=708.24s)]
*  protecting gang members. And if they feel like that if they lie enough, like JD Vance says, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=714.64s)]
*  he is MS-13. And they say all these terrible things about him. They could trick people into [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=720.24s)]
*  thinking that he is in that gang and the Democrats are protecting criminals, right? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=725.44s)]
*  That's the political play here. But in the meanwhile, A, they're wrong about that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=729.36s)]
*  completely. And B, much more importantly, if we allow this to stand, then they could really do [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=734.0s)]
*  anything they want to anybody, including US citizens. Because then we don't have due process [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=740.72s)]
*  anymore. They don't have to present you to a court. They just make unilateral decisions [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  and there'll be nothing you could do about it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you said that the judicial aspect was the most important aspect of this story. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=752.96s)]
*  I would argue it's the only aspect of this story that matters. Everything else is superfluous and [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=757.84s)]
*  it's just them trying to save their own what. But you are right. They're completely, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=762.64s)]
*  they're making it political. Let's see how that's going. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg-ZiIGRkf8&t=768.32s)]
