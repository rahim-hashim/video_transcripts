The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Insider EXPOSES How Democrats Secretly Recruit Donors
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8)
*  I believe you could be a Trojan horse. I believe that someone who spent the better part of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=0.0s)]
*  the last election supporting Biden and Kamala Harris all of a sudden sees the light after [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=4.36s)]
*  Donald Trump wins an election. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=9.48s)]
*  I mean, you're not that much different from Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=10.92s)]
*  Well, I know that I have a lot to prove, but give me a chance to prove that. Don't shut [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=14.88s)]
*  the door. I'm a law officer and you're not gonna find a harder worker. I'm already working [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  hard to make sure that we nail the midterms because this is absolutely pivotal. We can't [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=22.92s)]
*  go back to the trans insanity. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=27.52s)]
*  I am done with that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=29.76s)]
*  Well, the woman that you just heard, conservative Eric Boling, accused of being a Trojan horse [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  for MAGA is a former fundraiser for the Democratic Party. Her name is Lindy Lee. If you're politically [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=38.04s)]
*  engaged, you've probably seen her interviews on cable news and lots of other different [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=45.2s)]
*  shows. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  And after helping Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris raise millions of dollars for their [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=50.52s)]
*  campaigns, including Biden's reelection campaign, Lee went on to defect from the Democratic [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=56.56s)]
*  Party and support Donald Trump. Lindy Lee, it's a pleasure to have you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=62.2s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me, you guys. I've been watching you since I was out of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=69.08s)]
*  college, so this is very surreal for me. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=73.04s)]
*  That's awesome. All right, well, I wanted to kind of start off by kind of understanding [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=75.48s)]
*  you kind of got to the place you're at right now. So let me start by kind of giving a little [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  bit of the explanation you provided on Piers Morgan's show and then I'll clarify what I'm [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=87.0s)]
*  asking you specifically. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=92.24s)]
*  Let's take a look at why you soured on a portion of the Democratic Party back in 2016. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=93.48s)]
*  Ideologically, it's a massive, massive move to go from somebody who supports Joe Biden [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=101.12s)]
*  and Kamala Harris to somebody who supports Donald Trump. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=107.88s)]
*  I've always been on the conservative wing of the party and there's a paper trail. Five [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  years ago, I went to war with the Bernie Bros. That's how I emerged on the public scene. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=115.52s)]
*  That's how everyone, that's how I got my start. I, as a conservative, refused to vote for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=120.08s)]
*  Bernie Sanders because he went against everything I believed in. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=124.44s)]
*  Okay, so you were against the Bernie wing of the Democratic Party, which I identify [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=127.88s)]
*  as like the economic populist wing of the Democratic Party. Wing is a little generous. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=135.48s)]
*  I would say there's like maybe two people in the Democratic Party who identify that way. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  But you also soured on the economically or fiscally conservative but socially far left [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=144.28s)]
*  wing of the Democratic Party. Let's take a look at that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=150.68s)]
*  When I first became a Democrat, it was actually pre-Obama. We believed in middle class values, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=152.92s)]
*  fiscal responsibility, like moderation. We didn't think that biological men should be [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=160.52s)]
*  in women's sports. That's a fairly recent development, I think. In the past five years, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=165.96s)]
*  I'm not in favor of that. I think that's absolutely just lunacy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=170.36s)]
*  These are recent developments. The woke and the trans insanity, the DEI stuff, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=173.8s)]
*  I didn't sign up for that. I just didn't and I was terrified of vocalizing my opposition. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=178.52s)]
*  So who did you like in the Democratic Party? Because those are the two separate wings. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=183.32s)]
*  And I'm curious if you might have just always identified as conservative, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=190.76s)]
*  but wasn't really fully self aware. What do you think? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=195.4s)]
*  First of all, thank you so much for asking questions with respect. Over the last couple [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=198.44s)]
*  weeks, I've been kind of on edge of my seat waiting to be attacked because of my views. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=203.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for being gracious about it. As the years went on, I don't think I really like [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=208.12s)]
*  anyone. I most closely identify with my friend, Governor Josh Shapiro. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=214.28s)]
*  But even he is to my left on several issues. It's weird because you and I have gone through [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  similar experiences. On the Sean Ryan show, I talked about how I was assaulted just by standing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=225.96s)]
*  outside. I mean, that's something that you've been through as well. And it didn't just happen [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=231.4s)]
*  once. It happened several times in a progressive run city. We have an extremely left leaning [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=237.08s)]
*  DA who's funded by George Soros and he doesn't prosecute minor crimes and it results in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=244.68s)]
*  unlivable streets. And this is the state of American cities today. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=250.12s)]
*  I mean, it's just one of the many reasons why I decided to leave. It's been extremely hard. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=254.68s)]
*  This is not easy. If I wanted an easy life, if I wanted peace, I wouldn't have done any of this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  But it was necessary. I no longer fit into this party, into this cult. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=265.24s)]
*  Yeah, Lindy, I'm curious. As a conservative Democrat, why were you so animated by the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=268.52s)]
*  Democrats in the first place? Why go through the significant effort of raising money for them? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=275.24s)]
*  This is just my entire life. I grew up in the age of Obama. He was elected in 2008. I was 17 years [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=284.68s)]
*  old. And I remember being just so ecstatic, so rejoiced that this would be the era of hope [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=291.72s)]
*  and change. And obviously, we were quickly disillusioned, but it was my most formative era. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=298.36s)]
*  It was my default position. I grew up in suburban Pennsylvania where the default was moderation, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=302.6s)]
*  social conservative Democrats. That's essentially what the Collard counties of Pennsylvania are [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=309.24s)]
*  known for. It's a swing area. And I didn't really have a reason to question my entire belief system [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=314.12s)]
*  until the last couple years. And this took me a long time to come here. But over the last couple [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=321.08s)]
*  years, what didn't just happen suddenly, as people say, this has been a very gradual process. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's also been deeply personal to me. And one thing that I've never said before is something [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=330.35999999999996s)]
*  that happened to me over the course of this past decade. I was put on birth control in 2018 [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=336.52s)]
*  because of health issues. And it completely upended my life. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=344.76s)]
*  How so? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  I really never said this before, but it's really had such a traumatic and tremendous impact on my [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  thinking. I feel like I wasted five years of my life because I was on birth control. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  And when I decided to come off it in May 2023, I felt like I reclaimed my life and realized that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  conservatives were right about birth control. It completely hijacks your hormones. It makes you [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=366.68s)]
*  extremely anxious. And I would just expect it to just take it without question. I tried to express [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=373.32s)]
*  my concerns to my doctor, but she was living in this liberal ideology where you could just [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  medicate yourself to recovery. But now that I've been off it for two years, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  I feel like I'm a new woman. I finally have full control over my mind. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=389.16s)]
*  And I'm finally free to be who I am without being shackled. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=392.6s)]
*  So, Lindy, I'm sympathetic to what you're saying. Look, my body does not respond well to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=396.36s)]
*  hormonal birth control. But that had nothing to do with my political identity, right? And where I [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=407.8s)]
*  stand on specific political issues. Now, I feel alienated from the Democratic Party because, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  first of all, I don't even know what the Democratic Party at this moment represents. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  They sometimes run on these big, bold policies, never deliver. And for me, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  I am very much economically left wing. I agree with you on some of the extremities of what's [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=431.64s)]
*  happened to the Democratic Party in recent years. But I actually view that as a symptom [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=437.56s)]
*  of the corporate cash flowing into these campaign coffers. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=442.84s)]
*  And then you have this party that essentially is similar to the Republicans in wanting to pursue [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=446.35999999999996s)]
*  policies that are way more beneficial to corporate interests and the elite in this country. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=451.56s)]
*  And so what do they campaign on and what do they actually do when they're in power? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=457.0s)]
*  They lean heavily into some of these social issues and they get more and more extreme [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=460.44s)]
*  every election cycle. And in the end, they went too far and people kind of turn their backs on the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=466.36s)]
*  party. That's how I kind of view the situation. So when I look at the political landscape, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=471.48s)]
*  I personally feel homeless because the Republican Party isn't really economically left. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=476.44s)]
*  And the Democratic Party, I don't know what they stand for. But I know- [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=482.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=486.36s)]
*  I know where I stand on the issues and I'm trying to kind of figure out what your real political [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=486.76s)]
*  identity is outside of your personal experiences. Sorry. If I were to boil it down, I would just be, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=490.92s)]
*  I would identify myself as a conservative environmentalist. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=498.92s)]
*  I care deeply, deeply about the environment. It's like my reason for being almost. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=503.0s)]
*  I'm a dedicated environmentalist and have been my entire life. It's my number one issue. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=510.6s)]
*  I do want to say one thing though, having been on the inside, another reason why I had to leave was [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=514.9200000000001s)]
*  a deception on many different issues. I saw that they were lying about Biden's age. And when I did [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=519.64s)]
*  in 2022, that's when they first started really lying about it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=526.5200000000001s)]
*  Gunn and Hogan were aggressively lying about it. I tried, I leaked to the press that they were. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=531.4000000000001s)]
*  And I did everything I could. But you would be ostracized, you would be destroyed [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=536.36s)]
*  if you dared to say that Biden had cognitive decline. They just would not allow you to say, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=542.84s)]
*  you couldn't even question internally. But that's all donors were talking about. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=547.8000000000001s)]
*  All of us knew what was going on. It was like an emperor has no clothes situation. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=552.2800000000001s)]
*  And then we all had to pretend that Biden was some like God, this demigod who was [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=556.6s)]
*  so magnanimous and couldn't do wrong. And then he leaves. And on the last day pardons his entire [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=561.08s)]
*  family. It's just so destructive to all of our institutions and undermines any arguments about [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=567.08s)]
*  Trump being corrupt when you can just point to Biden doing the same thing essentially. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=573.0s)]
*  So I'm just sick and tired of the blatant hypocrisy, the ex-communication tactics. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=578.2s)]
*  The fact that you can't ask any questions. I tried to reform the party from within, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=584.68s)]
*  but they wouldn't have it. They banned me. The first moment, within a week of me asking questions, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=590.36s)]
*  I was taken off all the lists. And at that time, I was just asking questions. I wasn't even [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=596.04s)]
*  criticizing. And they wouldn't even hear it. It was just unbelievable that they were so quick [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=600.8399999999999s)]
*  to ostracize me just for raising questions. After I raised millions for them, after I organized, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  after I gave everything, I gave everything I had to the party. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=613.0s)]
*  But even over this past year, my mind was starting to change. I just didn't want anything to do [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=618.36s)]
*  with a lot of their policies. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=623.48s)]
*  Yeah, Lindy, I'm continuing to be curious about the fundraising because it wouldn't have occurred [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=625.32s)]
*  to me to become a fundraiser at all for either party. So how did that come about? Where did you [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=632.04s)]
*  raise the money from? Why did you go in that direction? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=637.8s)]
*  First, I wanna say once and for all that I wasn't paid a single dime. People say that I was a [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=643.32s)]
*  consultant or I was just grifting off the Democratic Party. I'm a donor. I give. I raise money and I [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=647.88s)]
*  give. I do not take. I haven't been paid a single dime. I did get care packages with cookies and [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=655.48s)]
*  stuff. I guess if you count that as payment, then fine. I don't even eat cookies. I gave them away. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=662.36s)]
*  But I was not paid to do this. I did this because I wanted to. They recruited me in 2022. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=666.92s)]
*  They came over to my home, actually. It was pretty aggressive. And they asked me to base [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=674.04s)]
*  because I ran for Congress and I was able to raise a sizable sum then. So they saw that I [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  had a record. They recruited me to be a part of the National Finance Committee. And you had to [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=683.8s)]
*  raise millions of dollars to qualify for that. And that became my world, like my friends. And [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=688.68s)]
*  I'm kind of introvert. They were just my entire world. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=694.04s)]
*  They were the only friends I knew, essentially. It's actually kind of sad and that I've had to [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=697.8s)]
*  rethink everything. Yeah. So it sounds a little skull and bones at the time if you're on the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=703.8s)]
*  shoulder. Okay, we're gonna ask you to raise them. Yeah, it's very one on one. And [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  having been recruited, I've then recruited others. So it is very skull and bones. It's actually a [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=715.4s)]
*  great analogy. And so they recruit you and then you recruit your friends. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=720.76s)]
*  And it's kind of this pyramid scheme. And then the higher you go, the more access you have. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=725.64s)]
*  And so I ended up raising millions. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=731.8s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Lindy, that's super important. So look, obviously you run in a [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=733.4s)]
*  wealthy circle, right? If I went to go recruit money from my friends, I'd raise 50 bucks, 75 bucks, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=738.36s)]
*  maybe a couple of them, right? And then God bless, etc. But so that's interesting that if we're being [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=743.72s)]
*  honest about it in this wealthy class of folks, they're getting recruited for the Democratic [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=750.6s)]
*  Party, the Republican Party. That's like a common occurrence. The rest of us are totally unaware of. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=755.24s)]
*  So that's already interesting. But you said- [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=760.52s)]
*  I guess it's normal to me, so I don't even realize it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=763.96s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah, that's so normal to you. For the rest of us, we're totally unfamiliar with that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=766.2s)]
*  And it feels like there's a little bit of a Scientology kind of thing going on here where [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=771.96s)]
*  you move up the ranks. So if you move up the ranks, what extra access do you get? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=775.32s)]
*  I wish I could show. I actually have a PDF that details exactly what you get. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=782.0400000000001s)]
*  For example, at the convention- What'd you say? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=786.6800000000001s)]
*  Can you send that to us, that PDF? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=790.2s)]
*  Can I send it to you after and you can show it to me? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=793.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=795.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't know. It's somewhere in my emails. But let me just describe it now. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=796.6800000000001s)]
*  At the convention, there were different gradations. If you were to raise 100,000, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=801.08s)]
*  I think it was like, you get to go to an event with the president, like the bare minimum. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=806.36s)]
*  But if you raise 2 million, I think was the highest, you got your VIP skybox, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=811.32s)]
*  you got your own lounge, you got to meet privately with Harris after her speech. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=818.44s)]
*  They laid it out so carefully for you. And even at the time, I was like, isn't this [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=823.32s)]
*  isn't this blatant pay to play? I even raised concerns. I was like, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=828.52s)]
*  you don't want this floating around, do you? Because they laid it out so clearly. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=831.4799999999999s)]
*  It was like legalized bribery. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=835.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly what it is. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=837.88s)]
*  And it felt so wrong at the time too. But I'm sure both parties do it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=839.24s)]
*  I haven't obviously seen that Republican, I wasn't part of the Republican convention, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=844.52s)]
*  but I'm assuming they had something similar. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=848.52s)]
*  Yeah, Lindy, there's absolutely no question that both parties do it. Yes, 100%. They both do it, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=850.28s)]
*  no question. That's partly why they're called the Uniparty. Which leads me to my last question. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=856.2s)]
*  Genuinely curious about this too, Lindy. So why go all the way? Why not, okay, for example, I'm [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=862.6s)]
*  horrified by Democratic Party leadership. You say you'd get excommunicated, etc. If you [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=870.12s)]
*  challenged Biden's age and competence, I lived all that. I did it, excommunicated in every possible [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=877.4000000000001s)]
*  way, etc. But that didn't make me like Trump anymore. So yeah, Biden's terrible, Harris was [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=884.36s)]
*  terrible. The corruption in the Democratic Party is terrible, but the corruption in the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=892.04s)]
*  Republican Party is at a minimum just as terrible. So why go all the way to Trump and Magna? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=895.24s)]
*  Bruce, I didn't intend for any of this to happen. I was recruited by the Republican Party, I guess. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=901.32s)]
*  I guess this is kind of like what we were saying before. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=908.2s)]
*  Well, they're smart. Can I just interject before you finish? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=911.0s)]
*  Because I do want to hear what you have to say. But Republicans understand how to build power. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=914.2800000000001s)]
*  And so while Democrats can't wait to purge you, Republicans are waiting to take you in. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=919.48s)]
*  Because they want to build coalitions and they want to win. And I think that's what happened in [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=926.36s)]
*  this last election cycle. So can you talk a little bit about how they recruited you? What do you mean [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  by that? It happened almost immediately. By the way, over the last couple weeks though, I've had to [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=934.44s)]
*  take a step back because the far right fringe of the Republican Party, honestly, it's been miserable. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=940.04s)]
*  It's probably been the most difficult time of my life. And this past week, I was under so much [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=948.6s)]
*  stress. I was spitting blood. So I'm not even sure. I'm in a very difficult place right now. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=953.96s)]
*  And as you said, I'm kind of, I'm without a home. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=961.72s)]
*  I, on the one hand, I'm being attacked for leaving, but how do you stay in an abusive [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=965.64s)]
*  relationship? And then the family that I'm trying to join is abusing me too. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=971.88s)]
*  Well, Lindy, let me just give you a word of advice. Because I'm obviously going through [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=975.8s)]
*  something very similar because I disagree with some of what's been going on with the Democratic [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=981.8s)]
*  Party. But I think what guides me is my own moral foundation, but also where I stand principally [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=986.68s)]
*  on the issues. And so if my principles guide me, I'm not gonna be wooed by either political party. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=996.5999999999999s)]
*  And so if for the time being, I'm politically homeless, it does suck. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  But I'd rather be an independent voter and make decisions as the elections come rather than [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1009.4799999999999s)]
*  constantly declare my loyalty to the Democrats when, time and time again, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1016.6800000000001s)]
*  they've disappointed me at best or infuriated me with their corruption at worst. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1021.72s)]
*  Yeah, or the Republicans. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1026.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1028.04s)]
*  But Lindy, I just wanna go back and let you finish. So how did they recruit you? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1028.44s)]
*  A number of people in the leadership reached out to me very graciously [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1033.96s)]
*  in a very human way that I never got from the Democrats. And I've been with the Democrats for [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1039.96s)]
*  15 years. I never got them out of, it was just like they understood. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1044.04s)]
*  These are individuals, I don't wanna put a target on their backs because they get harassed because [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1051.32s)]
*  of me. But they reached out to me because I did see that I was in pain. And it's been very hard. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1056.44s)]
*  And I do wanna say I know exactly where I stand on issues. The problem is I'm right kind of dead [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1064.2s)]
*  in the center. I think a lot of Americans are. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1069.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1072.52s)]
*  I think a lot of Americans are. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1073.24s)]
*  Right, so it's very difficult. And I'm in Philadelphia where there's a 1 to 7 or 1 to 8 [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1075.8799999999999s)]
*  voter registration. No one talks to me anymore because they're just so shocked [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1082.12s)]
*  that I'm conservative. But again, it's just been very difficult. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1091.8s)]
*  I don't know what else to do really other than to just keep telling the truth and just being who I [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1096.44s)]
*  am. It's just been very harrowing that people lie about me. And it's hard to prove a counterfactual. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1103.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1112.44s)]
*  And they just, I'm sorry? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1113.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, look, been there. So we know how you feel. People lie about us all the time. And [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1115.3200000000002s)]
*  if you try to prove them wrong, they say, you're being defensive. And it goes in loops, right? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1122.3600000000001s)]
*  So but I'm curious about the other thing that you said. How has the far ripened terrible to you? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1127.48s)]
*  If I vocalize their lies, I give them more air time. But I'm sure you can just, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1132.0400000000002s)]
*  they say these very despicable things about me that are entirely not true. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1138.8400000000001s)]
*  And they will never forget some of them. Most of them have been amazing. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1144.44s)]
*  I just wanna say, but there's this fringe that just can never forgive me for being who I am. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1148.52s)]
*  And they're upset that I'm getting air time and they're not. They feel like I'm jumping the line. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1155.6399999999999s)]
*  They even said so. This is not me extrapolating or imagining. They said this. They said, we've been [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1159.8s)]
*  mad at this entire time. But why are you putting this person on air and she's just been here [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1165.08s)]
*  for a little while? So they feel like I usurp their role. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1170.12s)]
*  And I just wanna say that I'm not here to take anything from anybody. We can all coexist. I don't [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1174.52s)]
*  want a job in the Trump administration. You couldn't pay me to work in the government. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1179.72s)]
*  I'm okay with being who I am. I don't need to be on anyone's payroll. I just wanna be myself. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1183.4s)]
*  I care about the environment. I care about social conservative values. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1189.72s)]
*  That's pretty much it. I care about our country. I would do anything for America. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1193.3200000000002s)]
*  And so for these people to accuse me of being a traitor to our country is just so obscene. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1197.64s)]
*  It blows my mind. Sometimes I'm just stunned. I'm just stunned that it's happening. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1202.76s)]
*  Look, did it get racial? Again, it's not everybody. You're just those folks who- [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1209.0s)]
*  Yes, I can't even say it because it's just so horrible. And if I say, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1213.8s)]
*  the political trope is if you're explaining you're losing. And it's like the Streisand effect. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1219.48s)]
*  I don't even wanna repeat it. It's so bad. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1224.2s)]
*  Yep, I get it. So I wanna come back to the final question that I had theoretically. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1226.12s)]
*  Final backbam, which is, so but why then race for either side? Why not just say, hey, look, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1232.12s)]
*  these MAGA guys aren't for me either and the Democrats aren't for me. And I'm in no man's [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1239.2399999999998s)]
*  land and I'll wait for someone that resonates with me. But I'm not gonna go help MAGA because [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1244.04s)]
*  there's a lot of things I disagree with them on. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1251.2399999999998s)]
*  Well, I actually agree with them basically on almost every social issue, I think, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1253.88s)]
*  except the environment. And right now, this is also just something that I happen to be really [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1260.52s)]
*  good at and enjoy. It's just what I do. It's just very easy. I know people say that fundraising is [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1266.68s)]
*  very hard, but I happen to have a really, it's just very enjoyable. It's like a game. It's almost [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1271.96s)]
*  like gamification for me. I've been doing it for a decade. I did it for my university before I [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1277.72s)]
*  entered politics. It's just something that I do. It's just fun for me. I know that it sounds [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1285.24s)]
*  insane. I can tell you're good at it, Lindy. I can. I can tell you're good at it and I don't [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1289.64s)]
*  begrudge you for enjoying something that you're good at doing. I would say though that it's likely [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1293.08s)]
*  that you're feeling what you're feeling right now and being politically homeless because of how much [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1300.04s)]
*  that money has destroyed our political system and incentivized our politicians on both sides [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1304.52s)]
*  of the political aisle to basically F us day in and day out on behalf of their corporate donors. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1310.76s)]
*  So I think there are other areas where you can fundraise and excel at it and it would actually [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1316.68s)]
*  do good. I just don't think it's helpful in the political realm, but that's just me. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1322.68s)]
*  But thank you. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1326.36s)]
*  I do want to say one thing. My donors are not corporate. These are like everyday Americans in [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1327.16s)]
*  a variety of industries. They're not from corporations. And I want to say, I agree with [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1331.96s)]
*  you, but one party cannot unilaterally disarm. Both have to at the same time. So until both [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1338.52s)]
*  parties reform at the same time, until we do something about Citizens United, it doesn't [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1344.76s)]
*  make sense for one party to say, okay, we're not going to do this anymore. But yeah, both parties, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1349.08s)]
*  it's just especially with the advent of super PACs just been insane. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1356.1200000000001s)]
*  I've had people give tens of millions to PACs like Future Forward and whatnot. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1359.8s)]
*  So they're not wealthy. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1365.48s)]
*  No, they're wealthy. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1367.32s)]
*  Yes, but I don't mean that they're not corporate. A lot of them, it doesn't, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1368.9199999999998s)]
*  they could be any, like I had someone who owns a vineyard. They're not necessarily corporations. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1372.2s)]
*  Got it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1377.24s)]
*  It could be anything. Some of them are immigrants who worked hard all their lives to get here. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1377.8s)]
*  But they're not, I don't mean they're not part of huge conglomerates or anything. At least my [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1383.3999999999999s)]
*  donors are not. I can't speak to everybody. But- [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1387.24s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1390.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I understand. All right, look, really interesting perspective. Hang in there. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1391.88s)]
*  And- I'll send you the graph that I talked about. I'll send it to your producer. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1396.6s)]
*  It lays it out. You'll be stunned to see what the incentives are, I think. It's very, very eye opening. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1401.0s)]
*  Thank you, Lindy. All right, Lindy Lee. Thank you for joining us. Appreciate it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1406.28s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1409.64s)]
*  Totally not true. But it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kov0DF4na8&t=1412.76s)]
