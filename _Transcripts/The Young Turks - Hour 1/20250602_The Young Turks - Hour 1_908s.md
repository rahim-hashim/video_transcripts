"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday hammered the Trump administration for threatening to arrest Democratic members of Congress, saying such a move would constitute a clear case of executive overreach.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a red line,‚Äù Jeffries told reporters in the Capitol. ‚ÄúThey know better than to go down that road.‚Äù
Three House Democrats from New Jersey faced off against law enforcement officials outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility last week in Newark, N.J., where they were attempting to inspect a migrant detention center. They were joined by Newark‚Äôs Democratic mayor, Ras Baraka, who was arrested on charges of trespassing ‚Äî an allegation he denies. "

# Hakeem Jeffries Chokes After Trump Calls His Bluff
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU)
*  Your statement the other day after there was this incident in New York, you said they better not touch our mountainous correct [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=0.0s)]
*  What happens if they were to go and arrest these members or if they were trying to sanction them during the House of Representatives? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=5.76s)]
*  They'll find out what would you do? I mean, of course, I mean, it does not broach a don't find out [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=11.4s)]
*  Doesn't that to go across a red line? I know you previously warned that the administration charging members of Congress was a quote red line [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=16.88s)]
*  What are you doing now that the red line you talked about has apparently been crossed? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=24.96s)]
*  We will make that decision in a time place and manner of our choosing but the response will be continuous [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=29.4s)]
*  And it will meet the moment that is required [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=37.72s)]
*  What exactly does that mean? Have you not decided how to respond? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=41.86s)]
*  It means that he hasn't decided how to respond that was House Minority Leader [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=45.8s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries who just had his bluff called by President Donald Trump and his Department of Justice and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=52.56s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries while he issued a threat [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=60.6s)]
*  Apparently didn't really have any plan or strategy in place to respond to Trump calling his bluff now [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  This story begins with the threat that Jeffries made following [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=71.4s)]
*  You know this scuffle that took place [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=75.8s)]
*  Involving a freshman Democratic congresswoman by the name of LaMonica McGyver [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=78.76s)]
*  Now according to the New York Times the Justice Department ended up arresting her and charged [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=83.48s)]
*  Representative McGyver with two counts of assault after a clash with immigration officers outside a Newark Detention Center [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  According to a criminal complaint. She quote slammed her forearm and quote into an immigration agent and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Tried to restrain him McGyver has maintained her innocence and dismissed the charges as political intimidation [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  Now footage from the chaotic event does show her doing part of what she was accused of so I want to just quickly go [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=112.04s)]
*  to that video [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=119.48s)]
*  Yes, let's take a look at that footage and then I'll give you more [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  So [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  The footage shows her pushing him with her forearm. I don't know if that's a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=144.32s)]
*  Prosecutable offense. Okay. It does seem like this is politically motivated [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  I didn't see any evidence that she was trying to restrain the ICE officer, but nonetheless she's been arrested [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=152.4s)]
*  And she's been charged. Okay now [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=159.44s)]
*  What are you gonna do Hakeem Jeffries? Okay, so [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=161.96s)]
*  Considering the Trump pardon by the way all of the January 6th rioters including those who were caught on camera viciously [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=166.28s)]
*  Attacking Capitol Police officers. I'm yeah, I'm willing to believe this arrest and and these charges are politically motivated [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=172.52s)]
*  But when the Trump administration was merely threatening to arrest McGyver Hakeem Jeffries issued a threat to the Trump administration during the press conference [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=179.88s)]
*  Let's take a quick look at that your statement the other day [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  After there was this incident in New York, you said they better not touch our members correct [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=190.4s)]
*  What happens if they were to go and arrest these members or if they were trying to sanction them during the House of Representatives? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=194.4s)]
*  They'll find out what would you do though? I mean [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=200.4s)]
*  Of course, I mean, it does not broach a don't find out doesn't that go across a red line. What's the what's the red line though? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=202.4s)]
*  I mean, I know we have it's a red line. It's very clear [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=209.4s)]
*  First of all, I think that the so-called Homeland Security spokesperson [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=212.4s)]
*  Is a joke [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=218.44s)]
*  It's a joke [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=220.44s)]
*  They know better [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=222.44s)]
*  Than to go down that road and it's been made loudly [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=224.44s)]
*  And abundantly clear [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=229.44s)]
*  To the Trump administration [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=231.44s)]
*  We're not going to be intimidated [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=234.44s)]
*  By their tactics to try to force [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=237.44s)]
*  Principled opposition from not standing up to the government [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=243.44s)]
*  And from not standing up to their extremism [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=247.48s)]
*  Now since then not only was Congresswoman MacGyver [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=249.48s)]
*  You know arrested and charged [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=253.48s)]
*  There was also this fascinating raid that took place in Congressman Jerry Nadler's office [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=255.48s)]
*  One of his aides, by the way, was put in handcuffs [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=261.48s)]
*  And apparently [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=265.48s)]
*  The federal agent was heard on video saying you're harboring of rioters in the office [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=267.48s)]
*  The federal agent whose name tag and officer number are not visible in the video says to a member of Nadler staff [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  There were no riots reported, by the way, on Wednesday at the federal building on Varick Street [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  Though protesters and immigrant rights advocates gathered inside and outside the building earlier in the day [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  So the federal agent said they were there to keep the staffers in the office safe because of the riot that was taking place [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  There was no riot [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  The agents entered Nadler's office because they had been told that protesters were there and were concerned for their safety [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=304.56s)]
*  According to a statement on Saturday from the Department of Homeland Security [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=312.56s)]
*  When they arrived one individual became verbally confrontational and physically blocked access to the office [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=316.56s)]
*  The statement said that person, an aide to the congressman, was detained so that officers could complete their safety check according to the statement [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=321.56s)]
*  So with that incident in mind and with McIver's arrest in mind [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=330.6s)]
*  Okay, well they F'd around, what are they going to find out, Hakeem Jeffries? And here's what he said [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=334.6s)]
*  In terms of how we will respond to what Trump and the administration has endeavored to do [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=339.6s)]
*  We will make that decision in a time, place and manner of our choosing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=345.6s)]
*  But the response will be continuous and it will meet the moment that is required [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=350.6s)]
*  What exactly does that mean? Have you not decided how to respond? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=357.64000000000004s)]
*  We've publicly responded in a variety of different ways [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  We haven't let our foot off the gas pedal [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=367.64000000000004s)]
*  In terms of additional things that may take place with respect to our congressional oversight authority and capacity [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=369.64000000000004s)]
*  We will respond in a time, place and manner of our choosing if this continues to happen [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=377.64000000000004s)]
*  So nothing, let me just decode that for you, nothing [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=385.68s)]
*  There was no strategy, there was no plan, caught flat-footed [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=388.68s)]
*  Looks like Trump F'd around and didn't find out anything other than the fact that Democrats have no plan [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=391.68s)]
*  Go ahead, Cenk [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=398.68s)]
*  No, he found out that Hakeem Jeffries is totally and utterly incompetent, that's what he found out [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=399.68s)]
*  So if you say do it and you'll find out, you better have a plan, brother [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=404.68s)]
*  I mean, God, that is so pathetic not to have a plan [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=408.68s)]
*  Then on top of that, you said it was a red line [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=412.72s)]
*  And you said that was very clear [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=415.72s)]
*  Yeah, the only thing clear about red lines is that if you draw one and then you don't do anything [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=417.72s)]
*  You're universally considered a clown, okay [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=423.72s)]
*  And then you replace the red line with a red bulbous nose [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=427.72s)]
*  And then you put a flower on your lapel and squirt water out of it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=430.72s)]
*  And big floppy shoes for you, okay [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=434.72s)]
*  So he said it will be in a time, place and manner that we choose [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=437.76000000000005s)]
*  When are you going to choose? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=442.76000000000005s)]
*  Because you haven't fought him yet [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=443.76000000000005s)]
*  And he said it will be continuous [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=445.76000000000005s)]
*  What do you mean continuous? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=447.76000000000005s)]
*  Do you think you're fighting him now? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=449.76000000000005s)]
*  Because the rest of us don't see anything [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  Democratic polling is down to 19% [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=453.76000000000005s)]
*  Oh, you want to go to that video? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=456.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, hold on, hold on, no, no, no [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  I want to beat up on this total lack of a leader more [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=459.76000000000005s)]
*  I will allow it, go ahead [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=463.76000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so this is all they know better, do they? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=464.8s)]
*  I don't think they know better at all, okay? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=468.8s)]
*  Look, I'm not letting Trump off the hook [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=470.8s)]
*  What are you doing arresting people for that are members of Congress? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=472.8s)]
*  And for all the MAGA who complain about lawfare [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=476.8s)]
*  I know what aboutism [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=478.8s)]
*  So now you're like, yeah, we're going to do it to you [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=480.8s)]
*  Does that make you principle? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=482.8s)]
*  Does that make you better? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=483.8s)]
*  Even if you were right, which you're not, okay? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=484.8s)]
*  And this representative, I saw that video [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=486.8s)]
*  They slow it down and it looks like she's pushing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=488.8s)]
*  And I don't think she's pushing [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=491.8s)]
*  I saw her getting pushed into the guard [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  So who is pushing her from behind? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  We didn't see that part of the video [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  And when you're falling, what do you do? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  You brace yourself because you're worried you're going to fall [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  Whatever, even if she did push with her forearm [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  It was absolute chaos, okay? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  There were hands being thrown all over the place [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  Like arresting her for this is obviously [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  She's getting pushed from the back [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  If it was a Republican, I would say the same exact thing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=513.84s)]
*  You're going to arrest somebody over that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=516.84s)]
*  You're going to arrest that person [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=518.84s)]
*  You're going to arrest somebody over that [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=520.88s)]
*  You're going to arrest a US representative over that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=521.88s)]
*  When they're getting pushed from behind [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=524.88s)]
*  No, I would say don't do that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=526.88s)]
*  It has to be a significant crime [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=528.88s)]
*  Like taking home the top-seeker documents [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=530.88s)]
*  And putting it into your bathroom [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=533.88s)]
*  Where anybody can come in and take it [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=535.88s)]
*  Or maybe, anyway, you get it, okay? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=537.88s)]
*  So, all right, so Hakeem, back to Hakeem Jeffries [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=540.88s)]
*  So Trump shouldn't do any of this [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=543.88s)]
*  They shouldn't arrest the congressman [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=544.88s)]
*  Disaster, right? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=545.88s)]
*  But you knew that there was a likelihood [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=546.88s)]
*  An extremely high likelihood they were going to do that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=549.92s)]
*  Did you really think that if you went out there [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=552.92s)]
*  And you were like, oh, there's a red line, dude [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=554.92s)]
*  You'll find out that Trump would be like, oh, Hakeem said [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=556.92s)]
*  There's a red line, I better not cross it [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=560.92s)]
*  They must have laughed their ass off at you, Hakeem Jeffries [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=562.92s)]
*  In fact- [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=566.92s)]
*  Red line, where's the red line, huh? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=567.92s)]
*  And then they do this and you go, well, we're going to do a time [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=569.92s)]
*  Place if it continues to happen [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=574.92s)]
*  Did you notice what I'm saying? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=576.92s)]
*  Yeah, of course I did [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=577.92s)]
*  So, okay, so you didn't have a plan [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  You didn't have a plan for when it happened [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=579.9599999999999s)]
*  Now we're supposed to believe you [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=581.9599999999999s)]
*  That you have a plan [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  If it continues to happen [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  Embarrassing [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=585.9599999999999s)]
*  Super embarrassing [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  Guys, if you want to know why, okay? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=587.9599999999999s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries is a corporate robot [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=589.9599999999999s)]
*  And he went after the election [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=592.9599999999999s)]
*  And did the thing that he's known for [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=594.9599999999999s)]
*  Which is he went and begged donors [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  For not just money, but direction [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  He went to Silicon Valley and he's like, guys, what should I do? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  What should I do, boss? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  And the donors were like, we already switched to Trump [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=607.0s)]
*  You're useless, right? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=609.0s)]
*  So he came home weeping [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=610.0s)]
*  And he's like, I don't know what to do [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=612.0s)]
*  How about you make a plan? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=614.0s)]
*  How about you make a plan? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=616.0s)]
*  No, no, for a Democratic leader [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=618.0s)]
*  That is too much to ask for [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=620.0s)]
*  Jesus, man, pathetic in every way [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=622.0s)]
*  So look, sometimes we get backlash for being as harsh [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=626.0s)]
*  Toward the current Democratic Party as we've been [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=630.0s)]
*  But for those who feel irritated by us being as harsh [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=632.0s)]
*  As we've been, just know that you are part of a tiny [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=636.04s)]
*  Dwindling group of Democratic voters [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=640.04s)]
*  Don't believe me? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=642.04s)]
*  Here's some evidence [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=643.04s)]
*  Donald Trump actually is the most unpopular president [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=644.04s)]
*  At this point of a presidency in American history [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=648.04s)]
*  The American people have rejected this approach [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=652.04s)]
*  And we as congressional Democrats will continue to reject this approach [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=655.04s)]
*  Mr. Leader, you brought up polls, so let me tell you about [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=659.04s)]
*  A new one that just came out here at CNN this morning [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=662.04s)]
*  It shows that only 19% of Americans say that your party can get things done [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=665.0799999999999s)]
*  36 say the same about Republicans [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=670.0799999999999s)]
*  And just 16% say your party has strong leaders [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  40% feel the same about Republicans [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=677.0799999999999s)]
*  Oops [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=681.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, so credit to Dana Bash [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  It's not personal, she's terrible on the issue of Israel and Gaza [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  Terrible about our civil liberties [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  If anyone dares to criticize Israel [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=691.0799999999999s)]
*  But there, that was good, aggressive follow-up questions [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=694.12s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=697.12s)]
*  And you should do it to both sides, Republicans and Democrats [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=698.12s)]
*  And the follow-ups lead us to realize that Hakeem Jeffries has no idea what he's doing [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=701.12s)]
*  I just want to say two more things that he said [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=706.12s)]
*  He said, we haven't taken our foot off the gas pedal [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=709.12s)]
*  What gas pedal? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=712.12s)]
*  No, but that's the amazing thing, guys [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=714.12s)]
*  They think that they have their foot solidly on the gas pedal right now [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=717.12s)]
*  But with what? What are you doing? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=721.16s)]
*  And another thing he said was, we will continue to meet the moment [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=724.16s)]
*  No, brother, this is the moment [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=728.16s)]
*  You said that if she got arrested, that you would then, it would be a red line [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=730.16s)]
*  And you would meet that moment [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=734.16s)]
*  And you met the moment and you got a big pie in your face [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=736.16s)]
*  And then it's dripping off your face now [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=739.16s)]
*  And you're like, I met the moment [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=741.16s)]
*  I found out, I should make a plan next time [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=743.16s)]
*  Okay, look, I had Representative Cisneros here [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=746.16s)]
*  The other day, I interviewed him, you should check that out on YouTube [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=750.1999999999999s)]
*  And I asked him, is there big debates in the caucus, Democratic caucus, about what to do [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  Like, hey, every representative of X thinks that, representative of Y thinks that [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=758.1999999999999s)]
*  Leader Z thinks this, and then they hash it out [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  No, there's barely any conversation at all [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=764.1999999999999s)]
*  They're meeting the moment, Cenk, how dare you [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  They're meeting the moment [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  Totally useless [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=771.1999999999999s)]
*  Look, I don't feel joy in giving you guys the truth about this [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=772.1999999999999s)]
*  But it is the truth [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=776.1999999999999s)]
*  And I've just personally, I've given up on having any hope that the current Democratic Party [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=778.24s)]
*  Has the competence or even the will to represent us effectively and to fight for us [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=785.24s)]
*  Period, end of story [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=792.24s)]
*  And this has been going on for a long time, this isn't a new development [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=794.24s)]
*  The new development is I finally accepted Democrats for who they are [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=797.24s)]
*  Feckless, weak, self-interested, and addicted to money [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=801.24s)]
*  And that's it [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=806.24s)]
*  Yeah, so look, this is why I do the political things that I do [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=807.28s)]
*  And I know sometimes it drives you crazy [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=810.28s)]
*  It does, yeah [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=811.28s)]
*  But the reason for it is because no one else is doing it [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=812.28s)]
*  So this is not empty criticism [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=815.28s)]
*  Okay, I co-founded Rebellion PAC [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=817.28s)]
*  And right now Rebellion PAC is running populist within the Democratic Party [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=820.28s)]
*  And so we're running in red districts and purple districts [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=825.28s)]
*  And we plan on beating Republicans [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=828.28s)]
*  Why? Well, what's our plan? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=830.28s)]
*  Did we come up with one? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=832.28s)]
*  Yes [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=833.28s)]
*  Believe it or not [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=834.28s)]
*  People can make plans [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=835.3199999999999s)]
*  I know that's a giant shock to Democratic leadership [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=836.3199999999999s)]
*  The plan is run on the six most popular Democratic policies [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzP9-cHmrGU&t=839.3199999999999s)]
