"Trump is "completely underwater" & has broken his own record with the lowest net approval at this point among independents (-22 pts). 

His economic net approval with indies at this pt is so low (-29 pts) it has "no historical analogy". 

Most indies (66%) oppose the new tariffs"

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Trump's Polls Are CRATERING!!!!!
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM)
*  Independence feel that Donald Trump has vacated the center of the electric catering to his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=0.0s)]
*  base. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=5.14s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Well, let's talk about the overall net approval ratings. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna look at the worst ever at this point in a presidency. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=9.0s)]
*  The old record among independents for the worst ever was Donald Trump back in 2016, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  a net approval rating of minus 16 points. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=16.46s)]
*  While Donald Trump has broken his own record here, he now holds in this particular term, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=19.16s)]
*  the worst ever net approval rating at this point in a presidency among independents, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=24.68s)]
*  I get this, minus 22 points. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=30.08s)]
*  I like this guy, I like his energy, I like the way he talks. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=36.6s)]
*  But the numbers get even worse for Trump when you focus on the number one issue, the economy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=39.4s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=44.92s)]
*  Let's take a look at Trump's net approval rating on it and look at the trend line over [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  just the last few months. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=51.36s)]
*  If you go back to January, he was slightly above water with independents at plus one [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=52.76s)]
*  point. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=56.76s)]
*  Look at this drop, Kate, my, minus 29 points. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=57.76s)]
*  That's a 30 point drop in under three months of time. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=63.12s)]
*  If you go back to the record books, I simply put Kate Baldwin, can't find anything close [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=67.72s)]
*  to this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=72.2s)]
*  This is such a record that there is no historical analogy to be 29 points underwater on the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=73.2s)]
*  most important issue of the day with independents. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=79.0s)]
*  This right here, my dear friends, is political poison. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=81.98s)]
*  My God, no historical analogy, political poison. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=85.58s)]
*  What is behind these shockingly low numbers? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=90.5s)]
*  You probably won't be surprised to find out that it is Trump's tariffs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=93.56s)]
*  They are a huge factor in all of this because as I mentioned in the earlier story, there's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=97.18s)]
*  no one else to blame but Trump for this one. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=101.66s)]
*  So here's more from Enten. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  A clear plan for tariffs and trade among independents. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=106.42s)]
*  Look at this, 57% say no, he doesn't even have a clear plan for what he should be doing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=110.26s)]
*  with tariffs and trade. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=117.06s)]
*  And when asked whether or not they like the idea of additional tariffs, guess what percentage [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=118.86s)]
*  of independents say no, that they oppose it? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=123.48s)]
*  It is two thirds, it is 66% of independents who oppose new tariffs. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=126.36000000000001s)]
*  They don't like anything that's coming out of Donald Trump's right now, absent maybe [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=132.08s)]
*  immigration. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  When it comes to the economy, when it comes to overall, when it comes to tariff, it's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=137.14s)]
*  a threesome for negativity among independents. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=140.77999999999997s)]
*  They oppose, oppose, oppose. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=143.98s)]
*  All right, so those numbers might look bad for Donald Trump, but today Enten actually [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=146.77999999999997s)]
*  reported on some good news for the president. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=152.7s)]
*  So let's watch that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  I hear all these stories, all these articles, all the Trump voters, they regret what they [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=158.22s)]
*  did back in 2024. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm here to tell you, very few of them regret what they did back in 2024. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=165.5s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  Trump voters looking back at 2024, we got a new poll out, the poll was conducted this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=171.82s)]
*  month. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  What percentage would change their vote to a different candidate? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  We're talking just 2%, just 2%, that's not even a wide spot on the road. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=179.5s)]
*  And then you ask, okay, the same question to Kamala Harris voters, and it turns out [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=184.54s)]
*  the numbers are rather similar. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=188.26s)]
*  So if there was a repeat, if folks got to be able to redo their vote that they had back [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=189.8s)]
*  in 2024, would the result be any different? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=194.0s)]
*  I doubt it would be. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=197.11999999999998s)]
*  Well, in February of 2017, 4%, 4% of Trump voters say they'd shift their vote. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  That's actually slightly more than the 3% this time around. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  Was, I think on the left, we want to hear that these Trump people, we want to believe [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  that these Trump people are finally seeing the error of their ways. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=216.04s)]
*  We are seeing some stories like that coming out on social media, TikTok, on X, wherever. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=219.72s)]
*  But on the whole, Trump supporters still very much support Trump. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=225.28s)]
*  They still believe that he's gonna pull out a win at the end of this, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=229.12s)]
*  Sometimes in our leftist bubble, sometimes it can seem like that's not the case. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  But the reality is that it's very, very hard, especially at this point, the way politics [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=238.12s)]
*  is so polarized in this country. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=242.62s)]
*  It is very rare to see somebody completely switch parties or completely switch ideologies. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=245.6s)]
*  And also, there's the sunk cost fallacy that these people have invested so much of their [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=251.56s)]
*  time and energy, their entire personalities into supporting Trump. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=256.04s)]
*  That is a huge ask for people on the left to be like, can you just switch over? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=261.04s)]
*  Do you finally get it? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=265.2s)]
*  Do you think that there ever will be a mass exodus of people from supporting Trump to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=267.2s)]
*  not supporting Trump? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=272.48s)]
*  Or do you think that the left just needs to let go of that hope and move on and try [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=273.6s)]
*  to figure something else out? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=278.0s)]
*  I think there's a few things at work here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=280.48s)]
*  Donald Trump is a singular figure in the sense that many of the people that vote for him, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=285.04s)]
*  just like him personally, they don't care about what the policy is or how he's gonna [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=292.56s)]
*  get there. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=299.72s)]
*  They just think he has a compelling personality. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=302.32s)]
*  It is a cult of personality. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=305.44s)]
*  And so again, folks gotta remember Biden's fortunes didn't turn until nine months into [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=307.78s)]
*  his presidency after the Afghanistan war pullout, which obviously all of us supported. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=314.92s)]
*  But he got killed in the media for this and it kinda never turned around for us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=322.8s)]
*  It's been basically three months of Donald Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=329.9s)]
*  It's very, very, very early in the game. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=332.97999999999996s)]
*  Another thing that people have to realize is much as we've, like everybody, experts, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=338.38s)]
*  laypeople, normal people, people with 401Ks, people with stock portfolios, etc., etc. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  As much as everybody can recognize that these policy ideas, especially as it pertains to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=351.62s)]
*  tariffs in the economy, are disastrous, the results haven't kicked in yet. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=358.9s)]
*  We haven't had mass layoffs yet. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=364.35999999999996s)]
*  We haven't had a stock market nosedive. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=366.7s)]
*  We haven't had tangible, okay, material effects of Trump's dumbheadedness yet. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=369.08s)]
*  And so to expect people to feel like, this guy's been a disaster when nothing's tangibly [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=379.17999999999995s)]
*  happened yet. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=384.42s)]
*  No government agency that Doge has cut funding to fail somebody yet. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=386.74s)]
*  This stuff hasn't happened yet. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=394.42s)]
*  There hasn't been some environmental disaster where the EPA could have stepped in and they [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=396.1s)]
*  didn't. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=401.06s)]
*  Or some kind of basically government oversight that wasn't in place because of Doge. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=402.46000000000004s)]
*  Or people's stock portfolio and retirements get tanked. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=409.06s)]
*  This stuff hasn't happened yet. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=412.88s)]
*  And so I do think it's pretty early. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=415.48s)]
*  And I think another example to think about is George W Bush in 2004, 2005 after destroying [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=417.46s)]
*  John Kerry, okay? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=427.36s)]
*  He got reelected, Republicans descended in both houses of Congress. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=429.2s)]
*  And it just looked like, wow, we're gonna be Republican from now until Kingdom come. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=435.98s)]
*  And then what happened? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=440.52s)]
*  Disastrous war in Iraq, okay? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=442.3s)]
*  Bush got cocky talking about privatizing social security, which obviously is a no-no. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=444.54s)]
*  Got creamed for it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=449.6s)]
*  Katrina response, disaster. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=451.24s)]
*  And then on and on and on and went until by the time Barack Obama and the Dems run against [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=453.78s)]
*  the Republicans in 2008, George Bush is widely seen as the worst president ever, okay? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=459.1s)]
*  He went from literally feeling like the Republicans were gonna have majorities forever to this [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=467.28s)]
*  guy is a disaster to the point that we elected the first Negro in the history of the country, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=474.02s)]
*  okay? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=479.78s)]
*  So folks need to realize that it's very early. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=480.78s)]
*  A lot of the horrible nature of Trump's policies have yet to be felt by everyday people. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=483.42s)]
*  But believe me, if this guy keeps it going with this China trade war, if he keeps it [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=490.78s)]
*  going with this hair brained, disgustingly evil immigration policy, if he keeps it going [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=496.94s)]
*  down this way, it's going to have an effect, I promise you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=503.7s)]
*  Yeah, I agree, but it is interesting because Trump supporters, they won't believe the bad [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=508.02s)]
*  things are happening until it happens to them directly sometimes, right? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=513.78s)]
*  They don't think that the economy tanking is a problem because their portfolios haven't [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=518.66s)]
*  been hit or their bank accounts or whatever. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=522.66s)]
*  But they will believe that terrorists are just running rampant around the country even [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=525.12s)]
*  though there hasn't been any reported terrorism, even though they haven't seen any terrorists, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=529.12s)]
*  or even though they haven't been personally terrorized by anyone really. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=533.48s)]
*  So they just pick and choose things. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=537.44s)]
*  And the reason why they do it is because, like you said, it is a cult of Trump's personality, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=539.96s)]
*  right? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=545.88s)]
*  They have to support him. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=546.88s)]
*  We're even seeing it from members of Congress, right? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=547.88s)]
*  Where they come out not to defend democracy, not to defend the country, not to defend their [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=550.88s)]
*  constituents, but to defend the president. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  That's not how this country is supposed to work. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=558.92s)]
*  And the Republicans, they do need to seriously start thinking about what's going to happen [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=561.08s)]
*  if and when this guy is out of there because presumably he'll be out of there within the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=564.92s)]
*  next four years. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  I guess we'll see what happens there. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mcN39VyxGM&t=571.04s)]
