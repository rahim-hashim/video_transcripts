# Republicans to Wildfire Victims: NO AID For You Unless...
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M)
*  You saying that California if they continue to aid and abet law breaking and harbor illegal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=0.0s)]
*  immigrants, money from DC gets cut off. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we're talking about conditions to this disaster. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=10.32s)]
*  Congressional Republicans are looking to punish Americans who lost everything in the recent [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=15.56s)]
*  wildfires in Southern California by withholding disaster relief aid unless the state govern [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  exactly the way that they want them to govern. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=27.64s)]
*  Which puts me in a really difficult situation because as everyone knows, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=31.12s)]
*  there is no love lost between me and Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=37.32s)]
*  I have been very critical of the democratic leadership in the state. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=40.28s)]
*  They have in fact mismanaged. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=45.16s)]
*  They have in fact failed to prepare the state for the winds that were coming, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=47.8s)]
*  the fire weather that we were all warned about a week prior to the devastating wildfires [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=53.6s)]
*  breaking out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=58.56s)]
*  But now the congressional Republicans are going beyond the mismanagement issues. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=60.24s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, I'm hearing them bring up all these other strings that they want [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  to attach to the relief aid. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=71.28s)]
*  And I just want to remind everyone that our taxes, everyone who works and pays taxes, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=74.08s)]
*  they are contributing to the federal resources that are supposed to be available if they [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=82.2s)]
*  lose everything as a result of a natural disaster. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  If they lose everything as a result of fires like the ones that broke out a week and a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=93.2s)]
*  half ago in Los Angeles. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=98.16s)]
*  So the idea that we keep paying our taxes and we can't rely on any federal relief if [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=100.88s)]
*  a natural disaster strikes just purely based on politics is infuriating. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=109.34s)]
*  So look, let's listen to the conversation between Sean Hannity and Republican House [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=114.74s)]
*  speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=120.66s)]
*  So you get a sense of what I'm talking about here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=121.66s)]
*  We're talking about conditions to this disaster. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=125.58s)]
*  Look, there are natural disasters, but there are manmade disasters as well and they made [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  terrible decisions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=132.26s)]
*  They knew exactly what they were doing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=134.14s)]
*  That reservoir outside Pacific Palisades, 117 million gallons, it was empty for a year. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=135.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=140.88s)]
*  They were trying to save a smelt fish or something. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=141.88s)]
*  I mean, their policies are upside down. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=143.2s)]
*  They made decisions that made that disaster exponentially worse. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=145.44s)]
*  And this is what the American taxpayers demanding of us everywhere else in the country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  Okay, there are things he said there that are true, but there's one major thing he said [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=155.32s)]
*  that is not true. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=161.6s)]
*  He's totally misinformed about and it's been kind of driving me crazy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=163.12s)]
*  The whole issue of preserving smelt, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=167.16s)]
*  The tiny little fish that they keep referring to. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=172.74s)]
*  That had no impact on the water supply in Southern California. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=175.22s)]
*  That is, in my opinion, an issue that needs to be addressed because we have not built [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=179.44s)]
*  water infrastructure to preserve water when it does rain. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=185.56s)]
*  And it's ridiculous that that's the case when we live in a drought prone state. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=190.14s)]
*  So that does impact parts of California, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=195.98s)]
*  The effort to save the smelt fish does impact the water supply in parts of California, but [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  not Southern California. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=204.89999999999998s)]
*  He is correct in noting that the Santa Inez reservoir in the Pacific Palisades was empty [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=206.73999999999998s)]
*  and had been empty for a year. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=213.48s)]
*  But it wasn't because of the smelt, okay? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=215.77999999999997s)]
*  It was empty because there was a tear on the floating cover of that reservoir. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=218.3s)]
*  And it takes forever to fix a damn thing in this state because of environmental regulations, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=224.74s)]
*  because of other regulations that are intentionally set to prevent the construction of new homes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=230.28s)]
*  Because let's keep it real, people wanna maintain the value of their homes. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=236.8s)]
*  And if you build more supply, then that might lower just for a brief period of time, the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=240.22s)]
*  value of their home. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=246.52s)]
*  That really is the center of a lot of the dysfunction that we see in California when [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=248.24s)]
*  it comes to regulations and red tape, preventing us from building things or fixing things. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  So that is a problem, okay? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=259.08s)]
*  Bringing up the reservoir, that's fine. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=261.32s)]
*  Bringing up the mismanagement leading up to the fire, that's fine. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=262.76s)]
*  I've spoken out against that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=265.76s)]
*  So if there's concern that the federal aid is going to be misspent, okay, or mismanaged [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=267.64s)]
*  by our politicians here in California, you could write the legislation or provide that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  aid ensuring that the money ends up in the hands of the very people who lost everything [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=282.72s)]
*  as a result of these fires. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=288.8s)]
*  But that's not the conversation we're having here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=290.8s)]
*  In fact, Mike Johnson wants to go further. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  And so before I get to Politico, let's take a look at the next video. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  Because here he talks about fire mismanagement, but then he brings up other issues. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=303.12s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=307.16s)]
*  Would conditions be tied to defund dismantle no bail laws? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=308.88s)]
*  I think all those issues have to be addressed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=313.0s)]
*  When you're talking about disaster aid, you don't want to leave the people who are really [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=315.44s)]
*  hurting without something because of the terrible political choices of their leaders. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=318.64s)]
*  But we've got to thread that needle the right way. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=322.92s)]
*  But I think that what we're talking about here is restoring common sense, even in the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=324.68s)]
*  state of California. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=328.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=329.4s)]
*  The responsibility we have, the responsibility we have, we're gonna do that very thing. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=330.4s)]
*  Okay, so to be fair to Mike Johnson, he's not the one who brought up policies like defund [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=334.67999999999995s)]
*  the police or bail reform in California. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=340.52s)]
*  Sean Hannity did. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  But to take that credit away from Mike Johnson, he agreed that those are the types of policies [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=345.28s)]
*  that they need to review in order to determine whether or not Californians who have paid into [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=350.0s)]
*  their federal taxes are deserving of disaster relief money. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=356.54s)]
*  And I think that's unacceptable. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=360.88s)]
*  I want to be clear that a lot of those policies I'm against. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=361.88s)]
*  I wasn't against in the beginning. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=366.9s)]
*  But once you saw the impact of some of those policies and how devastating they've been [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=369.3s)]
*  to cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, I am against those policies. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=373.1s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=377.26s)]
*  That's a completely separate issue from disaster relief aid. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=378.26s)]
*  The idea that Democrats would look at a state like North Carolina that suffered from hurricanes [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=382.06s)]
*  and severe weather conditions, people who lost everything in that state. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=388.92s)]
*  The idea that Democrats would say, we don't like how Republicans are governing that state. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=393.34s)]
*  And so we are going to hold federal relief money hostage. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=400.08s)]
*  And we're gonna use that as leverage to get local lawmakers in that state to change their [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=406.5s)]
*  policies on a whole litany of issues that aren't even related to hurricanes or natural [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=411.54s)]
*  disasters. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=418.46000000000004s)]
*  That is insane to me. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  I would be furious if Democrats did that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=420.46000000000004s)]
*  And I'm furious right now that Republicans are attempting to do this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=422.54s)]
*  And look, Mike Johnson argues, well, what? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=427.66s)]
*  In other cases, with Hurricane Katrina is a good example. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=431.1s)]
*  There were strings attached to that disaster relief money. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  No, there weren't. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=437.3s)]
*  What is he talking about? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=438.3s)]
*  Okay, let's get into the details about that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=440.46s)]
*  Because as far as conditioning relief following Hurricane Katrina goes, the hurricane made [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  landfall on August 29th, 2005. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=449.28s)]
*  The Senate quickly approved $10.5 billion in aid for the victims on September 1st, 2005. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=452.3s)]
*  So almost immediately, which was a good thing. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=460.18s)]
*  That's what you're supposed to do. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=462.62s)]
*  The House approved the measure the next day without any debate. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=464.5s)]
*  And then President Bush requested an additional $51.8 billion on September 7th. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=468.42s)]
*  Congress approved that funding package the next day. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=476.46000000000004s)]
*  When people in America have been devastated by a natural disaster, you need to provide [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=481.02000000000004s)]
*  relief, not play politics. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=487.06s)]
*  These people have lost, in some cases, everything. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=489.70000000000005s)]
*  They've lost their homes, all of their possessions. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=493.02000000000004s)]
*  They're desperately looking for a place to live in a state that has a housing shortage. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=496.66s)]
*  And we're gonna talk about bail reform? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  What the hell does bail reform have to do with this? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=503.82000000000005s)]
*  Politico wrote on the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, federal officials estimated [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=509.90000000000003s)]
*  the taxpayers had eventually laid out some $120 billion to deal with the after effects [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=515.02s)]
*  of the disaster. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=521.46s)]
*  About 76 billion of that sum went to Louisiana projects, nearly three times the size of the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=522.94s)]
*  state's annual budget. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=529.4200000000001s)]
*  That's when Congress wasn't entirely broken. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=532.1400000000001s)]
*  When Congress realized, the whole point of the federal government is to protect the people [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=535.98s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  Otherwise, what the hell is the point? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=544.4200000000001s)]
*  Why the hell are we paying our taxes? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=546.6s)]
*  I'm asking a genuine question here. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=548.7800000000001s)]
*  Why the hell are we paying our taxes if that money doesn't go toward the people of this [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=551.18s)]
*  country? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=558.58s)]
*  Not only to make their lives better, but to rescue them when disaster strikes. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=559.74s)]
*  Are we just paying our taxes to fund the Pentagon? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  Are we just paying our taxes to fund wars abroad? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=568.58s)]
*  I'm being serious. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=573.5s)]
*  What the hell am I paying my taxes for if I can't rely on the federal government to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=575.18s)]
*  help the people of California after they've been victimized by devastating wildfires? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  And again, I wanna reiterate, it is true that our Democratic leaders in this state have [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=583.64s)]
*  let us down, they have failed us. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=589.0s)]
*  So I'm okay with the criticism toward Gavin Newsom or Karen Bass. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=591.64s)]
*  And if anybody has a problem with attacking them or critiquing them because of their failed [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=596.8199999999999s)]
*  leadership because they happen to be Democrats, kick rocks because they did mismanage the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=601.4799999999999s)]
*  lead up to these fires. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=607.04s)]
*  But to punish the people of California, the people of Los Angeles who have lost everything [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=609.28s)]
*  because you don't like the Democratic politicians who lead the state, I think that's ridiculous. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=616.16s)]
*  If you want to provide that aid in a way that ensures the money gets into the hands of the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=620.92s)]
*  actual victims, I'm fine with that. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=625.14s)]
*  Because I don't really trust Gavin Newsom or Karen Bass either. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=627.52s)]
*  But to bring up all these other issues like bail reform and how you don't like that and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=631.48s)]
*  how you might bring that up and use that as something you want changed in order to release [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=636.3399999999999s)]
*  some of the funds for disaster relief, I think that's unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=642.9399999999999s)]
*  There was a brief moment when Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert, by the way, was questioning [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=649.3399999999999s)]
*  whether it was a good idea for American taxpayers to bankroll rebuilding the rebuilding of New [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=654.4399999999999s)]
*  Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=661.66s)]
*  And what happened was really interesting. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=664.0999999999999s)]
*  So that record breaking federal response wasn't assured when failed federally built levees [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=665.72s)]
*  left 80% of New Orleans underwater. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=672.84s)]
*  Hastert, the Republican House Speaker at the time told reporters that it looks like a lot [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=675.36s)]
*  of that place could be bulldozed. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=680.08s)]
*  When asked whether the federal government should spend billions of dollars to rebuild [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=682.6600000000001s)]
*  the city, he said, I don't know. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=685.8000000000001s)]
*  That doesn't make sense to me. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=687.88s)]
*  But he rightly received a lot of backlash from Americans across the country. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  Because guess what? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=696.2199999999999s)]
*  Americans wanted to ensure their fellow Americans in New Orleans were made whole after that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=697.5999999999999s)]
*  devastating hurricane hit, after the devastating floods happened. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  And so as a result, Hastert soon apologized for his remarks. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=707.56s)]
*  He ultimately joined a bipartisan group of congressional leaders along with President [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=710.8399999999999s)]
*  George W Bush in agreeing to support the aid package. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=715.04s)]
*  Now look, again, California lawmakers dropped the ball, I totally agree. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=718.98s)]
*  But we cannot condition the aid based on other non natural disaster issues. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=723.1800000000001s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening here. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=729.48s)]
*  While appearing on Meet the Press last weekend, Speaker Johnson was asked about whether Republicans [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=731.84s)]
*  will use the relief funds to leverage Democrats to get on board with other policies. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=736.4000000000001s)]
*  And here you hear them bring up one other issue. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=742.12s)]
*  Take a look at that. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=745.24s)]
*  I want to tell you something that California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote recently. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=746.72s)]
*  He said, quote, there must be no conditions, no strings attached to disaster aid. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=751.64s)]
*  And yet we know that there's a big conversation happening right now on Capitol Hill about [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=758.12s)]
*  linking disaster aid for California to an increase in the debt limit, which has been [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=762.42s)]
*  a traditionally really thorny issue. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=767.28s)]
*  Are you and can you commit that California disaster relief won't have strings attached? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=770.64s)]
*  No, I won't commit that because we have a serious problem in California. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=776.68s)]
*  I don't think Mike Johnson is really concerned about the poor governance in California. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=781.64s)]
*  I think Mike Johnson sees an opportunity, as do other Republicans in the party, to hold [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=787.12s)]
*  this money hostage, potentially punish Angelino's in order to get some policy wins, including [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=794.28s)]
*  an increase in the debt ceiling. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=804.44s)]
*  So now we've heard about an increase in the debt ceiling, tying the disaster relief funds [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=806.16s)]
*  to that, tying the disaster relief funds to changes in bail reform policy in California. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=810.74s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=817.74s)]
*  And I would caution Republicans who are signing on to this, because if we're gonna set this [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=820.28s)]
*  precedent, I have no doubt in my mind that Democrats will turn around and do the same [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=825.6800000000001s)]
*  thing in Congress. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=830.32s)]
*  And I don't wanna live in that world. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=832.04s)]
*  I wanna live in a world where we actually take care of one another, understand the importance [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=833.72s)]
*  of backing our fellow Americans in their time of tragedy and when they need us the most. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=839.16s)]
*  That's what real leaders and real lawmakers who wanna be public servants would do. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=846.52s)]
*  And again, you wanna trash Newsom and Bass, I don't care, have at it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=852.0s)]
*  But do not add insult to injury and further punish the people of Los Angeles, because [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=857.86s)]
*  you don't like the politicians in this state. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=863.42s)]
*  I think that's unfair and I think that's the wrong thing to do, especially when we're talking [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=866.0799999999999s)]
*  about people who have paid into their taxes and expect the federal government to be there [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=869.8399999999999s)]
*  for them when they need the federal government the most. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKX1J6pyP5M&t=874.2s)]
