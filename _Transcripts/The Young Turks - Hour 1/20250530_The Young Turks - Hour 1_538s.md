"The White House on Thursday said it will fix errors in its ‚ÄúMake America Healthy Again,‚Äù or MAHA, report after a news outlet‚Äôs investigation found that it cited sources that don‚Äôt exist. 
The report, released last week to much fanfare by the administration, cited hundreds of studies to purportedly find the root causes of chronic diseases. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called the report a ‚Äúmilestone‚Äù "

# Scientists EXPOSE RFK Jr.
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0)
*  This morning the White House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=0.0s)]
*  defending Health Secretary Robert [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=1.46s)]
*  F Kennedy juniors make America [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=3.4s)]
*  healthy again report, even as [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=5.04s)]
*  experts raise concerns about [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=6.78s)]
*  his accuracy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=8.28s)]
*  Does the White House have [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  confidence that the information [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=10.56s)]
*  coming from HHS can be trusted? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=12.42s)]
*  Yes, we have complete confidence [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  in Secretary Kennedy and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=15.92s)]
*  his team at HHS. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=17.38s)]
*  Carolyn Levin announcing the White [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  House is fully standing behind HHS [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=21.96s)]
*  and R F K Junior after it was found [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=23.64s)]
*  out that they were citing fictional [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=25.26s)]
*  studies to justify the things they [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=27.0s)]
*  want to do. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=28.7s)]
*  And why would fake studies hurt [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=29.28s)]
*  their confidence? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  They don't care if the studies are [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  true or not that are interested in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=34.04s)]
*  that scientific stuff. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=35.54s)]
*  It's all a means to an end. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=36.44s)]
*  Getting rid of vaccines, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=38.28s)]
*  defunding research, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  firing scientists, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=40.56s)]
*  that's the mission. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=41.64s)]
*  And they do very much have full [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=43.08s)]
*  confidence in that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=44.56s)]
*  Now we're going to get into some [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=46.0s)]
*  of the citations that were wrong [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=47.52s)]
*  and why there's very strong [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  evidence that AI is to blame for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=50.64s)]
*  this, but first a little bit more [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=52.56s)]
*  from the video. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  The section on teen depression [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=55.28s)]
*  rates, a research paper by [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=57.36s)]
*  Dr. Catherine Keys was cited. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=59.2s)]
*  But Dr. Keys says she never wrote [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=61.32s)]
*  that paper. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=63.36s)]
*  The ranges of estimates that were [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=64.28s)]
*  in the statement are not based on [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  my work and work that I know. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  At least two research journals [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=70.56s)]
*  also confirming they are not able [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=72.04s)]
*  to find research cited in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=73.72s)]
*  the government's report. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=75.0s)]
*  The White House dismissing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=76.56s)]
*  the mistakes as formatting issues. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=77.92s)]
*  But it does not negate the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  substance of the report, which as [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=81.72s)]
*  you know is one of the most [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=84.0s)]
*  transformative health reports that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=85.64s)]
*  by the federal government. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  And again, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=89.88s)]
*  there's a grain of truth there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  It is transformative when you take [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  absolute bull crap. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  It's something that's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  going to ruin a country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=96.28s)]
*  That's alchemy at that point. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=97.0s)]
*  Professor McGonigal should be [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  teaching that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=100.83999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, no, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  the substance is actually [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=102.96s)]
*  what's issue. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  It's not formatting. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=105.28s)]
*  It's not that the margins were at [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  the wrong width. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=108.36s)]
*  It's not that one of the images [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=109.6s)]
*  spanned a page break. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=111.24s)]
*  This is not a formatting thing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=112.6s)]
*  This is directly getting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=114.32s)]
*  conclusions of studies wrong or [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  inventing studies that don't [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  actually exist. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=119.36s)]
*  And I don't know how many of these [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=120.52s)]
*  we can cover with the time we have. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=121.84s)]
*  There were four papers cited don't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=123.28s)]
*  exist at all. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=125.28s)]
*  Some of the studies were real, but [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=126.76s)]
*  how they use them was 100% wrong. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=128.76s)]
*  So in one section about mental [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=130.88s)]
*  health medication, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=132.36s)]
*  the report cites a review paper. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=133.4s)]
*  It claims shows that therapy alone [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=135.24s)]
*  is as or more effective than [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=137.28s)]
*  psychiatric medicine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=138.88s)]
*  But one of that paper statisticians [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=140.6s)]
*  said that that conclusion doesn't [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=142.0s)]
*  make sense, given their study [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=143.28s)]
*  didn't even attempt to measure or [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=144.44s)]
*  compare therapy's effectiveness as [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=146.0s)]
*  a mental health treatment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  And that combined with a few other [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=149.52s)]
*  specific things have led some [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=151.16s)]
*  people to believe that they just [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=152.68s)]
*  used AI to generate this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=154.24s)]
*  AI hallucinated as it always does [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  and it takes bits and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  pieces of things that actually [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=158.68s)]
*  exist, but it's not a human. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't understand what's going [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  on. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=163.16s)]
*  And I mostly find that to be [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=163.66s)]
*  convincing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=164.88s)]
*  The only thing that makes me [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=165.84s)]
*  question whether it was AI is it is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=167.08s)]
*  possible that RFK Junior did as he [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=168.72s)]
*  likes to do, do his own research. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  And I'm sure he's as utterly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=173.4s)]
*  incapable of understanding [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=174.76s)]
*  scientific research as chat GPT. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=176.22s)]
*  So it's possible that it's just him [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=178.0s)]
*  doing what he's going to do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  But remember, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=181.76s)]
*  they're moving ahead. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  They're not like pulling back on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=184.16s)]
*  this and we're already seeing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  the ripple effects of this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  They've changed the government's [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  advice on COVID vaccination. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  They pulled a nearly billion [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  dollar Moderna contract that they [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=193.12s)]

*  the bird flu. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=199.56s)]
*  They're just done with it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=200.64s)]
*  And it's explicitly based on [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=201.84s)]
*  the sort of COVID vaccine [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=203.52s)]
*  conspiracy theorizing that they've [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=205.12s)]
*  done. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=207.16s)]

*  So the doctors are saying one [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=225.8s)]

*  right? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=245.28s)]

*  as John said, medicine that they [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=269.88s)]

*  That wasn't really true. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=273.24s)]

*  that is with citations that are [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=276.16s)]

*  The nice thing about the Internet [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=280.64s)]

*  Professor McGonigal was while John [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  was doing his presentation. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=285.6s)]
*  And I found that it was [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  a Harry Potter character. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=288.48s)]
*  And he teaches- [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  Transfiguration. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  He teaches Transfiguration, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=292.84s)]
*  exactly. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=294.44s)]
*  And so, but really, that's what [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  we're dealing with here. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  And so how can you stick by [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=298.52s)]
*  a medical report from AI? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=299.96s)]
*  Even if it was a mistake, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=301.44s)]
*  they should say we made a mistake. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=302.88s)]
*  We'll issue another report that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=305.08s)]
*  will be largely like this with [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=306.44s)]
*  different citations. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  But you can't stick by a report [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=308.88s)]
*  that is citing science that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=310.52s)]
*  doesn't exist, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=312.12s)]
*  not even refuting science. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=313.2s)]
*  Yeah, this is the M.O. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=316.4s)]
*  Or the Trump administration. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=317.55999999999995s)]
*  Always double down, never backtrack, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  never say, yo, we made a mistake. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=322.6s)]
*  This is easily fixable, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=324.8s)]
*  simple mistake, move on. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=326.68s)]
*  Hand up, my bad, no, never. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=328.72s)]
*  That's just not the way of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=330.76s)]
*  this administration. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=332.72s)]
*  And yeah, Robert F. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=333.76s)]
*  Kennedy, as Mike said, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=334.68s)]

*  There's just no two ways about it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=336.96s)]
*  I think there's obviously something [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=340.44s)]
*  to the idea that the big food [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=342.92s)]

*  We're ingesting stuff that other [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=357.12s)]

*  And yeah, man, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  we'll see how long this lasts. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=374.36s)]
*  I don't think he's going to be in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  there for four years. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=377.52s)]

*  And to what was saying, John, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=380.6s)]
*  quickly is also when you defund [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=382.36s)]
*  the EPA and the FDA and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=384.36s)]
*  the way this administration has, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=385.64s)]
*  you don't address any of that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=387.76s)]
*  either. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=389.44s)]
*  So it's not just Kennedy and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=390.12s)]
*  his department, which has also been [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=391.76s)]

*  cuts, those ridiculous doge cuts. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=396.0s)]
*  So it's all tied together. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=398.24s)]
*  So you're not going to get anybody [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=400.72s)]
*  addressing the real problems that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=402.24s)]

*  I mean, even if RFK Jr. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  was honest or competent, even if he [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=420.08s)]

*  it doesn't matter because [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=424.28s)]
*  the administration is interested [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  in this, the movement fundamentally [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=427.12s)]
*  is not passionate about getting [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=428.88s)]
*  healthier. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=430.44s)]
*  We just had that big, mostly [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=431.28s)]
*  fictional fight about Democrats [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=433.23999999999995s)]
*  trying to take away their natural [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=435.59999999999997s)]

*  How dare you? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=438.96s)]
*  I don't care about the asthma, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=439.76s)]
*  I like the way it feels. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=441.24s)]

*  about becoming healthier. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=444.8s)]
*  And then you look at what's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=446.59999999999997s)]
*  actually in here, and I agree with [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=448.2s)]
*  was by the way, I do think the food [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=450.28s)]
*  industry and pharmaceutical [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvBnsNjPwj0&t=452.28s)]
