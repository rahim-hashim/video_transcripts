# Bernie Goes NUCLEAR
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q)
*  Explain, a few hundred of the wealthiest families in this country, $235 billion tax break. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Most small businesses, they are- [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=9.06s)]
*  Has zero to do with, come on, you're smarter than that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=11.06s)]
*  This is the top two tenths of 1%, this is not a mom and pop store. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=14.14s)]
*  Yesterday Senator Bernie Sanders lost his patience with Treasury Secretary Scott Bissett [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=21.34s)]
*  during a Senate Finance Committee hearing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=26.46s)]
*  The two of them were debating the quote unquote, big beautiful bill and Bernie got sick of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=29.34s)]
*  Bissett's excuses for handing massive tax cuts to the rich. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=34.74s)]
*  So we have more on this very fiery Bernie clip. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=39.1s)]
*  But before we get into that, Cenk, what are your thoughts here? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=43.82s)]
*  I mean, Bernie is always gonna be the man of the people, but Bissett, his responses [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=46.66s)]
*  to this get a little cagey. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=51.54s)]
*  For sure. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  So two quick things here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  First of all, Bernie's right, small businesses. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=56.98s)]
*  The state tax applies for people with estates over $10 million, okay? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=59.779999999999994s)]
*  There are no small businesses there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=64.5s)]
*  And $235 billion is just for the estate tax tax cut. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=67.38s)]
*  That goes to super, super rich people, right? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=73.66s)]
*  And so the rest of it, I'm going to explain after you guys see the fight between the Treasury [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=76.97999999999999s)]
*  Secretary and Bernie. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=81.8s)]
*  Because on top of that is a hell of a lot more tax cuts for the rich. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=84.08s)]
*  All right, so with that, here is the exchange between Bernie and Bissett. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=88.08s)]
*  And this is how it started. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  Help me out here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=96.28s)]
*  My understanding is the Trump administration has, I think, 13 billionaires in office right [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=97.44s)]
*  now leading government agencies. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=103.92s)]
*  Is that about right, do you think? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  I have no idea, Senator. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=107.2s)]
*  I think that's what the number is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=108.84s)]
*  Do you think it's a coincidence, given the large number of billionaires in the Trump [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=110.56s)]
*  administration, that this particular piece of legislation would provide $235 billion [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  in tax breaks to the top two-tenths of 1% by expanding the exemptions in the estate tax? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  Senator, I will tell you that when the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act passed, my tax rate went [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  up. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=137.44s)]
*  All right, well after that, Bernie got really heated. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=140.8s)]
*  And Bissett's counterargument was to bring up how the Democrats didn't pass a wealth [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  tax when they were in charge. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=148.44s)]
*  Here's that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=150.44s)]
*  Why do you think at a time of unprecedented income and wealth inequality, when people [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=152.36s)]
*  like yourself economically have never ever had it so good, why do you think it's a good [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=158.96s)]
*  idea to cut Medicaid for low-income and working-class people by $700 billion to give $200 billion [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=163.62s)]
*  and $35 billion in tax breaks to the very, very, very richest people in this country, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=170.36s)]
*  perhaps a few hundred families? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  Please justify that and tell me about that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, Senator, I don't know, but the Democrats had the trifecta and there was no tax increase [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  or wealth tax on billionaires. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  You chose not to do that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=187.4s)]
*  I'm not talking about a tax. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=188.4s)]
*  You chose not to do that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=189.4s)]
*  Mr. Bessett and I, I'm not talking about a wealth tax. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=190.4s)]
*  a few hundred of the wealthiest families in this country, $235 billion tax break. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=193.76s)]
*  Erroneous, Bessett. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=203.0s)]
*  Okay, so next, Bessett pretended that the tax cuts were really for small businesses, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  which is an unbelievable claim. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=210.88s)]
*  Bernie instantly shot that down. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's watch him do it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=214.72s)]
*  I think that this will increase small businesses substantially. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=216.72s)]
*  That most small businesses, they are- [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=223.16s)]
*  Has zero to do with, come on, you're smarter than that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=225.88s)]
*  This is the top two-tenths of 1%. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=228.8s)]
*  This is not a mom and pop store. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=231.36s)]
*  These are multi-billionaires and the savings go to their kids after they pass away. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=233.04s)]
*  This is nothing more than a gift to billionaires in this country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=238.2s)]
*  Well, sir, that's just not correct because the top 10% paid a bigger share of taxes [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=243.04s)]
*  after TCB. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=249.28s)]
*  I'm talking about one provision in this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=250.28s)]
*  I don't want to argue with you about taxes in general. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  One provision, few hundred families, $235 billion in tax breaks. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=254.6s)]
*  You can't justify that because morally it is totally unjustifiable. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=259.44s)]
*  So they're trying to argue numbers. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=266.12s)]
*  Well, we got numbers. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=267.32s)]
*  So yesterday the Congressional Budget Office released an analysis of the Big Beautiful [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=268.44s)]
*  Bill that stated the bottom 10% would overall lose government benefits worth an average [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=272.8s)]
*  of $15.59 or 3.9% of their current income each year over the next decade. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=278.6s)]
*  The bottom 30% of Americans would all on average lose more benefits than they would receive [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=285.8s)]
*  from the bill. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=291.0s)]
*  In contrast, the top 10% would gain an average of $12,000.44, a 2.3% annual increase to their [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=292.16s)]
*  current income. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=300.6s)]
*  Middle class Americans would see smaller gains. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  The middle 10% of Americans would on average net $514 per year if the measure were enacted, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=304.24s)]
*  an annual increase of 0.5% in their current income. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=312.22s)]
*  And then the New York Times took the CBO's data and turned it into this very handy chart. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=316.92s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=322.44s)]
*  You can see here how the BBB would affect households at different incomes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=324.0s)]
*  The chart visualizes the estimated annual average change in resources over the next [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=328.56s)]
*  decade or so. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=333.86s)]
*  As you can see, the bill would give wealthy Americans the largest benefits while taking [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=335.32s)]
*  away the most from the poorest Americans. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=339.6s)]
*  It's also worth noting that the cuts to SNAP and healthcare are roughly equivalent to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=343.32s)]
*  the tax cuts for the rich, as you can see here. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=348.12s)]
*  This chart shows how they come out to about the same number, $1.1 trillion. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=350.82s)]
*  So it gets worse. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=359.88s)]
*  According to the New York Times, some of the tax cuts for working Americans, such as no [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=360.88s)]
*  tax on tips, are only set to last a few years. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=365.52s)]
*  So those get sunsetted very quickly. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=369.46s)]
*  But the tax cuts for the rich would be made permanent. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=372.44s)]
*  Who knew? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=376.08s)]
*  Who could have expected this? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=377.08s)]
*  And now we have Scott Bissett there who's trying to defend this bill, trying to act [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=379.12s)]
*  like this is a good thing for the American people, even to the point where he's saying, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=383.44s)]
*  I'm the one who's not gonna benefit from this. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=387.64s)]
*  My taxes are gonna go up with all this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=390.02s)]
*  And then he tries to make it about small businesses, which is very, it just particularly egregious [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=392.56s)]
*  to me. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=397.88s)]
*  Because all we're seeing these days is monopolies becoming bigger and bigger monopolies, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=399.42s)]
*  And we're seeing that the government is not doing anything to stop these monopolies from [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=404.66s)]
*  happening. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=408.98s)]
*  They're not enforcing any kind of antitrust laws. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=409.98s)]
*  And over time, what's happening is it just gets worse and worse for the American consumer, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  for lower and middle class Americans. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=417.3s)]
*  Because we have fewer and fewer choices as to where we wanna spend our money and our [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=419.42s)]
*  time. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=423.86s)]
*  We're getting advertised to by these companies who don't have our best interests in heart. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=424.86s)]
*  They're only serving the bottom line. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=428.68s)]
*  And granted, they're businesses, so that is their MO, right? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=431.52s)]
*  That's what they're supposed to do. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  But I think I'm just particularly prickly about this right now because you guys, I sew. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=436.64s)]
*  And I've been following this whole story with the fall of Joanne's fabrics and how Michael's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=443.72s)]
*  now is taking all of their stuff. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=448.48s)]
*  And the idea that small business is meant to proliferate in this kind of economy and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=451.56s)]
*  this kind of environment is ridiculous. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=456.84s)]
*  It's not gonna happen. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=458.92s)]
*  Yeah, so he did two things there. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=459.92s)]
*  One was misdirect. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=462.21999999999997s)]
*  So Bernie would ask him about the estate tax and he'd say, well, the tax on the top 10%, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=464.08s)]
*  we weren't talking about that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=469.62s)]
*  We were talking about the estate tax. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=471.74s)]
*  So the second thing he would do is the what aboutism. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=474.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, when you guys were in charge, you didn't increase tax on the rich. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=476.5s)]
*  That's true, actually. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=480.02s)]
*  You've seen us criticize that a lot on the young Turks, but not relevant here. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=481.62s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=487.02s)]
*  Right, you're giving a much, much, much larger giveaway to the rich. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=488.3s)]
*  In fact, the Democrats didn't bring back a lot of the corporate taxes to the rate that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=492.82s)]
*  they were or bring back the tax cuts that Trump put into place. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=498.3s)]
*  But they didn't add additional tax cuts. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  The Republicans are the ones that always do the tax cuts for the rich. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=506.65999999999997s)]
*  And especially the estate tax, right? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  Because that's the richest of the rich. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=512.5s)]
*  And so that is the number one constituency for the Republican Party historically in my [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=514.46s)]
*  lifetime. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=518.86s)]
*  And if you don't know that, you just don't know politics. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=519.86s)]
*  So now the two charts we showed you there I think are so telling. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=522.12s)]
*  The first one where you see how the bottom 10% and the bottom 30% overall are losing [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=527.3s)]
*  money and the people at the highest end are gaining the most money. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=532.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, if this isn't a chart that shows you the core of the Republican Party, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=537.3s)]
*  I don't know what is. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=542.2199999999999s)]
*  Take from the poor and give to the rich. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=543.5799999999999s)]
*  Republican 101, okay? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=546.3s)]
*  And so yeah, go ahead, Michael, and then come back. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=551.02s)]
*  Yeah, and if we can keep that chart up there for one more second, if we can bring that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=552.9399999999999s)]
*  up possibly. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=556.3399999999999s)]
*  So 3.9% in the bottom 10%, the impact of that amount to what they have versus the 2.3% [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=557.9s)]
*  in the top 10%. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=567.3000000000001s)]
*  You're talking about an uncanny amount of money that the top 10%, that the 2.3% of their [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=569.14s)]
*  money is, or 2.3% increases for them. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=575.94s)]
*  As opposed to the devastation that 4% can do to the people that are in the bottom 10%. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=579.46s)]
*  So it's not just about the percentages, it's about the actual, the impact of those dollars [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=584.46s)]
*  and how many they are. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=591.52s)]
*  So it's important to think of that, not just the percentages here. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=592.58s)]
*  100%, Michael, so that's actually one of the three things I wanted to get to here. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=596.94s)]
*  So they take $1,500 on average, which is absolutely backbreaking from the bottom 10%, and they [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=602.14s)]
*  give over $12,000 to the top 10%. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=610.74s)]
*  And then when you get into the top 1%, top 0.1%, the numbers are comical and tragic. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=614.58s)]
*  I mean, we're giving them an unbelievable tax cut that they don't need. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=620.78s)]
*  And we're literally taking it from the poorest Americans to do it, which then brings me to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=625.46s)]
*  the second chart that we showed you guys. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=629.3s)]
*  And that's actually conservative. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=632.9399999999999s)]
*  I've seen an estimate that people making about $500,000 are going to actually get a $1.7 [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=634.58s)]
*  trillion tax cut. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=641.14s)]
*  But okay, let's stick with the conservative numbers at 1.1. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=642.98s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=645.3s)]
*  They are literally taking from Medicaid and STAP, the people who need food and healthcare, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=646.74s)]
*  and transferring it over to people making over $500,000 a year. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=653.94s)]
*  Bernie had a line in that back and forth with the Treasury Secretary, where he explained [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=660.46s)]
*  that if you take healthcare away from 15 million people, which is one outcome of this bill, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=665.34s)]
*  10 million for sure from those specific Medicaid cuts and another 5 million from how it affects [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=672.0999999999999s)]
*  Obamacare, right? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=678.4599999999999s)]
*  If you do that, estimates for Meal and Penn are that 50,000 Americans will die because [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=680.38s)]
*  they don't have health insurance, because it got taken away there. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=688.78s)]
*  So on top of taking it from the poor to give to the rich, we're going to let 50,000 Americans [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=692.2199999999999s)]
*  die so that people above $500,000 could get over a trillion dollars in tax cuts. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=698.1800000000001s)]
*  And now for the final piece of chicanery here, how are they tricking you? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=705.82s)]
*  Trump's like, I'm a populist man, I'm going to give tax cuts on tips. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=710.66s)]
*  And so a lot of people, whenever I talk about how it's to give away to the rich online, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=717.78s)]
*  no way, man. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=721.1800000000001s)]
*  They're going to take away taxes on tips, that's for the average guy. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=722.1800000000001s)]
*  In the bill, tax cuts for the rich are permanent, tax cuts on tips are only for a couple of [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=727.14s)]
*  years. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=733.74s)]
*  It's just window dressing, it's marketing to get you to believe that it's for the average [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=734.74s)]
*  man when it's actually generally speaking, robbing from the average man and giving it [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=738.78s)]
*  to the rich. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=743.82s)]
*  Not to mention the people that won't be able to afford to go out and leave you a tip because [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=746.26s)]
*  of what this does to their household income. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=749.98s)]
*  Let's not forget that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=752.58s)]
*  So the interesting thing the Treasury Secretary said to Senator Sanders, he said my tax rate [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=753.7s)]
*  went up in 2017, which like you said, Cenk, matters not at all to the conversation they're [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=759.4200000000001s)]
*  having. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=763.94s)]
*  Because this is talking about when the Treasury Secretary is dead. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=765.34s)]
*  This has nothing to do with what happened to his tax rate in 2017. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=768.84s)]
*  This isn't what Senator Sanders was saying was this is about simply the estate tax. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=772.74s)]
*  And again, you saw the Treasury Secretary Scott Pesant say to the Senator, he said [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=778.3s)]
*  that this is good for small businesses, which he was cut off them by Senator Sanders. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=788.2199999999999s)]
*  And then it makes you think of what they're looking for there. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=794.06s)]
*  Cuz what he was going to continue saying, even though I don't have his script, he was [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=797.66s)]
*  gonna say that because of these cuts, small businesses are gonna be able to thrive because [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=801.5s)]
*  it's gonna be more discretionary spending for people who spend without discretion. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=806.26s)]
*  And the point there is that trickle down economics has never, ever, ever, ever worked in the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=812.1s)]
*  United States. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=817.9s)]
*  It has never worked in our short history. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=818.9s)]
*  The army is 250, we're 249. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=820.5400000000001s)]
*  It's never worked and that's what they keep falling back on and keep relying on. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=823.82s)]
*  And then the trickle down continues after they're dead. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=828.0s)]
*  Cuz they're saying they want everything they leave behind to trickle down to the people [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=831.98s)]
*  that they're leaving behind, their descendants, thank you. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=838.3000000000001s)]
*  So they want it all to go to their descendants. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=842.14s)]
*  They want all of this to go to their descendants, which is again, consistent in trickle down. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=844.28s)]
*  And that's where Senator Sanders is saying, no, no, that's not what we want in this country. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=848.94s)]
*  And it's 200 families and it's 230, what's the number, 235 billion? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=854.22s)]
*  Yeah, so it's just absurd. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=858.66s)]
*  It's a philosophy that you can't shake from these people. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=860.92s)]
*  And that is why, again, having these committee hearings and getting people to understand [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=864.0s)]
*  this is super important. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=868.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I can't believe it when I heard this and talking. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=869.8399999999999s)]
*  I can't believe that trickle down is again just being repackaged and redelivered to the [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=873.16s)]
*  American people as if we haven't heard this a million times before for the past several [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=878.12s)]
*  decades. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  Republicans are just doing the absolute most to justify these tax cuts, even though they [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=884.3199999999999s)]
*  know that people are literally going to die because of them. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  Many of them, by the way, Republican voters. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=892.1999999999999s)]
*  And they have to know that this isn't gonna go over well for their base. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=894.52s)]
*  They can't justify it because there is no justification for what they're doing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=898.4799999999999s)]
*  But Trump, he obviously doesn't care about the future of the Republican Party. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  He talks about a third term, but I think he knows that he doesn't have a third term in [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=906.26s)]
*  him. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=909.76s)]
*  But Republicans who back this bill, what is their plan? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=910.76s)]
*  How are they planning to win their own reelection campaigns after all this is over? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=913.76s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=918.62s)]
*  So Cenk, what do you think? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=919.62s)]
*  Move on to the next story? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=920.62s)]
*  Yeah, no, real quick, last couple of things here. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=921.62s)]
*  Of course. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=924.42s)]
*  So look, the bill is very unpopular, so that's good news. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=926.26s)]
*  But it'll pass anyway, doesn't matter. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=930.82s)]
*  All these giant tax cuts for the rich are unpopular, they pass. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=932.62s)]
*  But I want you guys to understand the 235 billion is on top of the 1.1 trillion. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=936.34s)]
*  So it just keeps, there's just different layers of giveaways for the rich in this bill. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=943.0s)]
*  And then finally, the middle of the percentiles that we talked about there, the very middle [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=947.34s)]
*  class, it's a 0.5% bump from the bill, right? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=953.38s)]
*  But the rich get 2.3%, the top 10%. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=957.7s)]
*  So even when you hear them say, this is for the middle class, middle class. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=961.02s)]
*  Remember, no, the top 10% get about five times more than the middle class. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=965.82s)]
*  And that's before you take into account the state tax and all the other giveaways for [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=971.98s)]
*  the rich. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=975.82s)]
*  So you shouldn't get any more, you shouldn't get one more. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=976.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hWpQED20Q&t=979.86s)]
