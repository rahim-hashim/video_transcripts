TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Canada's SPICY Response To Trump's Tariffs
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4)
*  There are no winners in a trade war. Canadians are reasonable and we are polite. But we will [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=0.0s)]
*  not back down from a fight. Not when our country and the well-being of everyone in it is at [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=7.68s)]
*  stake to the American people. We don't want this. We want to work with you as a friend [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  and ally. And we don't want to see you hurt either. But your government has chosen to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=24.759999999999998s)]
*  do this to you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=32.64s)]
*  As of this morning, markets are down and inflation is set to rise dramatically all across your [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=36.94s)]
*  country. Now it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal. But Donald, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=43.28s)]
*  they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=49.4s)]
*  President Donald Trump's tariffs on exports coming from Canada, Mexico and China have [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=58.16s)]
*  officially gone into effect. These are 25% tariffs that impact imports coming from Mexico [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=64.48s)]
*  and Canada. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=69.96s)]
*  And in addition to that, of course, Trump implemented another 10% tariff on top of the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=71.32s)]
*  already implemented 10% tariff on Chinese goods. And now they are retaliating with tariffs [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=77.36s)]
*  of their own. But before we get into those details and any harm it might cause to American [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=83.08s)]
*  consumers, here's what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada explained in regard to his [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=88.4s)]
*  efforts in thwarting this tariff and trade war. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=95.88s)]
*  Because if you can recall, Trump had threatened Canada with 25% tariffs a month ago. Trump [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=100.28s)]
*  got some concessions from Canada in order to prevent the tariffs. Apparently that didn't [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=106.12s)]
*  work out and Trudeau doesn't understand why. Take a look. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  A month ago, as part of an agreement with the United States that paused the tariffs, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=116.08s)]
*  we made further commitments. We appointed Kevin Brousseau as our Fentanyl Czar, a man [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=121.48s)]
*  who dedicated his multi-decade career in law enforcement to combating organized crime networks [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=128.72s)]
*  and drug trafficking. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=135.16s)]
*  We designated seven drug cartels, sick evil groups who cynically profit off the pain and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=137.24s)]
*  suffering of people on both sides of the border as the terrorist organizations that they are. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=144.0s)]
*  And just yesterday, we launched a new joint operations partnership supported by a $200 [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=151.44s)]
*  million investment between Canada's security and law enforcement agencies. A partnership [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=158.48s)]
*  that will enhance the coordination of information and intelligence in order to thwart criminal [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=165.28s)]
*  gangs involved in the illegal fentanyl trade. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=170.48s)]
*  As the US Customs and Border Protection just acknowledged, there was a 97% drop in fentanyl [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=174.28s)]
*  seizures from January compared to December to a near zero low of less than half an ounce [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=181.76s)]
*  seized in January. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=192.0s)]
*  I mean, doesn't necessarily mean your efforts worked. I mean, maybe you just failed in seizing [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=195.48s)]
*  the fence. I'm just kidding. No. So look, what he's trying to do here is make clear, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=201.28s)]
*  look, Trump, we kept our side of the deal. You say that these tariffs are all about using [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=206.44000000000003s)]
*  your leverage to get us to do something about the flow of drugs into your country. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=213.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, I've done something about that. I've even called the cartels terrorists. Why aren't [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  you keeping up with your side of the deal? Why are you implementing or imposing 25% tariffs [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  on Canadian goods coming into the United States? And so before I get to his statements about [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=230.28000000000003s)]
*  what Canada is doing to the United States in response, Cenk, what are your thoughts [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=235.7s)]
*  so far? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=240.34s)]
*  Yeah, so I want to tell folks in a minute why we're doing this because Trudeau's right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=241.34s)]
*  It's totally nonsensical. And in fact, we gave Trump credit for pressuring Canada and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=246.42s)]
*  Mexico to do something about fentanyl in his first, what we thought was a bluff on the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=254.46s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=259.42s)]
*  And it kind of worked. And since we're the fairest show in America, we're like, hey, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=260.62s)]
*  look, they're doing something about fentanyl. And then he imposed the tariffs anyway. So [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=264.38s)]
*  I think that there's a reason why. But I also want to give voice to our audience. America [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=268.73999999999995s)]
*  needs a reboot is very upset with Trudeau, saying Trudeau's a huge liar. He said Trump's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=272.21999999999997s)]
*  a smart guy. Hey, I'm just here to share what the American people are saying, that's all. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=279.58s)]
*  All right, well, now I want to go to Trudeau's statements in regard to what type of tariffs [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=285.58s)]
*  are now going to be implemented against US imports into Canada. Take a look. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=292.3s)]
*  At the moment, the US tariffs came into effect in the early hours of this morning. And so [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=298.3s)]
*  did the Canadian response. Canada will be implementing 25% tariffs against $155 billion [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=306.3s)]
*  worth of American goods. Starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=313.3s)]
*  and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion of American products in 21 days time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=323.58s)]
*  Should these tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=330.58000000000004s)]
*  and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures. Measures which will demonstrate [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=335.92s)]
*  that there are no winners in a trade war. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=343.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump was not pleased and put out a statement on social media that honestly led to more [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=349.06s)]
*  questions, at least more questions for me. Because he says, please explain to Governor [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=355.1s)]
*  Trudeau of Canada, essentially referencing the annexation of Canada that he keeps threatening [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=360.18s)]
*  with. That when he puts on a retaliatory tariff on the US, our reciprocal tariff will immediately [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  increase by a like amount. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=373.46s)]
*  So does that mean we're now going to impose 50% tariffs on Canadian goods coming into [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  the United States? I don't know. I don't know. There's been no clarity on that so far. But [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=381.3s)]
*  that's where we stand right now with Canada. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=387.82s)]
*  So again, I'm going to go to one of the viewers. This time it's a YouTube member. I hate to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=390.78s)]
*  join one below to be part of the show. Jonathan Bors, Johnny wrote in, Trudeau and Trump are [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=394.3s)]
*  unpopular in Canada. Standing up to Trump might actually give him a big lift in popularity [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  already has started. And the reason I'm reading that, he, Jonathan took the words right out [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=404.7s)]
*  of my mouth. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=408.46s)]
*  I thought, if this keeps going, Trudeau might stay, right? Because he was leaving because [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=409.46s)]
*  he was so unpopular. But Trump is accidentally making him popular. And there's a layup for [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=414.34s)]
*  Trudeau because a lot of people are nervous like Zelensky and others. Yeah, but if I hoked [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=419.7s)]
*  a bear, as justifiable as it is and as frustrating as it is to deal with Trump, there might be [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=425.14s)]
*  consequences. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=430.9s)]
*  And I'm not sure I want to deal with the consequences. But what Trump has done here is said to Canada, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=431.9s)]
*  I don't care what you do. I'm going to give you this 25% tariff anyway. You did exactly [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=437.06s)]
*  what I asked you to do. Now less than 1% of the Pental in the country comes in from Canada. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=442.86s)]
*  So what else is there left to do? So the Canadians are logically going, well, then, F you too. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=449.26s)]
*  And so since there's nothing we could do to avoid it, then we're going to fight back. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=455.26s)]
*  Because there's nowhere left to go. And so now he's forcing them into a corner that they're [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=460.22s)]
*  trying to fight out of. Of course, they're going to do tariffs. And then Trump is now [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  saying, yeah, I'm going to do double the tariffs or whatever the hell he's saying with that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=469.54s)]
*  reciprocal comment. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, if that's true, then they're going to double their tariffs. And that is how trade [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=473.02000000000004s)]
*  wars get totally and utterly out of control. So there's now tons of people in the car industry [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=477.14000000000004s)]
*  going, what are we doing? What are we doing? One executive said that the cars might now [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=484.26000000000005s)]
*  be on average $20,000 more. How is this fighting inflation? So look, it's one thing when you're [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=490.82000000000005s)]
*  trying to get something specific. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=497.92s)]
*  And also, or trying to get reciprocal tariffs in the first place. But it's another thing [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=501.46000000000004s)]
*  to do what Trump is doing here. I'm not trying to get anything out of Canada. I already got [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  what I wanted. And it's not reciprocal. I'm putting a massive tariff on you that you didn't [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=510.62s)]
*  have on me. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=516.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=517.3s)]
*  That makes no sense at all. And that's why the stock market is crashing. And I don't [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=518.3s)]
*  know how much Trump can withstand the stock market going down this much. So his bluffs [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=523.02s)]
*  are being called in real time now. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=528.54s)]
*  I gotta say though, Trump is unwittingly helping the radlibs who hate cars and want everyone [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=530.7s)]
*  to take public transportation. Even in cities where public transportation isn't really efficient [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=538.78s)]
*  and isn't even available in large parts of the city. So I guess, congratulations, car-hating [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=544.5s)]
*  radlibs. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=551.98s)]
*  I don't know. We'll see. We'll see how this plays out. But let's go to Mexico now. Because [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=552.98s)]
*  Gloria Scheinbaum, the president of Mexico, has stated that there will be retaliation. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=558.98s)]
*  Although we don't know what that retaliation is gonna look like quite yet. Apparently, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=563.74s)]
*  she is meeting with officials in her government and they're coming up with a plan that will [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=568.14s)]
*  be announced during the weekend, I believe on Sunday. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=573.28s)]
*  But China also was hit with additional 10% tariffs. And that, again, is in addition to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=577.78s)]
*  the 10% tariffs that Trump had imposed last month. And so China has decided to impose [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=586.3s)]
*  additional tariffs on US goods entering their country. Namely, 15% tariffs on US chicken, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=592.86s)]
*  wheat, corn, and cotton products. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=599.54s)]
*  10% tariffs on American soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits and veggies, and dairy products [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=602.14s)]
*  as well. And so this is going to certainly cause some harm to American farmers. So there's [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=609.46s)]
*  a lot of concern about how they will be made whole, if made whole at all. During the previous [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=616.02s)]
*  Trump term, he used the revenue that the United States had collected from Chinese tariffs [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=623.4200000000001s)]
*  or tariffs on Chinese goods to subsidize American farmers. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=629.5s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether that would be the case this time around. In addition, though, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=634.0600000000001s)]
*  China's Commerce Ministry added more than two dozen American companies to their export [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=638.58s)]
*  control and corporate blacklists. The ministry added 15 American companies to an export control [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=644.4599999999999s)]
*  list, including Silicon Valley drone maker Skydio, as well as Andreessen Horowitz-backed [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=651.4599999999999s)]
*  artificial intelligence startup Shield AI, which makes AI-powered systems for drones. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=659.0999999999999s)]
*  Sorry Andreessen, I'm sure that hurts. Now there's a total of 25 American companies added [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=665.02s)]
*  to China's export control list when you consider the previous companies that they had placed [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=670.66s)]
*  on such list. But 14 of the 25 American firms added to the export control and entity lists [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=675.3s)]
*  on Tuesday were already sanctioned by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs last year. A move [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=682.66s)]
*  the ministry said was linked to the US agreeing to sell arms to Taiwan. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=689.0600000000001s)]
*  Now I give you that detail because it's important to note that China's really retaliating in [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=694.42s)]
*  a very calculated and measured way, right? So they're listing these US companies that [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=699.74s)]
*  they're kind of blacklisting. But at the same time, they'd already blacklisted a lot of [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=704.98s)]
*  these companies, right? For other reasons, having to do with the US government supplying [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=709.7s)]
*  Taiwan with some weapons. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=714.32s)]
*  Now China also opened an investigation into the sale of certain optical fiber products [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=716.8s)]
*  by US manufacturers. And China says that it has also filed a lawsuit with the World Trade [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=722.7s)]
*  Organization against the United States over these new tariffs. Analysts argue again that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=729.7s)]
*  this is actually a super measured response from China because the tariffs will not impact [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=736.22s)]
*  all American imports across the board. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=740.62s)]
*  But this news will hurt American farmers again. So China was the United States third largest [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=744.38s)]
*  destination for agricultural exports last year, totaling about $24.7 billion in value, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=750.26s)]
*  according to the US Department of Agriculture data. It is by far the US's largest buyer [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=757.66s)]
*  of soybeans, purchasing about $12.8 billion in 2024, according to the USDA. So that's [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=762.86s)]
*  where we stand right now. Things are definitely interesting. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=770.8s)]
*  I think these countries are just curious, what do you want from us, Trump? Communicate [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=775.8199999999999s)]
*  to us what you would like in exchange so we don't have to engage in a trade war. And that's [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=781.26s)]
*  really unclear, right? I mean, they made concessions to Trump when it came to fentanyl. Apparently [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=787.4s)]
*  Trump is dissatisfied, but he's not really giving us any specificity as to why he's dissatisfied. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=793.28s)]
*  Yeah, I want to get to why they're actually doing this in one sec. Members and viewers [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=799.28s)]
*  tonight are on fire. Michael Catalano on Super Chat said, if Canada wants to win this trade [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=804.76s)]
*  war, they should refuse to sell any lithium to Tesla. That would change Elon's tune real [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=809.76s)]
*  quick. I love that as an idea, just to experiment. If you said, if Canada said that, I'd be super [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=814.52s)]
*  curious if the tariffs got pulled in a couple of days or a week, right? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=822.76s)]
*  I like that idea a lot. Anyways, now somebody pointed out John's theory for why this is [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=828.4s)]
*  happening. John Iderloh, of course, is the host of Damage Report. Check that out on [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=835.5600000000001s)]
*  YouTube as well or on tyt.com. DragonDragon said, I'm with Johnny Pye. It's all stock [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=841.48s)]
*  market fix. So that's a fun theory. The folks that are wheeling and dealing in the stock [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=845.96s)]
*  market at the highest levels, they have the stock market drop, then they buy and it goes [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=851.72s)]
*  back up or they buy on the way down and buy on the way up. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=855.98s)]
*  And there is a way to do that. Maybe, but I think what's more likely is, if he did it [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=860.04s)]
*  with just China and he did reciprocal tariffs, as we've said now many times, that would make [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=867.12s)]
*  sense. But he's dragging Canada into this, Mexico into this in a way that is so gratuitous, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=871.92s)]
*  especially after Canada gave them everything they want. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=878.04s)]
*  Okay, so why? This is all as a lead up to the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, because they [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=880.4s)]
*  know that that's going to be a super hard pill to swallow, even for MAGA. Like, wait, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=888.0s)]
*  why are we giving $4.5 trillion to the richest people in the country, to the corporations [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=893.8s)]
*  and their executives? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=902.0s)]
*  Well, that's when Trump's going to say, my God, look at all the cuts that Doge made. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=903.4s)]
*  We cut a bunch of condoms in Gaza or Africa. And the tariffs, the tariffs are going to [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=907.76s)]
*  magically create trillions of dollars and gold cards. Gold cards are also going to magically [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=912.7199999999999s)]
*  create trillions of dollars. He's got to get you to believe that trillions of dollars are [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=918.3599999999999s)]
*  going to get magically created so that you don't object when he gives all of his donors [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=922.64s)]
*  a $4.5 trillion tax cut. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=928.0400000000001s)]
*  That's what's happening here. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=930.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and in fact, in previous interviews and on the campaign trail, Trump was, he put [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=931.76s)]
*  his trade policies together with tax cuts, essentially arguing we can cut taxes and have [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=939.4s)]
*  the federal government raise revenue through tariffs. But we all know that that's not really [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=946.5600000000001s)]
*  going to work when the tariffs are going to be paid for by American consumers. And so, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=951.8000000000001s)]
*  look, we'll see how this plays out. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=957.28s)]
*  But I don't think your theory is a crazy one. I think there's actually a lot of merit to [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=958.96s)]
*  it. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=963.32s)]
*  And another theory, which is that they're a runaway freight train, totally reckless. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=964.32s)]
*  And that is also what's happening here. Jim Cramer on CNBC was like, wait, we don't even [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=967.2s)]
*  know how these tariffs are going to be applied. And every company is asking, what do we do? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=972.44s)]
*  Do we pay the US government? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=977.72s)]
*  Well- [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=979.72s)]
*  How is this going to work? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=980.22s)]
*  Let's go to that video. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=981.6s)]
*  They didn't plan any of that out. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=982.6s)]
*  We actually have that video. So here's Jim Cramer on CNBC, his hair on fire. Let's watch. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=983.6s)]
*  Well, but just to say, there's just vast confusion. No one knows. I mean, the automakers don't [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=988.6s)]
*  know what this is going to mean. The packaged goods companies don't always mean when it [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=994.56s)]
*  comes from another country. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=997.88s)]
*  There's no clarity whatsoever. Anyone who thinks that there's clarity is just completely [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=999.72s)]
*  wrong. The lack of any thought about this, David, is stunning. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1002.56s)]
*  It is. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1007.76s)]
*  There's a huge amount of money involved. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1008.8s)]
*  Potentially, yeah. It's also, it goes beyond that, I think. And obviously, we've talked [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1010.48s)]
*  about uncertainty. I mean, we talk about it always, every day for decades. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1015.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1019.3199999999999s)]
*  We talk about it. But it is higher now. And the conversations that I'm having, it's not [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  just, all right, trying to understand and figure this out. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1025.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1027.76s)]
*  And as you say, it's very much opaque. But it's also, well, will it be in effect in 10 [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1028.76s)]
*  days? Will it be in effect in 30 days? Will it be reversed? Will it be increased? I think [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1032.12s)]
*  that raises the level of uncertainty which is reflected in a premium coming out of stocks [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1037.48s)]
*  to a certain extent, or a higher risk premium, if you want to call it that. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  Look, I got to admit, watching Jim Cramer on the verge of tears as he considers the [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1048.16s)]
*  damage done to his stock portfolio is a little bit of a silver lining in the story, but only [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1053.64s)]
*  a tiny, tiny silver lining. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1059.24s)]
*  Yeah. And remember, so, yeah, they're talking about tariffs a little bit, but their main [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1061.64s)]
*  point is, no one has any idea what this Trump administration is doing, because they don't [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1065.96s)]
*  know. They won't put out guidance on how do we even do the tariffs? Who do we pay? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1071.64s)]
*  That's because they're a runaway freight train, totally reckless, or they don't know [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1079.76s)]
*  exactly what they're doing. They're going with the Elon method. This comes from Silicon [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1085.3600000000001s)]
*  Valley, move fast and break things. That might work on X, I'm not even sure it works [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1089.72s)]
*  there, but it certainly is not going to work with the US government. And the stock market [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1097.32s)]
*  absolutely crashing at this point is proof that you can't move fast and break things at [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1101.88s)]
*  the national level and not have consequences for all of the rest of us. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5_VSoyikX4&t=1107.96s)]
