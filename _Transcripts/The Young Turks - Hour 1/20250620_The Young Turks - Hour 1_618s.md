"A federal judge announced Friday that he will order the release of Palestinian activist and Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil.
Khalil was first detained by immigration authorities at his campus apartment in March. Officials within President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration ‚Äî as well as Trump himself ‚Äî have insisted that the graduate student organized pro-Hamas activities at Columbia. Student protesters on campus demanded that the university divest from companies supporting the war in Gaza, and Khalil was the lead negotiator between the students and the university."

# Judge Orders Trump Admin To Release Mahmoud Khalil
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY)
*  If you let Israel kill freedom of speech for people who are here legally, that means you're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=0.0s)]
*  killing it for US citizens. Even if you don't care about immigrants, that means you're killing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=5.76s)]
*  it for US citizens on behalf of a foreign government. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=11.44s)]
*  Federal judge earlier today ordered the US government to finally free former Columbia [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=15.44s)]
*  University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil from the Immigrant Detention Center where [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=20.16s)]
*  he's been held since early March. This is US District Judge Michael Farbyars, who said [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=24.32s)]
*  it was highly, highly unusual for the government to continue to detain a legal US resident [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=29.6s)]
*  who was unlikely to flee and hadn't been accused of any violence. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  He said Khalil is likely not a flight risk and quote is not a danger to the community, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=38.72s)]
*  period, full stop. And to be clear, he has not just not been accused of any violence, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=43.2s)]
*  he hasn't been accused of any crimes. The official line from the government is they [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=48.5s)]
*  find the positions he has on the genocide so distasteful that he has to be locked up [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=53.68s)]
*  for months. He has been locked up in jail for almost four months because Trump doesn't like [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=61.52s)]
*  his position on the war. That's it. His positions are so crucially politically incorrect that he [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=67.6s)]
*  had to be locked up and kept away from the public because he might infect them with his anti-war [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=75.2s)]
*  positions. In any event, this comes after several other scholars have been targeted [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=79.12s)]
*  for their activism. They've also been released but earlier than Mahmoud Khalil, who was the first [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=84.48s)]
*  who was seized during this spate of censorship. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=89.84s)]
*  You have a former Palestinian student at Columbia, Mohsen Mahdawi, a Tufts University student, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Ramesa Aztariq and a Georgetown University scholar, Bader Khan Suri, who all were detained and all [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=98.48s)]
*  were ordered to be released. And obviously Khalil finally being released was seen as good news by [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=105.2s)]
*  his wife who has been away from her partner for a third of a year now for absolutely nothing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=111.84s)]
*  She says, we know this ruling does not begin to address the injustices the Trump administration [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  has brought upon our family and so many others. But today we are celebrating Mahmoud coming back [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=125.76s)]
*  to New York to be reunited with our little family. And that is good news. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=130.56s)]
*  Assuming the Trump administration actually abides by the ruling, we'll have to see. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=135.44s)]
*  Yeah, John, the only bone I have to pick with you is your headline was a little wrong. It's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=140.16s)]
*  Israeli hostage released inside America. So it was donors who want America to serve Israel [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=146.4s)]
*  that ordered the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil. There's no other reason to arrest him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=154.72s)]
*  And this judge, by the way, if you think, it's biased, liberal judge, no, he's the one that said [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=158.96s)]
*  in the first round, no, they have a right to detain him and deport him if they can prove their case. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=163.52s)]
*  So at the time people are like, maybe he's a pro-Trump judge, right? No, he's like, no, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=169.12s)]
*  you gotta show me the evidence. So they bring him in. And he's like, okay, give me evidence of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=172.96s)]
*  any violent act he did. We don't have any. Okay, how about property destruction? We don't have any. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=177.28s)]
*  Okay, how about any crime? We don't have any. So then why the hell did you arrest them? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=183.52s)]
*  And they're like, it could be that maybe there was a problem in his visa. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=190.0s)]
*  Yeah, but what do you mean maybe there was a problem in his visa? Is there a problem in his visa? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  We're not gonna present any evidence. He's like, well, then yeah, if you arrest a guy for [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=199.68s)]
*  absolutely no reason, yes, you have to release him. That's our laws in America. It's not complicated. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=204.4s)]
*  This is like the easiest case he's ever had to deal with. When the government presents [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=211.2s)]
*  zero evidence of any crime, no, you can't keep him. But the government says, but to be fair, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=215.44s)]
*  he has criticized beloved Israel. And remember when we burned our constitution and got rid of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=222.0s)]
*  the First Amendment or actually just crossed it out. You have freedom of speech, unless you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=227.92s)]
*  criticize Israel, in which case you'll be locked up because AIPAC gave hundreds of millions of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=232.72s)]
*  dollars to our congresspeople and to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=237.44s)]
*  But to be fair to Biden, he didn't do this and he wouldn't as terrible as Biden was, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=243.28s)]
*  as he was an enabler of genocide and paid for a genocide. He didn't go the extra mile of saying, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=247.6s)]
*  I'll end freedom of speech in America on behalf of Israel. That was Donald Trump. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=254.48s)]
*  So thank God for the American court system. Thank God we're a democracy and a constitutional [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=259.44s)]
*  republic. So the judge said, no, you have to let that Israeli hostage go. He didn't do anything [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  wrong. And yes, he does have freedom of speech in America. Trey. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=268.96s)]
*  Trey Bregman Yeah, I mean, this, at least he [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  finally is getting out. But the fact that this can happen and can last this long, I mean, he spent [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=277.12s)]
*  months in there for literally nothing. It should be alarming to everybody. I mean, I get cheeky [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=281.84s)]
*  sometimes and joke about how like, yeah, I'm gonna end up in the gulag one day if this keeps up or [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  whatever. And it's like, obviously, it's a little different. I'm a white guy from Tennessee, but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=291.2s)]
*  still, like, I mean, they really have ripped up the Constitution to make political prisoners out [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=296.4s)]
*  of people who say things that they don't like. And there's people, you know, I guarantee there's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  plenty of people who would tell you they are in part Trump supporters because you know what, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  they're free speech absolutists. That whole argument who yet will twist themselves into [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=310.64s)]
*  knives trying to justify this or just ignoring it and pretending it doesn't happen. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  But this is like, this type of thing is scary. It's the type of thing you should you would hope [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=320.56s)]
*  wouldn't be imaginable in this country if it actually worked the way it purports to and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  clearly it doesn't, and in particular under this regime. So again, so ultimately, at least so far, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=333.76s)]
*  unless they just, you know, decide to ignore this or do something even worse, seems like [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=339.68s)]
*  the right thing happened at the end of the day, at least, but it took way too long and should have [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=344.96s)]
*  never even, you know, needed to happen in the first place. So it's bad. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=349.84s)]
*  Yeah, and Mahmoud Khalil and his family should sue this government of Israel. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=359.2s)]
*  You're allowed to sue terrorist organizations to get compensation. And Israel, you know, having [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=360.08s)]
*  destroyed almost every hospital in Gaza, having destroyed almost everything in Gaza, having [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=366.32s)]
*  murdered over 50,000 people, having murdered over 17,000 kids is obviously a terrorist state. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=370.4s)]
*  And they have intentionally murdered those people and we've shown it a time again and again and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=376.64s)]
*  again. And now they're coming to kidnap people on our streets through our corrupt dirtbag politicians. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=382.32s)]
*  And so Trump should be sued. And if you're MAGA, you're like, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm a free speech [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=389.04s)]
*  absolutist like Trey said, but he's an immigrant. I hate immigrants. So let's just get rid of our [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=394.24s)]
*  freedom of speech. The freedom of speech is for America, everyone in America. The Supreme Court [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=399.36s)]
*  has ruled out for 200 years straight. If you let Israel kill freedom of speech for people who are [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=404.4s)]
*  here legally, that means you're killing it for US citizens. Even if you don't care about immigrants, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=410.32s)]
*  that means you're killing it for US citizens on behalf of a foreign government. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=417.44s)]
*  Okay, now, if you don't get that and you say no, he shouldn't be allowed to criticize Israel. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=422.88s)]
*  No, Israel should rule us. And Israel should be allowed to kidnap anyone they like off an [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=427.67999999999995s)]
*  American street for criticizing beloved Israel. You criticizing a genocide? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=431.92s)]
*  This is like the Germans having us arrest people who are opposed to the Holocaust [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=438.16s)]
*  here in America. He criticized the German government. He criticized the German government. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  He has no business here. Lock him up. But did he do anything wrong? No, but he criticized the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=447.04s)]
*  Germans. I mean, all they're doing is a Holocaust. My God, are you offended? Are you offended? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=452.0s)]
*  I'm 10,000 times more offended at the 17,000 dead Palestinian kids. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=458.0s)]
*  But no, I know, mustering up. No, I care. I care about the Palestinians who died. I care. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=464.56s)]
*  I mean, I don't care as much as you offending me. Your words are problematic. Let's lock him up. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=470.24s)]
*  Let's lock him up. Let's go. Let's go. Israel, take more hostages in America. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=475.52s)]
*  And thank God the courts are stopping it. And so Trump's total and utter joke on freedom of speech [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=480.32s)]
*  and America first. That guy didn't even criticize America. And by the way, no one's gotten arrested [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=486.56s)]
*  for criticizing America. You can criticize America all day, all night, as by the way you should be [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=492.08s)]
*  allowed to. Freedom of speech. But you criticize Israel, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble in [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=497.04s)]
*  this country. This is insanity. My family moved here. We didn't move to Israel. We moved here [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=501.6s)]
*  because we love America. If we knew that it was gonna be controlled by Israel, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=511.84s)]
*  I don't know that we- Are we telling everybody that? This is America, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=517.76s)]
*  but our politicians all work for Israel? God damn it, man. If you're America first, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=521.92s)]
*  you should hate this more than anyone else. For God's sake, man, kidnapping people off the streets [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=527.2s)]

*  Is that too much to ask for? And if you say they're not giving us orders, you're hilarious. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9uzToxJmY&t=575.4399999999999s)]
