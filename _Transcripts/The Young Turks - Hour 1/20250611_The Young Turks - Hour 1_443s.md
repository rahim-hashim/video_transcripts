"GOP Sen. Rand Paul is accusing the White House of ‚Äúimmaturity‚Äù and engaging in ‚Äúpetty vindictiveness‚Äù after he and his family were disinvited from the annual White House picnic long held with members of both parties.
Paul, a libertarian-minded deficit hawk who has been raising deep concerns over President Donald Trump‚Äôs sweeping policy bill, said his family ‚Äì including his nearly six-month-old grandson ‚Äî had been planning on attending Thursday‚Äôs bipartisan picnic on the White House lawn. But Paul said their invitation was abruptly rescinded with no real explanation, even as the move came after Trump and his aides have been bashing Paul over his position on the president‚Äôs bill for days."*

# Rand Paul Calls Trump "Immature" After Being Uninvited From The White House Picnic
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw)
*  He said they were carrying a war against his family cuz they don't get to go to a picnic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=0.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=5.12s)]
*  So embarrassed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=6.08s)]
*  The cool kids didn't invite you to their 15th birthday in high school. That's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=6.88s)]
*  literally what he's complaining about right now. It's so insanely tone deaf and ridiculous. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=14.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of a great time of the year in the summer. My family comes up. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  My son and daughter-in-law and grandson are coming up because we were going to the White [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=25.28s)]
*  House picnic. But I've just been told that I've been uninvited from the picnic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=28.56s)]
*  I think I'm the first senator in the history of the United States to be uninvited to the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=33.12s)]
*  White House picnic. The White House is owned by the taxpayers. We all are members of it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=36.72s)]
*  Every Democrat will be invited. Every Republican will be invited, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  but I will be the only one disallowed to come on the grounds of the White House. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=45.84s)]
*  Can I go to the White House picnic since the White House belongs to the American people? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  What was that argument? That was Senator Rand Paul. And what you just watched was a snippet [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=56.24s)]
*  of the Republican senator basically whining to reporters for seven minutes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=61.84s)]
*  Okay, we just showed you a snippet. But for seven minutes, he was complaining about how he was [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=67.12s)]
*  disinvited from the White House picnic. I gotta be honest with you, Oz. I would be relieved. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=72.16s)]
*  Okay, when plans are canceled, tell me you're not relieved. I mean, in some cases- [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=79.2s)]
*  Oftentimes, oftentimes, I am more often than not. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=84.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, that's fine. I guess we can't do that one thing that I barely wanted to show up to anyway. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  So true. So look, what is this all about? Why did the Trump administration disinvite [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=99.52s)]
*  good old Rand Paul? Let's hear a little more from Rand Paul, and then we'll discuss [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=104.88s)]
*  why Trump has soured on him. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=110.96s)]
*  I mean, I have been, I think, nothing but polite to the president. I have been an [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  intellectual opponent, a public policy opponent, and he's chosen now to uninvite me from the picnic [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=122.8s)]
*  and to say my grandson can't come to the picnic. The level of immaturity is beyond words. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=129.2s)]
*  I've been here long enough that if anybody has ever followed me, I've been a critic of Obama. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=140.24s)]
*  I've been a critic of Biden. I've been a critic of the previous Trump, but always in a, I think, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=144.48s)]
*  a reasonable fashion along policy. And so they've decided they wanted to declare war on my family [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=150.72s)]
*  and exclude us from the White House. And I just think it's incredibly petty. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  And I hope someone will ask them some questions about how they have decided to sink to this step. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=164.64s)]
*  What was the explanation given to you? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=170.16s)]
*  No explanation, we're just not welcome. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=171.68s)]
*  So he says that he's been given no explanation. I'm sure he suspects it has to do with the fact [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=174.8s)]
*  that he made the same grave error that Elon Musk did, which is the fact that he's not in favor of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=183.84s)]
*  Trump's tax cut and border spending bill, which will add quite a bit to our national debt, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=190.08s)]
*  which currently sits at $36, $37 trillion, costs a trillion dollars a year to service. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=196.64s)]
*  Rand Paul's concerns are legitimate. I'm sure I would disagree with Rand Paul in how to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  cut the deficit or I should say debt causing provisions in that bill. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=212.0s)]
*  He's gonna wanna cut more spending on social services, the social safety net. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=218.88s)]
*  I say why are we cutting taxes on the rich right now at a time when we obviously need more revenue [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=223.84s)]
*  and we need to do something about the deficit and the debt. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=229.68s)]
*  Now, Paul, a libertarian leaning Republican from Kentucky generally supports Trump but has been [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=232.8s)]
*  willing to criticize the administration's policies on areas like spending and tariffs. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=237.76s)]
*  He's also the Senate GOP's one no vote at this current moment on Trump's so-called big, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=242.96s)]
*  beautiful bill. Paul has indicated that he could not support the bill because it includes an [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=249.84s)]
*  increase of the national debt limit. But he's said that he's open to considering it if GOP leaders [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=256.32s)]
*  remove that from the overall bill. The White House and top Republicans have rebuffed Paul's demand. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=262.32s)]
*  So look, it's definitely a risky, this is not a risky move for Trump. Trump just won his battle [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=270.08s)]
*  with Elon Musk. Elon Musk, tuck tail, apologize publicly. Trump is gonna win. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=276.0s)]
*  The question is, is Rand Paul, I guess as brave and effective as Congressman Thomas Massey who [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=283.76s)]
*  did not cave in to pressure from Donald Trump? I just don't know if Rand Paul is as principled [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=292.64s)]
*  as Thomas Massey is. I'm curious what you think, Was. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=298.8s)]
*  He's not, you know how I know he's not? He's so freaking DC brained that the most personal [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=302.0s)]
*  offense that could be given is not being invited to a party. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=310.4s)]
*  That's literally what DC is about, being at the right parties, at the right events, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=315.76s)]
*  getting the right invites. And making sure you're able to say that you rub shoulders with the right [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=320.56s)]
*  people who are in the right positions. And he said they were carrying a war against his family [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=326.48s)]
*  cuz they don't get to go to a picnic. That's insane, bro. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=332.16s)]
*  To that point, I don't think Thomas Massey would say something like that. If Trump did that to him, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=338.0s)]
*  he would definitely broadcast it, but broadcast it in a way as like, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=346.56s)]
*  I'm fighting for my constituents. I don't care about a White House picnic. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=350.8s)]
*  Exactly. Whereas Rand Paul's like, I'm losing his mind about it. It's so embarrassing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=354.8s)]
*  Kids didn't invite you to their 15th birthday in high school. That's literally what he's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=361.76s)]
*  complaining about right now. It's so insanely tone deaf and ridiculous. And mind you, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=367.36s)]
*  and Anna got to this point. The reason he's not in favor of this bill cuz there's not enough [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  social security cut, Medicaid cut. That's what he wants. No, no, no, those insane tax cuts [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=380.64s)]
*  for our most blessed citizens. No, no, no, that's cool. We need to be taking away goods and services [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=388.4s)]
*  from everyday average working people. Yeah, that's exactly right. That is exactly right. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  What a maniac. And that's why Trump could smack him around. Because guess what? All right, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=402.4s)]
*  go in front of the cameras and be like, no, because I'm advocating for more cuts [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=408.08s)]
*  to you guys' entitlements. He's not inviting me to the party. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  It's such a good point. You wanna sound stupid, kid. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=415.84s)]
*  Yeah, not a sympathetic figure, right? But still, he didn't have the common sense to avoid whining [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=420.24s)]
*  publicly about the picnic. But there you have it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=428.0s)]
*  Donald's not inviting me to his party of Chuck E. Cheese. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=431.28s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=433.36s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdTwBDY_Ezw&t=439.36s)]
