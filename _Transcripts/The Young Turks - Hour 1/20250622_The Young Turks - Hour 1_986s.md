TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# FIRE FIVE: Ana DEMOLISHES Mark Levin
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI)
*  Then Yahoo comes back in a couple of weeks cuz yeah, I'm gonna do it. What are you gonna do about it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=0.0s)]
*  Huh? And Trump is nothing, nothing. I'm just sorry. So not a man. Okay, not a leader. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=3.84s)]
*  Are we really pretending like the Israelis and the IDF, they're angels. They would never do [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=9.84s)]
*  anything barbaric. They would never do something as disgusting and barbaric as [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=15.84s)]
*  shooting and killing over 100 Palestinians in Gaza yesterday alone. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=21.76s)]
*  That is a man who's gonna make sure this generation and future generations are protected [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=30.0s)]
*  from nuclear missiles coming out of the Middle East from barbarian primitives from the seventh [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=40.32s)]
*  century. That's what he wants to do. Iran, look, we covered that story [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=46.32s)]
*  of the young woman who was executed because she wasn't wearing her headdress perfectly. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  A little bit of her hair was showing. She was imprisoned. There are mass protests around it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=58.56s)]
*  And eventually she was executed and that was so barbaric and so gross. And a lot of countries [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=63.28s)]
*  across the globe do barbaric and gross things. We don't threaten to invade them. We don't risk [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=69.44s)]
*  the lives of our soldiers to invade them. It's not our job to be the world's police. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  But now let's talk about the barbarism and barbaric behavior on the other side. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=81.36s)]
*  Are the Israelis who are currently carrying out a genocide in Gaza really gonna tell us [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=85.92s)]
*  about how this is a war between civilization and barbarism? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=89.84s)]
*  Who are the barbarians here? Because I see a lot of barbaric activity happening [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=97.92s)]
*  and carried out by the IDF. Dude, they bombed the Iranian embassy in Syria. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  They bombed it. Think about how crazy that is. And in retaliation, you wanna know what Iran did, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=112.24s)]
*  that scary country that's gonna drop a nuke on the United States and Israel. You wanna know what [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=118.08s)]
*  they did in retaliation? They waited a while and then they let the United States and Israel know. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  72 hours in advance, we're going to do these drone strikes. Here's where the drone strikes are gonna [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  be. The US shot them down. Jordan shot them down. Not a single civilian was harmed. Not a single [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  person was harmed. There was a little bit of property damage. But what are we doing here? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=141.44s)]
*  Are we really pretending the Israelis and the IDF, they're angels. They would never do anything [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=145.44s)]
*  barbaric. They would never do something as disgusting and barbaric as shooting and killing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=151.76s)]
*  over 100 Palestinians in Gaza yesterday alone as they were at those humanitarian hubs trying to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=158.4s)]
*  get flour so they don't die of starvation. You know what that is? That's barbaric. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=164.56s)]
*  That's barbaric. Yeah, go ahead, call me an anti-Semite when I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=169.36s)]
*  give you a specific thing that happened just yesterday in Gaza that is barbaric. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  Don't talk to me ever about how this is a war between civilization and barbarism. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=183.28s)]
*  It's plenty of barbaric garbage happening right now at the hands of the IDF. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=188.56s)]
*  That doesn't provide cover for the barbaric stuff that happens [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  at the hands of the Shiite leadership in Iran. But if we're gonna use this case [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=197.12s)]
*  as justification for invading Iran, well, the same argument could be made for Israel. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=206.32s)]
*  So I would be real careful. I want to thank Israel for this. Is Iran the reason for any of this? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=212.4s)]
*  Is Iran the reason the corporations in America just pillage and leave the trail of death and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  destruction in their wake? Is Iran the reason we have no healthcare? I mean, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=222.96s)]
*  this is the most disdain I've ever heard. Thank God for guys like Dylan. If that hurts [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=228.08s)]
*  your feelings, I couldn't care less. So what we needed in this country was independent media. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  And so what we had was mainstream media and it was a prison. It was an absolute prison. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  But you couldn't get any opinion out that wasn't sanctioned by the special interests in Washington. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=242.88s)]
*  Now there's a prison break and we're in the populist woods. So now, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  Tim Dylan and guys like him supported Trump. But there's nothing tying him financially or otherwise [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=253.84s)]
*  to Trump or anyone else. So they're saying, that's it. I'm gonna tell you the truth. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=259.6s)]
*  And I don't work for established media. I don't need to lie to you. I don't have any sponsors [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=264.16s)]
*  that demand that I lied to you. I don't have any special interests that demand that I lied to you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  So I'm gonna tell you the truth. The truth is we don't need to be in this war at all. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=271.76s)]
*  Israel is trying to drag us into this war. And now how are they gonna shut up all the independent [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  media? Okay, now you gotta shut up the Young Turks, which they've been trying to do for [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=280.0s)]
*  20 some odd years. Then you gotta go shut up Joe Rogan and Tim Dylan and Andrew Schultz and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=283.84s)]
*  Charlemagne. It's hard to shut all these people up. Especially if you pretended that you were in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  favor of free speech, you were against cancel culture and you were anti-war. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=292.96s)]
*  So Donald Trump is in a lot of trouble, cuz he is violating every single core tenant that he [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=297.76s)]
*  promised to his own voters. And now all of a sudden, I got Tim Dylan and Rogan and Dave Smith [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=304.24s)]
*  and so many others, even Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Steve Bannon. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=309.36s)]
*  I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Saying yeah, anti-war and we meant it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=314.08s)]
*  Anti-war and we meant it, okay? Look, whatever you think of their media leaders, their political [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=320.08s)]
*  leaders, I know so many on the left will tell you no, all their voters are liars. They're not, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=326.72s)]
*  why would a voter be a liar? What's their incentive to lie? No, they said they were [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=333.36s)]
*  anti-war cuz they are anti-war. Can they get tricked into a war? Well, that we're finding [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=338.64s)]
*  that out together right now. So a lot of their media guys proved to be true. Now saying, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  if my God, look guys, I'm not saying these guys are great on other issues. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  Steve Bannon is a nightmare on other issues. Jack Posobiak, I couldn't scream more with that guy [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=354.0s)]
*  on thousand issues, right? But they're all over their heirs like Tim is going, don't go in. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=359.2s)]
*  Don't go in. This is not our war. This is Israel's war. And their voters are saying don't go in. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=365.44s)]
*  So that's why Trump's in a conundrum. Take the win. It's never happened before. United States [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  of America, I know that you're not in the mood to unite with anybody if you're on the left and you [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=376.0s)]
*  see what's happening in the streets of LA, etc, right? But this is an actual anti-war coalition. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=380.96s)]
*  So in LA, of course, we had this massive protest downtown. And like you're saying, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=386.08s)]
*  it was peaceful after the fact. There are people still hanging around. And there was this incredible [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  moment on MSNBC where Jacob Sobrioff is saying, yes, it has been 100% peaceful. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  Within 30 seconds, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department started firing less lethals, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  whole conversation around that for another day, into the crowd. And you saw from there, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=408.56s)]
*  things were escalated. It was almost like perfect timing and him reminding the viewers everything [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=414.16s)]
*  was peaceful to law enforcement escalating. And I really wanna stress this happens all the time. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=420.72s)]
*  So when you see people reacting or throwing things, it's important to understand where so [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=427.04s)]
*  many of the times that's how things originate, especially here. On step two, it's yes, what does [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=431.44000000000005s)]
*  it look like from there? I would hope that new connections were formed. I would hope that this [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=436.88s)]
*  empowers people and inspires people to participate, to get involved and to remain [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=443.28s)]
*  involved going forward. And what does that look like? So I tell you, I was thinking about this [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=448.08s)]
*  all weekend. I have a video over on the Insurgence YouTube channel for my podcast where I laid out [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=453.52s)]
*  what I've seen in my own community, in my own neighborhood. People have established a rapid [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=458.79999999999995s)]
*  response network. So if ICE comes to our neighborhood, which seems inevitable at this point, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=462.88s)]
*  there are people who are volunteering to show up. There are community events that happen weekly [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  that they're volunteering to stay on guard and protect the street vendors. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=472.48s)]
*  And even on Sunday night, I'd say over a thousand people gathered in Highland Park, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  waving their signs, beeping their horns as traffic went by to remind people, hey, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=482.72s)]
*  we're all in this together. And if you are undocumented and if you are in peril, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  you could be next. We've got your back, we're going to look out for you. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  It's going to take more than that. And I would encourage everyone to, if you're not here, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  if you're not even in one of those democratic cities that they're going after, start to build [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=502.48s)]
*  that infrastructure proactively before ICE and DHS comes to your town. So when they single out [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  these towns, New York, Chicago, LA, they're doing it to drive a political narrative. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=513.2s)]
*  But if you look at the data, Pew Research did a study and they published it in 2024, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=517.76s)]
*  relying on data from 2022 that showed where undocumented people live in the United States. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=522.08s)]
*  The top two and three after California in terms of states with the most undocumented people [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=528.32s)]
*  are Florida and Texas. You don't see Trump talking about those two states [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=534.4000000000001s)]
*  because it doesn't fit their narrative. They want to go after sanctuary city laws, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  which just precludes local law enforcement from participating in DHS and ICE raids. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=542.6400000000001s)]
*  That's all it is. And they use that as pretext to demonize an entire city, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=549.7600000000001s)]
*  cities of millions of people, and convey a false pretense and mislead viewers, especially in [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=554.88s)]
*  right-wing media, about the realities on the ground here. What you're seeing here is inspiring. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=560.4s)]
*  And what you're going to see in Chicago when things get amped up there and in New York [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=565.12s)]
*  are going to be similar. People don't want federal agents and Marines and the National Guard coming [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=569.6s)]
*  in and ripping people off the streets and sending them to God knows where. They don't have due [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  process in these situations. It is invasive. It is scary. It can be dangerous at times. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=581.04s)]
*  So I would encourage all of you to proactively start to organize in your community for when [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  ICE eventually comes to your town. APEC, I wish were much more effective. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=592.88s)]
*  My understanding having known a lot of people who worked at APEC is that it lobbies on behalf [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=598.16s)]
*  of the Israeli government. Wrong. Okay. When was the last time APEC took a position that deviated [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=603.04s)]
*  from Prime Minister Netanyahu? All the time. Okay. Let me go back and give a little history. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=609.36s)]
*  If you want to do a deep dive on APEC- I don't. I want to do a shallow dive. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=616.64s)]
*  I want to get to the core question. APEC is lobbying for a foreign government. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not. No. It's lobbying for the United States. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=625.28s)]
*  It is lobbying for a strong US-Israeli relationship. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=627.52s)]
*  That was amazing. I mean, look, I hate to be in a position where I'm praising a man [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=631.28s)]
*  who I have far more disagreements with than agreements with, but I don't care. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=638.0s)]
*  I don't care. This interview was incredible. First of all, how illuminating is it [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=642.32s)]
*  that we literally have a sitting United States Senator who openly says that he came into the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=649.92s)]
*  Senate promising to be the number one representative and defender of Israel of a foreign country. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=657.12s)]
*  Of a foreign country. If that doesn't infuriate you, there's something wrong with you. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=664.32s)]
*  He was supposed to represent this country, the constituents who voted him in the great state of [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=669.84s)]
*  Texas, right? And he feels like it's totally okay to openly say, I came into the Senate, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=676.96s)]
*  committed to be the number one representative supporter. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=685.36s)]
*  I can't remember the exact word he used, but basically to represent Israel's interests. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=688.88s)]
*  Oh, so look, given that he feels comfortable saying that openly, which I'm not interested [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  in having anyone in Congress who prioritizes any foreign country over our own. I'm Armenian-American, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=701.2s)]
*  right? If someone came into Congress and said, you know what? I came into Senate wanting to be [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=708.24s)]
*  the number one representative of Armenia, I'd be like, but why? But why? No, we have problems here. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  Ted Cruz is like, no, no, I mean, it's not a foreign lobby. These are Americans. They're [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=721.2s)]
*  not doing any coordination with Israel. But they are, but they literally are. Throughout his career, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=725.2s)]
*  he has taken in $562,593 from AIPAC specifically. Just something to know about. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=732.88s)]
*  Netanyahu told the US intelligence and Trump, sometime in the last two months, listen, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=742.0s)]
*  I don't really care about you. You're gonna keep sending me money cuz [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=748.64s)]
*  you're a sucker and I own you, okay? So you don't have any right to do anything about what I'm doing, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  okay? But I'm going to go attack Iran, whether you like it or not. You understand me? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=760.8s)]
*  And Trump was like, okay, okay. So then they started changing the game planning, the war [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=764.88s)]
*  planning inside the White House to, okay, Israel's definitely going to attack. Now there, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=769.44s)]
*  if Trump was a man, what he would have done is, what'd you say? Did you just boss me around [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=775.0400000000001s)]
*  and tell me that you're gonna do that attack even though I told you not to? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=780.32s)]
*  Which he very clearly said in April not to. Trump told Netanyahu that. Netanyahu comes back in a [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  couple of weeks cuz, yeah, I'm gonna do it. What are you gonna do about it, huh? And Trump goes, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=788.48s)]
*  nothing, nothing, I'm just sorry. So not a man, okay, not a leader, and certainly not anti-war. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=792.32s)]
*  It looks like by all indications, New York Times reporting and everything that Donald Trump has [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=798.8s)]
*  said publicly, we are going to go on the offense. We are going to start a war with Iran as the United [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=802.4799999999999s)]
*  States of America. And it's Israel's war, it has nothing to do with us, nothing, nothing. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  They don't have nukes, it's all a lie, has absolutely nothing to do with America. But [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=816.24s)]
*  we're going to be forced to pay for this war. We're already paying a ton of money, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=822.24s)]
*  the press never reports that all those missiles cost money. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=826.32s)]
*  You're going on the offense is gonna cost a lot more money. And God help us if we gotta go on [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=828.88s)]
*  the ground. Okay, so but the third option is, hey, America, you do it on your own, okay? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=833.2s)]
*  We started it, we're not gonna fight it. We're not gonna risk precious Israeli lives. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=839.6800000000001s)]
*  Why don't you use your worthless American soldiers to go die for us? Do you know that they said, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=847.0400000000001s)]
*  the neocon said that the Iraq war would only cost 1.9 billion? Instead, it literally costs at least [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=852.88s)]
*  1000 times that, it costs over $2 trillion. And now they're telling Trump the same exact lie. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=861.84s)]
*  Donnie, this is gonna be so easy. No, no, we just bombed their nuclear, I mean, we don't do it, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=870.08s)]
*  we can't do it, we don't have the capability to do it. So then why'd you start the war? We knew [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=875.92s)]
*  that if we start the war, even though we can't accomplish our mission of knocking out their [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=880.64s)]
*  non-existent nukes, America will do it for us. And so now the moron Donald Trump thinks, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=885.36s)]
*  oh yeah, I'm gonna be strong like Israel. Yeah, I'll fight this war for that. I'll knock out [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=894.08s)]
*  their nukes. So they're planning, and again, they don't have that. They have nuclear facilities for [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=899.04s)]
*  energy. And it's been confirmed by the world that it is for energy. Now, are they trying to [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=903.52s)]
*  enrich the uranium past that? Because they started to worry that Israel's gonna attack them unless [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=908.4000000000001s)]
*  they have nukes? I don't know. I know that they're enriching uranium a little bit more now, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=912.8000000000001s)]
*  but they don't even have a weapon to put it on. And it would take over a year for them to produce [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=917.9200000000001s)]
*  that weapon, not according to me. According to Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend, he said that. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=921.84s)]
*  They're still, even by Netanyahu's standards, well over a year away from having that be a weapon. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=926.4000000000001s)]
*  So there is no weapon to bomb there, okay? There are facilities. So we're gonna go and do that, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=932.4s)]
*  apparently. That's apparently imminent. By the way, when we do that, our troops are sitting ducks [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=939.12s)]
*  all across the Middle East. They don't have Iron Dome. They're just waiting there to get killed on [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=945.04s)]
*  behalf of Israel so that Donald Trump and the neocons can come out and go, that's it. Iran attacked [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=949.84s)]
*  America, war, war, war, war, war. And Jordan, the last part of it is, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=955.2s)]
*  boom, they move the goalposts. And you'll see this all over the media now. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=962.32s)]
*  We tell you ahead of time now, you're gonna notice it if you make the mistake of turning on cable [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=966.32s)]
*  news or engaging in mainstream media in other ways. Now it's no longer knocking out their [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=970.88s)]
*  non-existent nukes, it's a regime change. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=976.96s)]
*  the swings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xV4WDfcCI&t=981.92s)]
