"President Trump announced a sweeping new tariff plan at a Rose Garden ceremony, a stark shift in U.S. trade policy.

The U.S. will impose a 10% tariff on all imports and much higher rates for some nations, Trump said in unveiling a series of moves he declared "Liberation Day" for U.S. trade policy."

# Trump SPOOKS Markets After Announcing SWEEPING Tariffs
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro)
*  My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day, waiting for a long time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=0.0s)]
*  April 2nd, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=7.92s)]
*  the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Well, we have finally gotten Trump's big Liberation Day announcement, of course, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=23.52s)]
*  having to do with the tariffs that he intends to implement on various countries and our trade [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=30.88s)]
*  partners. He gave us a comprehensive look at his trade policies, in fact, which he'd been [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=35.76s)]
*  hyping up for some time. Let's just keep it real. In fact, for anyone who is upset about the fact [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=41.6s)]
*  that these tariffs are now being implemented, they're supposed to go into effect this month, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=47.04s)]
*  he had been campaigning on this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=52.96s)]
*  And one should wonder why it is that you didn't have a Democratic candidate, whether it was Biden [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=55.04s)]
*  when he was the nominee or Kamala Harris when she was the nominee, campaigning against it, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=60.08s)]
*  because he did talk about these tariffs incessantly on the campaign trail. And now he's saying, look, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=65.2s)]
*  promises kept. So here's what we know so far. It's not exactly clear how the Trump administration [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=72.24s)]
*  arrived at some of these numbers. But with that in mind, let's go to the next clip where [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=78.88s)]
*  you're gonna get some specificity. For nations that treat us badly, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=88.56s)]
*  forms of cheating. And because we are being very kind, we're kind people, but we will charge them [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=94.24s)]
*  approximately half of what they are and have been charging us. If you look at that, China, first row, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=100.88s)]
*  China, 67%, that's tariffs charged to the USA, including currency manipulation and trade barriers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=108.32s)]
*  So 67%, I think you can for the most part see it. So 67%, so we're gonna be charging [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=117.52s)]
*  a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34%. I think in other words, they charge us, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  we charge them, we charge them less. So how can anybody be upset? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=129.68s)]
*  Okay, so it was a little subtle, but during his speech, he kind of made clear that there are [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=132.64s)]
*  countries we like, countries that he feels that we can further negotiate with. And so with our [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=141.2s)]
*  allies, with those trade partners, he has decided to give them a little bit of a discount [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=147.92s)]
*  reciprocal tariff. And so I'll get to those countries in just a moment. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=153.2s)]
*  But some nations will be hit with what Trump called discounted reciprocal tariffs and others [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=157.68s)]
*  will be hit with steeper tariffs on any import coming from that country to the United States. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=163.36s)]
*  So the higher rates are for nations, the White House again considers bad actors on trade. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  Duties will be 34% on China and 24% on Japan. I'm sorry, 24% on China, 24% on Japan and 20% [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=176.0s)]
*  on the EU. In fact, why don't we take a look at the next graphic in case you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=186.72s)]
*  weren't able to get a good look at that chart that he was holding up during his speech. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=191.44s)]
*  And so this gives you a sense of what the numbers are likely to look like should these [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=196.24s)]
*  tariffs be implemented. And these would go into effect on April 9th. So Switzerland's at 31%, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=201.84s)]
*  Indonesia and Taiwan at 32%, China at 34%, Vietnam at 46%, Japan at 20% and Cambodia at 49%. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=208.08s)]
*  Now again, these tariffs would go into effect on April 9th. But there are more tariffs from [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=218.88s)]
*  where that came from. Because what Trump also wants to move forward with is this baseline [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=225.12s)]
*  tariff on all imports to the United States. So the United States will implement this universal [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=231.6s)]
*  10% tariff on all products imported to the US, which would go into effect on April 5th. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  So the higher tariffs on the so-called bad actors would go into effect on April 9th. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=245.44s)]
*  The baseline tariffs on all imports to the United States would go into effect on April 5th. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=250.0s)]
*  And that would, by the way, come on top of other specific tariffs. So remember, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=255.84s)]
*  there are some tariffs that Trump has already implemented. They've already gone into effect, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=260.64s)]
*  including the 25% tariffs on all steel that's imported into the United States. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=265.28s)]
*  So when we talk about Trump's tariffs, oftentimes we talk about how he uses the threat of tariffs [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=270.8s)]
*  as a tool, as a negotiating tactic. But in fact, there have been some pretty steep tariffs on very [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=277.2s)]
*  specific items that have already gone into effect. And you can tell that Trump has been pretty [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  serious about it. And steel happens to be one of those tariffs, again, at 25%. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=288.24s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about what Trump is saying in regard to his intention here, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=293.6s)]
*  at least what the cover story is. He claims that this is really about fairness and it's about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=300.16s)]
*  bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. Let's take a look. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=305.12s)]
*  The United States charges other countries only a 2.4 tariff on motorcycles. Meanwhile, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=308.32s)]
*  Thailand and others are charging much higher prices like 60%. India charges 70%. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=317.84s)]
*  Vietnam charges 75% and others are even higher than that. Likewise, until today, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=325.6s)]
*  the United States has for decades charged a 2.5 tariff. Think of that, 2.5% [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=331.76s)]
*  on foreign-made automobiles. The European Union charges us more than 10% tariffs and they have [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=339.68s)]
*  20% VATS, much, much higher. Canada, by the way, imposes a 250 to 300% tariff on many of our dairy [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=347.92s)]
*  products. They do the first can of milk, they do the first little carton of milk at a very low [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=356.88s)]
*  price, but after that it gets bad and then it gets up to 275, 300%. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=364.08s)]
*  And China charges American rice farmers an over quota, it's called, a tariff rate of 65%. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=369.36s)]
*  South Korea charges 50, actually, they charge different from 50% to 513%. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=375.92s)]
*  And Japan, our friend, charges a 700%. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=383.92s)]
*  Okay, so look, it is true that many companies are, I should say many countries, are hitting us with [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=387.44s)]
*  much higher tariffs than we are charging companies from their countries as they import products into [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  the United States. But let's also be real, America has some pretty big tariffs on other countries as [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=404.56s)]
*  well, even before this announcement from Donald Trump. So the US has high tariffs on certain [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=410.88s)]
*  products as well, like sugar, footwear, apparel, and peanuts, a legacy of efforts to protect those [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=415.36s)]
*  industries. The US charges 350% tariffs on tobacco from many countries, 260% tariffs on Irish butter, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=421.6s)]
*  that's interesting, substitutes, and 197% tariffs on Chinese stainless steel kitchenware. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=431.28s)]
*  And look, guys, I'm actually okay with the reciprocal tariffs because understand what's [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=438.24s)]
*  happening here, understand the actual unfairness of the situation. So basically, we have a situation [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=444.08s)]
*  where we will import products that are manufactured and made in other countries. In many cases, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=451.68s)]
*  there had been a free trade situation going on where we would import them without any tariffs [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=458.24s)]
*  at all or incredibly low tariffs. Whereas the country that we are trading with [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=463.2s)]
*  would implement incredibly high tariffs on US-made products or US agriculture that's being [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=468.8s)]
*  imported into their country. Now, why would they do that? Obviously, that is a protectionist policy [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=475.44s)]
*  in order to encourage consumers in their countries to not buy the US products because obviously, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=481.76s)]
*  the US products are going to be more expensive as a result of the higher tariffs. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=488.8s)]
*  It's meant to incentivize purchasing products that are either grown or made in their home countries. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=493.12s)]
*  And so we had a policy, this lopsided policy with some countries, with some trade deals, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=500.32s)]
*  where we were just importing cheaply made goods into the US, decimating American jobs, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  the American workers that could have been making those products here in the US. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=514.48s)]
*  At the same time, our companies didn't benefit as much because obviously, the products that were [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  being imported to those trade partners, those countries, were being hit with those high tariffs, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=524.96s)]
*  disincentivizing their consumers from buying those American-made or American-grown products. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=531.12s)]
*  So I understand the unfairness of it, which is why I'm definitely open-minded to some of the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=536.32s)]
*  reciprocal tariffs that Trump is talking about here. At the same time, though, what I'm kind [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=540.96s)]
*  of curious about is how he has arrived at some of these numbers because he's got this baseline 10% [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=546.8000000000001s)]
*  tariff. Then on top of that, he's adding additional tariffs to our trade partners, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  depending on whether or not he considers them good faith or bad faith. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=559.12s)]
*  If he considers them good faith trade partners, he does this discount, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=562.64s)]
*  reciprocal tariff, where it's the 10% baseline. And then whatever they're charging us with their [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=567.04s)]
*  tariffs, he'll take that and he'll half it by 50% and tack that number on to the 10% baseline tariff. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=572.8s)]
*  So that's the way it's being reported right now in regard to how the Trump administration [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  has reached these numbers. But long story short, this is obviously going to have a negative impact [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=585.36s)]
*  on prices. This is going to lead to inflation, which is why the markets have already responded [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=591.76s)]
*  to Trump's announcement during his speech. The S&P 500 went down 2.2%. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=598.0s)]
*  And I should also note that, just to give you an example of how lopsided some of the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=604.64s)]
*  trade policies are. So the United States only charges 2.5% for European cars, but it charges [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=610.16s)]
*  25% or a 25% tariff on foreign trucks. Now, why do they do that? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, we charge the 25% tariff on foreign-made trucks because we want to incentivize American [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=621.68s)]
*  consumers to buy American-made trucks. And so other countries do the same thing and Trump is [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=627.5999999999999s)]
*  trying to, I guess, renegotiate things to give the United States and American companies a bigger [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  advantage in this world market, this world trade situation. So I should also note that in regard [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=639.68s)]
*  to the auto tariffs, which are gonna go into effect midnight, those are 25% tariffs on foreign-made [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=646.4s)]
*  vehicles that are being imported to the United States. He is gonna go through with that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=653.36s)]
*  However, those tariffs would impact foreign-made parts that are used to manufacture cars [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=657.76s)]
*  domestically. And so what Trump is saying is, if the parts are coming from either Canada or Mexico, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=664.16s)]
*  and most of the parts do come from those two countries, I'm going to exempt tariffs on those [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=670.4s)]
*  foreign-made parts if it falls under the USMCA bill that he had negotiated. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=675.2800000000001s)]
*  That was the renegotiation of NAFTA. I know this is a lot of information, but [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  this is what's going on right now with his move on tariffs, and it's gonna have a huge [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  impact on the economy. So per Jeff Stein over at the Washington Post, for a developed country, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=692.72s)]
*  America is largely in the middle of the pack. So on a trade-weighted basis, the average US [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=698.72s)]
*  tariff is 2.2%, Japan is 1.9%, and the European Union is 2.7%, slightly higher than the US average, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  according to the World Trade Organization. So that's kind of a look at what trade policy is [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=714.48s)]
*  globally on average. And last night, perhaps in an effort, this is my favorite part of the story, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=720.1600000000001s)]
*  perhaps in an effort to kind of get ahead of Trump's announcement on reciprocal tariffs. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=726.56s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the following. Let's take a quick [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  look at this. Today, we canceled all of the customs duties levied on products from the [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=735.52s)]
*  United States, Israel's largest trading partner. Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=743.68s)]
*  minute. First of all, we weren't charging tariffs on Israeli-made products that were being imported [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=751.52s)]
*  to the United States. Let me be clear about that. But Israel was charging American goods [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=756.0s)]
*  or hitting American goods with tariffs. And he's like, am I not merciful? I'm now repealing them [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=761.28s)]
*  the night before Trump is gonna make an announcement about reciprocal tariffs. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=767.84s)]
*  But think about how much Israel benefits from American taxpayers on a regular basis, whether [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=771.6s)]
*  they're in war or not in war, okay? We're sending them billion dollars a year when they're not at [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=777.6s)]
*  war, just on a regular basis, a yearly basis. And then obviously, we've been sending them tens of [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=784.48s)]
*  billions of dollars recently as a result of their assault on Gaza and their attempt at [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=790.88s)]
*  essentially, ethically cleansing that area and taking the land. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=796.64s)]
*  And on top of that, we're paying for their weapons, we're paying for their weapons. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=801.2s)]
*  On top of that, they were hitting American-made products with high tariffs. It's amazing. So he [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=805.6s)]
*  says he's canceling the customs duties on American goods. It's an additional step [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=810.8s)]
*  in the policy that my government have led for a decade in opening up the market to competition, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=816.88s)]
*  introducing variety to the economy and lowering the cost of living. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=824.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, long story short, they had tariffs on US-made products. But according [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=827.5999999999999s)]
*  to the Trump administration's tariff chart, all of a sudden, Israel is about to get hit with a 17% [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=832.56s)]
*  tariff anyway. And that 17% tariff would be tacked on to the 10% baseline tariff. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=838.72s)]
*  So Israeli-made products could be hit with a 27% tariff pretty soon. Something tells me that that [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=845.52s)]
*  won't go into effect. We'll wait and see, but that's my prediction. Now, I wanna talk a little bit [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=851.9200000000001s)]
*  about what corporate executives were up to in February, because it turns out that they [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=858.4s)]
*  met with Trump administration officials in an attempt to get ahead of the announcement [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=863.2s)]
*  of his tariffs, probably to persuade him against doing it. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=868.6400000000001s)]
*  And I think the story is so fascinating. They didn't wanna attack Trump publicly, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  they're terrified of him. So they're like, maybe we can talk to some cabinet officials. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  Maybe they'll look out for us, little conversation. So included were executives like Amazon founder [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  Jeff Bezos, Pfizer CEO Albert Borla, NASDAQ CEO, Adina Friedman, and Target CEO Brian Cornell. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=890.08s)]
*  So according to the report here, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick rebuked the group, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=899.9200000000001s)]
*  telling the executives they should wake up every morning thinking about how they can support the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=906.08s)]
*  country. Two of the people familiar with the conversation said, and he made clear that Trump [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=911.2s)]
*  would forge ahead with plans to transform the global economy. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=917.76s)]
*  And that he did. I mean, he made his announcement today. It didn't seem like the Trump [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=922.56s)]
*  administration was at all deterred by anything these corporate executives had to say in regard [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=926.4s)]
*  to the tariffs. And Trump really does seem to wanna go through with this. Apple CEO Tim Cook, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=931.12s)]
*  though, tried to promise some goodies to Trump in an effort to get Trump to be easy on the company. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=937.36s)]
*  So he received an exemption from tariffs Trump imposed on China during his first term. And he [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=944.4000000000001s)]
*  met with the president in February. Afterward, Apple said it would spend $500 billion in the [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=950.8000000000001s)]
*  United States over the next four years, though much of that investment was already planned. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=956.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you see this happening with our trade partners as well, where Trump will threaten them [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  with steep tariffs. And then they'll come to him and say, we promised to do this, or we promised [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=966.88s)]
*  to do that. And it turns out that they're promising to do things that they were either [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=971.36s)]
*  already doing or had already committed to doing at the tail end of the Biden administration. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  But in this case, Tim Cook didn't get off easy because obviously Apple is gonna be hit with that [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=980.88s)]
*  10% baseline tariff on all products that are manufactured in other countries. Now, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=987.52s)]
*  do I think for a second that this is really about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=993.84s)]
*  United States? I don't, I'm skeptical about it, I really am. Do I think that this is an effort to [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=999.36s)]
*  renegotiate trade deals? Maybe, that's a possibility. But what I think this is really about, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1005.6800000000001s)]
*  it's two things. Our stock market is inflated, has been inflated for a long time. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1011.76s)]
*  It's difficult for rich people to know where to park their money, where to invest, when the value [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1019.12s)]
*  of shares is already super high, they're looking for a discount. So if you're an investor, right now [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1026.0s)]
*  is the time to buy, isn't it? The stock market is down, it went down 2.2% as Trump was speaking [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1031.36s)]
*  today. So I feel like there's some manipulation going on, we'll see. But the other thing that [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1038.0s)]
*  Trump mentioned during his speech, and it wasn't lost on me, was his tax policy. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1045.28s)]
*  The next agenda item for the Trump administration is to lower taxes further. It's a $4.5 trillion [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1051.44s)]
*  tax bill. It's gonna cost our country $4.5 trillion. So they did all the tricky-pizzicky stuff [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1060.0s)]
*  where they're pretending like they're cutting all sorts of waste in the federal government. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1066.08s)]
*  And obviously, that was meant to garner support for his attempt to cut taxes for [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1070.32s)]
*  mostly the rich and corporations. Let's keep it real. He will extend the taxes or the tax breaks [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1076.0s)]
*  for ordinary working class people, but make no mistake about it. Those who stand to benefit the [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1081.52s)]
*  most are the wealthiest among us. And that is the reason why the tax bill that he is proposing is [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1086.64s)]
*  not popular with the American public. But if you're dealing with incredibly high prices, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1093.76s)]
*  so much of our food is actually imported from other countries. So much of our produce is [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1099.76s)]
*  imported from other countries. If American workers, ordinary Americans, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1105.04s)]
*  are being crushed with inflation and they need some relief, a tax break or an extension of the [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1108.72s)]
*  tax break that they're currently enjoying, I guess, is gonna become a lot more popular. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1114.96s)]
*  There's gonna be a lot more pressure for Americans to support what Trump is trying to do with his tax [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1121.36s)]
*  bill. That could be part of Trump's agenda here as well. I don't know. What I do know for a fact is [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1127.12s)]
*  that there's going to be a lot of pain, even if he's being serious about wanting to bring [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1134.48s)]
*  manufacturing jobs back to the United States. That's gonna take a long time. It's gonna take [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1139.28s)]
*  at least a year. I mean, you have to figure out if these companies are going to wanna invest in [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1144.8s)]
*  the United States. They're gonna have to deal with their shareholders. They're gonna have to [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1150.48s)]
*  deal with their board. Remember shareholders and the board, they famously don't want to invest more [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1153.3600000000001s)]
*  money into the company. What they want more than anything is to get a return on their investment. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1158.32s)]
*  So there's gonna be that process. Then there's the process of actually building [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1163.52s)]
*  the manufacturing plants in order to manufacture vehicles and everything that [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1168.48s)]
*  is getting hit with these high tariffs. And then you gotta hire workers. It's gonna take some time. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1172.56s)]
*  So even if you believe what Trump is saying about wanting fairness in world trade, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1177.76s)]
*  wanting to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1183.36s)]
*  you're still gonna have some pain in the short term for at least a year before you have that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1187.0400000000002s)]
*  investment in the US and you have some of these jobs come up. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1194.3200000000002s)]
*  But even then, American workers get paid higher wages than the workers in foreign countries do. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1198.48s)]
*  I mean, they're exploited for their labor. There's no question about that, but that's [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1206.0800000000002s)]
*  part of the game. That's what keeps the prices for these products down. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1209.6000000000001s)]
*  So we'll see what happens, but this announcement was wide ranging. It was specific, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1212.56s)]
*  and these tariffs are definitely steep and it impacts literally everything that's imported [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1219.6799999999998s)]
*  into the United States. I'll leave you with this though. There was a little bit of wiggle room in [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1224.6399999999999s)]
*  what Trump had to say, indicating that he's willing to negotiate some of these tariffs. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1230.72s)]
*  So do I think that what he announced today will be the end result of what these tariffs will be? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  Probably not, but we're gonna have to wait and see. And honestly, with this administration so [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1242.24s)]
*  far, there's a lot of waiting and there's a lot of seeing. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16_zk_AEYro&t=1246.88s)]
