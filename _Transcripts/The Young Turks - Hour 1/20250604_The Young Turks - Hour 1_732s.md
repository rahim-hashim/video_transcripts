"The White House has contracted Palantir, a Colorado-based analytics company co-founded by Trump supporter Peter Thiel, to assist in compiling a database of personal information on American citizens, according to unnamed government officials and Palantir employees who spoke with The New York Times. The purported deal follows project talks Palantir had with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Education."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Is this the REAL police state?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0)
*  Something that has preserved our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=0.0s)]
*  civil liberties for a long time has [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=2.1s)]
*  been just the pragmatic fact that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=4.32s)]
*  as much information as agencies [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=6.28s)]
*  collect, it was never feasible for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=8.16s)]
*  them to be able to go through it [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=10.26s)]
*  all. AI now is making it possible [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=12.06s)]
*  to do that to triage these huge [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=14.24s)]
*  amounts of data that are being [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=16.28s)]
*  siphoned up. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's not just possible to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=19.22s)]
*  sift through all of that data that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=22.22s)]
*  gets gathered about ordinary [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=25.36s)]
*  American citizens on a regular [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=28.26s)]
*  basis, because now the Trump [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  administration is actively doing it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=33.300000000000004s)]
*  with the help of Palantir, which [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=36.34s)]
*  of course is a data analysis firm [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=39.02s)]
*  that has ties to both Elon Musk and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Peter Thiel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=44.18s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=46.34s)]
*  Now some folks in the MAGA [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=47.42s)]
*  movement, the America First crowd [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  are absolutely furious about this [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  while others aren't so concerned. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=53.06s)]
*  We're going to get to all of them [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=55.06s)]
*  in just a moment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  First, here are some details about [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=57.46s)]
*  what's going on here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=59.5s)]
*  So in March of this year, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=60.76s)]
*  President Donald Trump signed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=62.44s)]
*  the following executive order, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=64.48s)]
*  stopping waste, fraud, and abuse [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=66.74s)]
*  by eliminating information silos. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=69.02s)]
*  So the purpose of that order was [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=71.58s)]
*  essentially to facilitate what [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=73.62s)]
*  Ken Klippenstein was talking about [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=75.66s)]
*  or warning about in that clip that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=77.9s)]
*  we just showed you, surveilling and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=80.02s)]
*  consolidating the data of every [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=82.26s)]
*  single federal agency or [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=84.3s)]
*  the data about us that exists in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  every single federal agency. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  And so last month, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  the New York Times reported that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=90.96s)]
*  the Trump administration chose [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=92.8s)]
*  Palantir to help them with this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=94.8s)]
*  effort. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=96.8s)]
*  So we mentioned the company's ties [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=97.88s)]
*  to Elon Musk earlier and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=99.92s)]
*  that is relevant because Palantir [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=101.36s)]
*  selection as a chief vendor for [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=103.36s)]
*  the project was driven by Elon [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=105.28s)]
*  Musk's Department of Government [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=107.28s)]
*  Efficiency according to six [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=109.52s)]
*  anonymous government officials. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=111.44s)]
*  At least three Doge members [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=113.84s)]
*  formally worked at Palantir, while [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=115.8s)]
*  two others had worked at companies [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=118.36s)]
*  funded by Peter Thiel, an investor [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=120.72s)]
*  and a founder of Palantir. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=123.24s)]
*  Now for the sake of being the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  fairest show in America and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=127.38s)]
*  also to just dispel the notion that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=129.44s)]
*  Democrats are so [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  much better than Republicans when [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=133.38s)]
*  it comes to these types of issues. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=135.92s)]
*  Turns out that the Biden [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=138.48s)]
*  administration also partnered with [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=139.96s)]
*  Palantir basically to help them [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=142.44000000000003s)]
*  facilitate the rollout of the COVID [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  vaccines, which I actually was [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=146.72000000000003s)]
*  unaware of until today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  Now according to the Times, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  Palantir has a product called [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=152.4s)]
*  Foundry that organizes and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=154.44000000000003s)]
*  analyzes data that's been collected. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=156.4s)]
*  And so Foundry has already been [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=159.52s)]
*  implemented in four separate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  federal government agencies. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=163.52s)]
*  And that's according to this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=166.24s)]
*  report. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=167.36s)]
*  So here are some examples of the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=167.86s)]
*  kind of work that Palantir is doing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=169.36s)]
*  just so you have a sense of how [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=171.12s)]
*  much more terrifying our [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  surveillance state and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=174.36s)]
*  police state is about to be. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=175.88s)]
*  So Palantir recently began helping [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=178.04s)]
*  Immigration and Customs Enforcement [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=180.04s)]
*  and Removal Operations Team, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=182.32s)]
*  according to two Palantir employees [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=184.32s)]
*  and two current and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  former DHS officials. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=187.96s)]
*  The work is part of a $30 million [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=190.16s)]
*  contract that ICE signed with [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Palantir in April to build a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=194.72s)]
*  platform to track migrant movements [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=196.72s)]
*  in real time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=199.32s)]
*  Now Palantir representatives have [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=200.72s)]
*  also had talks with the Social [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=202.52s)]
*  Security Administration and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=204.12s)]
*  the Department of Education to use [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=205.88s)]
*  the company's technology to organize [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=207.88s)]
*  the agency's data according to two [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=210.2s)]
*  Palantir employees and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  officials in those agencies. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=213.98s)]
*  And we know that the federal [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=215.92s)]
*  government is willing to infringe [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=217.96s)]
*  on the rights of Americans and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=220.64s)]
*  people who are here in the country [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=222.92s)]
*  legally with green cards, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  with student visas. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=227.4s)]
*  If we dare offend the sensitivities [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=229.52s)]
*  of the wonderful government of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=231.52s)]
*  Israel that's currently carrying [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  out a genocide in Gaza right now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  So there is some concern among [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=236.52s)]
*  people on the left, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=238.52s)]
*  I share this concern that, well, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  there could be a massive collection [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  of blackmail on Americans who dare [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=245.52s)]
*  speak out against Israel and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm worried about that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=250.36s)]
*  I'm genuinely worried about that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  So we're going to get to turmoil [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  within the MAGA movement over this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=256.92s)]
*  in just a minute, but Cenk, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=258.76s)]
*  I want to get your initial thoughts. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=259.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm going to give you [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=261.12s)]
*  more details of how other companies [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  are now trying to track our social [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=264.8s)]
*  media as well to make a database of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=266.8s)]
*  people who are having unacceptable [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  thoughts. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=271.28s)]
*  These are, of course, from [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=273.08s)]
*  the party of people who said that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=274.68s)]
*  they were for freedom of speech and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=276.56s)]
*  they were against cancel culture, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=278.64s)]
*  and they were against big [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  government. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=282.2s)]
*  So what is this? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=282.92s)]
*  This is definitely big government, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=284.64s)]
*  you can't argue that it's not. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=286.92s)]
*  Here, let me pause to just [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  emphasize this. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=291.44s)]
*  They would collect your social [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=293.88s)]
*  security number, your bank [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=295.64s)]
*  accounts, and your medical [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=297.3s)]
*  information in the same place. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=298.96s)]
*  So if there's any way to know [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=302.24s)]
*  anything damaging about you, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=303.8s)]
*  you just have to look at one [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=305.64s)]
*  convenient place. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=307.04s)]
*  These are medical problems, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=308.36s)]
*  they're a banking issue. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=310.24s)]
*  Can we stop something that going [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=312.24s)]
*  into their bank accounts? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=314.12s)]
*  Can we stop their social security? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=316.24s)]
*  How are the different ways that we [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  can target an American citizen? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=319.68s)]
*  Okay? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=321.76s)]
*  You got to buy that double [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  donger in cash, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=323.2s)]
*  don't use your debit card. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=323.88s)]
*  No, now they'll know, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=325.2s)]
*  Big Brother will know. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so big government, big [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=327.6s)]
*  brother, I would argue potentially [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=330.24s)]
*  tyrannical government and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=333.32s)]
*  the deep state. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  How is that for deeply ironic? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=337.64s)]
*  And this is the Trump [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=341.76s)]
*  administration, and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=342.68s)]
*  what do we tell you guys? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=343.76s)]
*  They're going to do what [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=345.12s)]
*  their donors want. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=345.96s)]
*  Palantir is a massive donor. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=347.04s)]
*  Peter Thiel is a massive donor, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=349.8s)]
*  obviously Elon Musk. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=351.44s)]
*  But on top of that, remember, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=352.52s)]
*  JD Vance's entire career was wholly [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  invented by Peter Thiel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=357.76s)]
*  He was nowhere to be found in any [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=360.32s)]
*  polling, Peter Thiel gave him $10 [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=362.16s)]
*  million, he started running in Ohio, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=364.36s)]
*  and that's how the JD Vance robot [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  was launched into the world. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=369.2s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=371.24s)]
*  Now look, there are some in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  the MAGA crowd who are upset about [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=375.8s)]
*  this, and I'm happy to see it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=377.6s)]
*  Lot of backlash among ordinary [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  people on social media, so [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  if you're on X, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=384.16s)]
*  you'll probably notice it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=385.16s)]
*  Let's talk about some of the more, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=387.24s)]
*  I guess, prominent people on [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=388.8s)]
*  the right, people like Nick Fuentes, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=390.24s)]
*  who's, to be fair, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=392.24s)]
*  he's been furious with Trump in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=393.44s)]
*  the past. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=395.16s)]
*  He's been willing to criticize [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=395.76s)]
*  Trump, so it doesn't surprise me [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=397.24s)]
*  that he would criticize Trump over [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=398.8s)]
*  this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=400.36s)]
*  He writes Trump's promotion of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=401.12s)]
*  Palantir is the ultimate betrayal [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=402.72s)]
*  of his own people, feeding every [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=404.52s)]
*  MAGA extremists into an AI database [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=406.24s)]
*  controlled by CIA, Mossad cutout. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=408.32s)]
*  Seriously, if Palantir isn't [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=410.48s)]
*  the deep state, then what is? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=413.32s)]
*  By the way, who leaked [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=417.08s)]
*  Glenn Greenwald's tape? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=419.92s)]
*  Just asking questions. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=424.04s)]
*  Nick Fuentes also says, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=425.68s)]
*  never forget that JD Vance owes [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=427.08s)]
*  his entire existence to Palantir [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=428.88s)]
*  co-founder Peter Thiel. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=430.76s)]
*  And that is why every Thiel-funded [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=432.48s)]
*  shill on this site is constantly [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  glazing him and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=436.56s)]
*  astroturfing support for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=437.52s)]
*  a presidential run in 2028. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=439.36s)]
*  Now, let's move over to Alex Jones, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=442.0s)]
*  who is now a shell of what he used [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=444.32s)]
*  to be, because if anyone was [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=446.28s)]
*  vociferously speaking out against [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=448.24s)]
*  the police state, the surveillance [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=450.44s)]
*  state, the deep state, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=452.76s)]
*  it was Alex Jones. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  But now he's being a good little [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=456.2s)]
*  boy, kind of going along with [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=457.44s)]
*  what's happening here. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=458.56s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=459.68s)]
*  Palantir and the surveillance [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  systems and the AI and all of it [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=464.12s)]
*  has been an outlier from [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=466.84s)]
*  the bigger companies. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's been wanting to get big [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=471.68s)]
*  contracts, and Trump wants to use [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=473.64s)]
*  it to track illegal aliens and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  stuff and the real ID that they're [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=477.2s)]
*  trying to bring in that's terrible, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=479.08s)]
*  that never got implemented because [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=481.24s)]
*  it's unconstitutional. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=483.2s)]
*  So I've been critical of all of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=484.48s)]
*  that, and I obviously don't trust [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=485.52s)]
*  Palantir and the rest of stuff it's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=486.76s)]
*  doing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=488.12s)]
*  But it is small compared to all [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  the other big AI and the Pentagon, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  Sentinel and all the rest of it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=493.52s)]
*  The reason you're seeing the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=496.0s)]
*  attacks on it everywhere is because [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  it's trying to get contracts that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=500.4s)]
*  other big tech companies already [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=502.84s)]
*  have and because Palantir has been [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=505.24s)]
*  supportive of Trump. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=507.8s)]
*  And so yeah, Trump is going to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=509.64s)]
*  them because they've been [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=511.76s)]
*  supporters. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=513.72s)]
*  But all this hype about Palantir, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=514.6s)]
*  all of these systems can be used [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=517.0s)]
*  for control. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=519.2800000000001s)]
*  All these systems are out of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=520.88s)]
*  control, all the AIs are woke. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=522.2800000000001s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=528.64s)]
*  Well, that was the most pathetic [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=531.32s)]
*  defense of a surveillance program [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=534.1600000000001s)]

*  Jones, what kind of nasty stuff [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=544.76s)]
*  have you gotten into? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=546.56s)]
*  What kind of blackmail does Peter [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=547.88s)]

*  That's what I want to know. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=550.0s)]
*  To the point where you are willing [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=551.0s)]
*  to provide cover for this? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=553.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=555.3599999999999s)]
*  What do you think, Cenk? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  So we're not quoting Fuentes and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=557.3199999999999s)]
*  Alex Jones here as legitimate [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=559.0799999999999s)]
*  sources, we're just telling you [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=560.8s)]
*  what the right wing is doing, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=562.4799999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=563.76s)]
*  And Fuentes is part of [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=564.28s)]
*  the right wing and obviously, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=565.5999999999999s)]
*  that's why he gets into this story. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=567.4799999999999s)]
*  And then Alex Jones is interesting [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  because he's the guy who's been [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=572.56s)]
*  telling us for the last 10, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=574.4799999999999s)]
*  20 years, like, you got to watch [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=576.16s)]
*  our government, they're going to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=577.76s)]
*  collect all of your information in [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=579.4s)]
*  one place and they're going to be [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=581.04s)]
*  able to blackmail you and they're [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=582.6s)]
*  going to make governments going to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=584.4s)]
*  be too radical, too radical, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=586.24s)]
*  I tell you. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=587.7199999999999s)]
*  Now all of a sudden Palantir and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=588.4s)]
*  Peter Teal are doing it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=590.0s)]
*  I don't know where does the money [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  come from, anything, I don't know, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=592.8399999999999s)]
*  but Peter Teal finances a ton of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=594.76s)]
*  right wing politicians and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=596.36s)]
*  right wing media, right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=597.8s)]
*  So then all of a sudden, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=599.24s)]
*  Alex Jones is like, well, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=600.36s)]
*  Palantir, it's pretty good. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=601.56s)]
*  You collect all the information in [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=602.88s)]
*  one place so you can just blackmail [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=604.36s)]
*  them and this is their criticizing [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=605.88s)]
*  Israeli, that's when you get them, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=607.48s)]
*  right? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=609.24s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=609.84s)]
*  What happened? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=610.64s)]
*  So what you saw there? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=611.36s)]
*  No, it's amazing. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=613.76s)]
*  But by the way, by the way, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=614.8s)]
*  I mean, really, it's woke to attack [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=617.36s)]
*  Palantir for wanting a more robust [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=620.72s)]
*  surveillance state that negatively [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=623.76s)]
*  impacts America, it's woke. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=626.88s)]
*  It's woke to be against that. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=629.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=631.16s)]
*  Look, I mean, so much of what he [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=632.76s)]
*  says is so absurd. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=634.68s)]
*  I think he said the AI is woke. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=637.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, super woke, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=641.88s)]
*  nothing more woke than AI. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=642.88s)]
*  They said the frogs are gay and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=645.36s)]
*  the AI is woke, but [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=647.08s)]
*  don't worry if big government is [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=648.1999999999999s)]
*  tracking all of your movements. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=650.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=652.4s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=652.92s)]
*  So there's one more thing, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=654.96s)]
*  Aaron Cohen is apparently some sort [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=657.04s)]
*  of Israeli special forces veteran. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=659.84s)]
*  And he was on Fox News the other [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=663.6s)]
*  night with Sean Hannity. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=665.4s)]
*  And he said, don't worry that he [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=666.84s)]
*  has something that's AI powered, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=669.08s)]
*  that is a threat detection system [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=671.64s)]
*  for radicalization in social media. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=674.28s)]
*  So if you're writing anything that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=677.36s)]
*  he says is pro Hamas, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=679.76s)]
*  which means criticizing Israel, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=681.36s)]
*  they're going to track you and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=683.76s)]
*  they're going to put it into [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=685.76s)]
*  a database and make sure that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=687.44s)]
*  the American government punishes [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=689.1600000000001s)]
*  you. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=691.36s)]
*  And then he adds on top, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=692.1800000000001s)]
*  it's Israeli model means that [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=694.1800000000001s)]
*  Palantir quality engineering. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=696.82s)]
*  So don't worry everybody, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=700.66s)]
*  it's an Israeli model and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=702.1800000000001s)]
*  it's just like Palantir. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=703.54s)]
*  But on top of tracking all of your [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=704.94s)]
*  personal information, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=706.94s)]
*  it also tracks social media for [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=708.54s)]
*  any unacceptable opinions, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=710.46s)]
*  which will soon be illegal if you [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=712.34s)]
*  say about a foreign government. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=714.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so good thing Big Brother's [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=717.14s)]
*  not here. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=719.4200000000001s)]
*  Glad some portion of right wing are [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=722.22s)]
*  rebelling. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUx94fLsl0&t=724.3000000000001s)]
