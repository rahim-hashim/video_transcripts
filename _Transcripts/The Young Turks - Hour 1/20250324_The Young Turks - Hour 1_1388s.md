Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# David Pakman on His New Book 'The Echo Machine' & How The Dems Can Combat Trump
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk)
*  Joining me now is David Pakman, of course, host of the David Pakman show. And now the author of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=0.0s)]
*  the Echo Machine, How Right-Wing Extremism Created a Post-Truth America. David, welcome, brother. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=5.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=10.96s)]
*  No problem. So tell me about the right-wing echo machine. I know it's been around a long time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=12.8s)]
*  Is it this, and as you're doing that, is it the same as it's always been or is it a little bit [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=17.84s)]
*  different now? It's different. The story I tell basically goes back to the late 50s. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=22.64s)]
*  And Trumpism as a sort of consequence stemmed from the opposition to the civil rights movement [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=28.08s)]
*  that started around 58, of course, opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It went through Reagan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  It went through Gingrich taking over the House in 94. Bush opposition to Obama. And so in the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=42.0s)]
*  context of the book, this is an echo machine that's been built kind of alongside the last [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=48.8s)]
*  60 years of right-wing ideology. It involves media. It involves elected officials. It involves focus [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=53.76s)]
*  groups and consultants and all of that stuff. But it really sees Trump more as a consequence [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=59.68s)]
*  rather than as the cause of a lot of this stuff. But yet Trump has had a complicated relationship [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  with the 800-pound gorilla in right-wing media, which is Fox News. They helped to build them up, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=72.16s)]
*  and then there was conflict between the two. And how did that get resolved? I mean, was it [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=78.56s)]
*  like back in the old days, let me put it this way, David. You knew Fox News and George W. Bush and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=85.2s)]
*  Dick Cheney were on the same page. They were putting out the same message and there was never [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  any variance, right? But with Trump, it's different than that. So tell me about that relationship real [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=93.04s)]
*  quick. It is different. If you look at the micro, of course, in 2016, Fox was pretty late to coming [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=99.2s)]
*  around to this is going to be the nominee and we should get behind them. It looked like there was [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=105.36s)]
*  skepticism from Fox about Trump being the nominee, not so much in 2020, but certainly in 2024. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=109.52s)]
*  But I know we're going to talk about what happens on the Democratic side. One of the things that I [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=115.68s)]
*  explained in the book is that the echo machine of the right has been really good for them in terms [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=120.72s)]
*  of seizing power, which at the end of the day is really what matters. Politics is about power. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=126.56s)]
*  Whereas the echo machine for Democrats has been more destructive. And that's kind of how I would [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=131.44s)]
*  characterize the relationship with Fox News, which is yes, there have been back and forth. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=136.72s)]
*  You would occasionally hear sort of nominal voices of reason or questions about the way Trump [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=141.2s)]
*  perceived that he should run the country and run as a candidate. But the big picture is that the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=147.68s)]
*  entire machine has been useful to the right for seizing power and it's been destructive for the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=152.88s)]
*  left. Yeah, so I want to get to the left in a second. But now we have a much more complicated [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=157.36s)]
*  media ecosystem in my opinion, because in the old days it was just Fox News and Rush Limbaugh [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=164.08s)]
*  and talk radio and they just again, they print out talking points and no one would vary. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  Now you've got the brosphere, the Rogans, the Theo Vons, etc. that are a little bit different. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  You've got online folks, Patrick, but David, Tim Pool, all these guys. And they're not all [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=179.36s)]
*  on the same message. They disagree in parts and then of course, they agree on the major issues. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=184.8s)]
*  So how has that affected the echo machine? Well, here's the thing. What that sort of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=192.0s)]
*  dissent or veneer of dissent has done is it has played really well for something you and I have [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  talked about before. Which is that if you're nominally on the left or you've supported [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=204.96s)]
*  Democrats or whatever and you find some issue where maybe you're kind of unsure or you're not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=209.52s)]
*  on the same page on some issue, they welcome you. And the great thing about those variances in that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=215.68s)]
*  right wing echo machine is that at the end of the day, they really do all support Trump and helped [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=221.36s)]
*  his reelection. But you can find a place where you will immediately be welcomed as someone who [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=227.52s)]
*  starts questioning and saying, I don't know, I think Trump's not good. But here's an issue [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=233.52s)]
*  I have with Democrats or I don't like this. The left has done the opposite and to the extent that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=238.72s)]
*  the echo machine exists on our side, it's been exclusionary rather than inclusionary. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=243.92s)]
*  So you're right that there's this diversity of opinion, at least nominally. But at the end of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=250.0s)]
*  the day, Tim Pool supported Trump, PBD supported Trump, Fox News came around to Trump. Yes, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=255.36s)]
*  different flavors and versions, but in total, they're supporting what is the ultimate goal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=260.56s)]
*  Right, until you get the actual policy, right? Because- [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=266.79999999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=269.84s)]
*  And that's where I don't think we have the answer yet because we have not had a giant clash. We had a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=270.56s)]
*  small clash over when Trump said we're gonna put boots on the ground in Gaza and the right wingers [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=276.56s)]
*  online were like, hell no. And then he went back on that within 24 hours. But we do have a giant [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=282.64s)]
*  conflict between Fox News and most of the online right wing. Because the online right wing is [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=290.55999999999995s)]
*  anti-war or at least they've said a billion times that they're anti-war. Fox News is pro-war. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=295.76s)]
*  So what do they do when there's an actual policy on the line, war or not war? What's your sense of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  it? My sense is that loyalty is the ultimate test and so far it hasn't fallen. And this sort of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=307.2s)]
*  feels like a continuation to the conversation you and I had on my show where with total peace [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=312.56s)]
*  and love and respect, I told you that I thought some of your expectations were a little naive. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=316.88s)]
*  We've sort of now heard directly from Trump on the cutting defense spending. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=320.88s)]
*  He said, I'm just not gonna do it. I'm not cutting defense spending period. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=325.36s)]
*  On being the anti-war president, launching new initiatives against the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=328.88s)]
*  Look at what's happening in Russia, Ukraine. It was gonna be day one of the transition period, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  then day one of the presidency. Now it's maybe the first 100 days, maybe not. The Gaza stuff, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=338.0s)]
*  as you're pointing out. At the end of the day, I'm not seeing any serious movement in that right [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=342.48s)]
*  wing echo machine that is questioning whether Trump was the right choice. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=348.64s)]
*  They'll kind of dabble around the edges about I wish that we were a little more disciplined or [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=353.2s)]
*  that a little more organized or that there wasn't as much kind of like throw stuff at the wall on [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=357.36s)]
*  tariffs and see what sticks. But ultimately, loyalty is really the test and they're remaining [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=362.32s)]
*  loyal. Yeah, so far it's only been two months into this administration and I want to- [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=368.24s)]
*  It's been two months. Yeah, and I want to clarify one thing, David. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=372.56s)]
*  I never expected them to turn around immediately and be like, yeah, I'm against Donald Trump within [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  40 days, right? My God, I'm now a left-foot. They weren't gonna do that, of course not, right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=380.4s)]
*  And I was actually gratified to see the pushback on sending American soldiers to Gaza. That [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  actually was real and it did happen. But I think the bigger questions lay ahead, right? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=392.24s)]
*  So and I have been so far definitely disappointed in some of the reaction, like [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=398.48s)]
*  kicking out Mahmoud Khalil and just doing whatever Israel wants, the madness. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=406.72s)]
*  But on Ukraine, there's things that are surprising and things that are not surprising. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=414.48s)]
*  But on things like, and so I'll ask you about this in the right wing, then we'll finally turn [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=418.0s)]
*  to the left, is they had that thing where they were like, freedom of speech, my God, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=422.24s)]
*  cancel culture is the worst thing in the world and we're all about freedom and free speech [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=427.6s)]
*  absolutists. And now Donald Trump says, CBS, I didn't like what they said about me or how they [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  edited the Kamala Harris interview. I want $10 billion. I didn't like what this guy said about [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=439.12s)]
*  me. I want money, I want money, I want to sue them, I want to arrest them, etc. Elon Musk is now [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=443.44s)]
*  rivaling Donald Trump in how thin his skin is. He's talking about lawfare against anyone who [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  criticizes them, etc. And there I expected a little bit more pushback and I haven't seen much. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=455.68s)]
*  It seems like they're now flipping to free speech sucks and we should end it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=464.72s)]
*  That level of hypocrisy is just gigantic. Are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing on that? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=469.76s)]
*  I'm seeing the same thing and this is a hallmark if you studied the 20th century [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=474.8s)]
*  authoritarians. This is an absolute classic in terms of specifically the relationship with the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=479.92s)]
*  media, but also doing a 180 on a principle you claim to hold dear and then your followers [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=485.6s)]
*  essentially do nothing to really criticize you. This is absolutely classic and there's a chapter [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=491.12s)]
*  in the book about not getting sucked into these philosophical echo chamber, echo machine elements [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=496.48s)]
*  where I will sometimes have people call in and they'll go, David, let's talk about first [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  principles. What is your framework on ethics and foreign policy and morality? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=506.64s)]
*  And this is a classic move to kind of abstract philosophy away from making difficult policy [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  decisions. And the reason it's not worth getting sucked into those philosophical debates about [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=520.08s)]
*  their principles about free speech or government intervention is that as soon as they're [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  inconvenient, they do a 180 as you're pointing out, you know, on government intervention [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=528.08s)]
*  in business. They're against it until they want to force Twitter to publish what they believe [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=534.08s)]
*  about COVID or they're doing an infomercial for Tesla on the front lawn of the White House or [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=539.84s)]
*  none of these principles are really sincerely held. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=546.32s)]
*  And it's why I think the left would do well not to even get sucked into the black hole. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=548.96s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know what you mean exactly by getting sucked into the black hole, but I [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=553.12s)]
*  don't want anybody to be naive and think that anybody's going to turn around overnight or that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  they're going to dump Trump or Elon Musk and their love for them, etc. But I was hoping for [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=562.88s)]
*  a little bit, just not like 10, 15, 20% pushback on, hey, wait, I thought we were free speech [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=568.88s)]
*  absolutists. Now, a billionaire is going to try to sue people out of existence because they [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=576.48s)]
*  hurt his feelings. And now all of a sudden they're like, well, look, there's defamation laws. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=582.24s)]
*  There's all these laws against speech. Did you know all these laws against speech? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=586.72s)]
*  Yeah, brother, we were telling you that for years and you told us that was nonsense and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=590.88s)]
*  tyranny and oppression. Anyway, so that hypocrisy is pretty strong right now as things stand. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=594.88s)]
*  So now let's turn to the left. Okay, I mean, there's certainly an echo machine on the left, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=601.5999999999999s)]
*  and there's a couple of different echo machines if you ask me. But you've got the classic one [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=606.56s)]
*  at MSNBC, Joe Biden's Young and Dynamic, every democratic leader is God's gift to humanity. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=610.56s)]
*  They're all geniuses, the corporate Democrats should always win, the progressive will never win. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=616.88s)]
*  I mean, lie after lie after lie, and they get people to believe it. So how is that any better? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=622.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, so the critical difference is, as I said, and I think it'll become really clear as we [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=627.68s)]
*  talk about this, the echo machine has been awesome for the right, it's been a disaster for the left. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=633.3599999999999s)]
*  And you're pointing out some of those ways. The sort of silver bullet of democracy is on the ballot [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  as the primary message didn't work. The moving into sort of like after the first two weeks of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=644.08s)]
*  Kamala Harris's campaign, it became significantly more technocratic and repetitive and discussions [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=650.08s)]
*  about if you start a business, you'll get, was it a tax credit or a deduction? Was it refundable or [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=655.84s)]
*  not for the business expenses to open that business? All of that stuff, which the left echo [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=660.88s)]
*  machine repeated, was extraordinarily destructive for the left and for Democrats. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=667.6s)]
*  The overhype of Biden in the elite media was definitely a problem. The other aspect to this [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=674.0s)]
*  that I think should be mentioned of again, how this has completely failed the left. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=680.4s)]
*  And to a certain degree, it's like they've built something very effective on the right, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  which maybe we'll talk about. I talk about in the book is when it comes to an issue like, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=688.64s)]
*  for example, crime. And I know you guys have talked about this on TYT quite a bit. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=693.44s)]
*  Even if it is true that the 30 year trend line is violent crime down, homicide down, property crime [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=699.0400000000001s)]
*  down, even if that's true, even if it's true that Oklahoma City's crime rate is higher than New York [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=707.12s)]
*  City's crime rate, you can't be seen as ignoring the sincere concerns of folks like your co-host, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=712.72s)]
*  Anna, for example. And as I hit my mic here, as I'm getting very agitated on this topic, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=720.1600000000001s)]
*  you can't be seen as brushing that off no matter what the facts are. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=726.64s)]
*  And that really hurt Kamala Harris in the last six weeks of the campaign. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, so first of all, it is true that crime is down over the last 30 years. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=734.1600000000001s)]
*  All those things are true that you're stating, but it's also true that crime rose in the major [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=740.24s)]
*  cities between 2019 and 2023. And so now we're splitting into two different echo chambers, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=745.6s)]
*  though. MSNBC tells you that corporate Democrats are the greatest thing that's ever happened, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=751.2s)]
*  and they're all wonderful, etc. I think it's a lie factory, if you ask me. I'm curious, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=756.08s)]
*  again, I wanna go back to that with you in a second. But then you've got the far left [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=762.4s)]
*  echo chamber online who says no crime, it doesn't exist. It's a right wing narrative. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=765.9200000000001s)]
*  I deny all the stats between 2019 and 2023. And I believe that Democrats don't care about crime. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=772.1600000000001s)]
*  That hurt us a lot. And it wasn't just that, hey, you're not acknowledging what people are [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=780.48s)]
*  thinking and perceiving. You're also not acknowledging reality. Crime did go up in [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=787.6s)]
*  those four years. And people in major cities like Portland and Oakland, very, very Democratic cities [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=793.44s)]
*  didn't imagine it. They didn't get tricked by Fox News into thinking crime went up. Crime [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=802.4000000000001s)]
*  actually went up. So isn't it a problem that a huge portion of our side lives in denial of reality? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=807.12s)]
*  MSNBC It's absolutely a problem. And in the book, I talk about how we've really kind of lost a shared [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=814.5600000000001s)]
*  basis in fact from which we can then figure out what policy should be. The classic example is [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=820.8s)]
*  climate change, which is just because you acknowledge that it's happening and humans are [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=826.88s)]
*  playing a role doesn't necessarily prescribe what the policies should be. The policies then are a [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=831.52s)]
*  debate, but we've got to agree on what the facts are to start figuring that out. And similarly, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=836.88s)]
*  when I would put out a 10 point plan on what I think should happen with the police, defund the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=841.76s)]
*  police wasn't on it. It was different types of reform. In some places you might need more [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=846.8s)]
*  funding. Maybe some places are overfunded, but that's not really a solution. I would get a lot [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=851.28s)]
*  of heat from it from the folks that you're describing right now who kind of just didn't [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=856.9599999999999s)]
*  want to acknowledge reality. So I think that is a massive, massive problem. And again, this goes to [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=860.4799999999999s)]
*  what I think is fundamentally up until they win, right? This is during campaigns. The right echo [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  machine is inclusive in a way that the left is exclusionary and it's just killing the left in [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=873.12s)]
*  elections. Well, I mean, look, you disagree with defund the police by a shade as you just described, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=880.24s)]
*  right? And they folks try to exclude you. We acknowledge the crime stats, people try to [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=886.08s)]
*  exclude us. So if you're just excluding even the most progressive shows in the country, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=892.48s)]
*  who are you including? How microscopic is this tent or do you want this tent to be? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=899.84s)]
*  And then you wonder why we lost the popular vote. But even so, David, I would say that that's a [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=905.9200000000001s)]
*  smaller problem than the MSNBC crew that keeps telling us don't change any of the policies. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=911.2800000000001s)]
*  The status quo is awesome. Corporate rule is awesome. And Joe Biden is young. So that was just, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=918.4000000000001s)]
*  that was, I mean, you're talking about denying reality. It was borderline insane. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=926.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think one of the things that is pointing, I'm curious your thought, in a better direction [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=930.08s)]
*  is when you look at the last week of events and you hear the message from Bernie and from AOC [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=937.36s)]
*  and from Greg Kassar and John Ossoff in Georgia, etc. I'm sort of cautiously optimistic that there [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=945.0400000000001s)]
*  is a realization that for better or worse, kind of like the Pelosi Schumer status quo doctrine [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=952.32s)]
*  has now been clearly identified as a political loser at this point in time. I don't know what [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=959.9200000000001s)]
*  you think. Maybe I'm the one who's being naive now, but I'm sort of cautiously optimistic that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=964.4000000000001s)]
*  there is a sea change there. And, you know, one of the things that I think we can point to is [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=968.32s)]
*  the MSNBC and CNN post-election ratings never recovered. We had three days during which people [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=972.48s)]
*  were really despondent and upset and sort of bailed out. I'm talking about like November 6 to 9. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=978.88s)]
*  And since then, we had the best January ever, the best February ever, and we're on track for [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=984.0s)]
*  the best March ever. The people as they come back seem to be coming back for something different. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=988.0s)]
*  It doesn't win you a single election. We have to see what happens, but I am feeling something a [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=992.96s)]
*  little different here. No, definitely. But we haven't, let's put it this way, not we haven't [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=997.28s)]
*  been tested. Mainstream media hasn't been tested yet. So what I mean by that is, no, people, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1003.92s)]
*  I mean, first of all, the Democratic voters love what Bernie and AOC are saying. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1010.0s)]
*  I just did a segment right before this one about how their tour is doing fantastic. We've got [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  Young Turks members writing in, 35,000 people in Denver, the most Bernie's ever gotten, etc. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1019.92s)]
*  So the voters absolutely love it. That's completely clear. And then the segment I did was about how [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1025.2s)]
*  Morning Joe is pretending to like it. And I've now read several New York Times columns pretending [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1031.36s)]
*  to like it, but I don't believe them. So that, I mean, I think that when the next Bernie comes [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1037.04s)]
*  in the primary, the New York Times and MSNBC are going to be our number one opponents. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  That they're going to- [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1047.6s)]
*  I am suspicious of what you're saying. At the same time, I don't believe that Trump is against [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1048.56s)]
*  abortion, but it doesn't matter because he is governing and saying everything as if he is. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1057.44s)]
*  And in the same way, you're probably right that if MSNBC and the New York Times and whoever [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  ultimately come around, it won't be sincere, but maybe it doesn't matter, right? And I think this [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1068.8s)]
*  is the kind of critical thing here, which is if ultimately the goal is to get power, if there is [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1074.3200000000002s)]
*  some way to get buy-in from whoever, even if deep down they don't really agree, I think that this is [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1081.3600000000001s)]
*  the way that the echo machine needs to be leveraged by the left to actually be something that helps [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1086.32s)]
*  us win and get power rather than lose again. So you're probably right that they're only going [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  to ever pretend to like it, but that may actually be good enough. I don't know. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1095.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so at all because for me, the ultimate goal is not to get power. I don't really [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1100.24s)]
*  care about whether Buttigieg and Newsom have power. I couldn't care less. The ultimate goal- [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1106.32s)]
*  Well, no, I'm saying the movement you're saying you support for that to get power so that the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1110.96s)]
*  right policies can become a reality. No, okay, that's fair and I understand what you're saying, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1115.12s)]
*  David. But the ultimate goal is to actually get the bills passed and affect people's lives. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1118.4799999999998s)]
*  If we don't get the bills passed, then a Democrat winning was useless or maybe even [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1125.4399999999998s)]
*  counterproductive because one more time they let people down, one more time, we're gonna do [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1129.84s)]
*  what we're gonna do. No, we're not. That'll show you forever believing a Democrat or voting for [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1135.1999999999998s)]
*  a Democrat. We're never ever ever ever gonna do anything because at the end of the day, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1140.0s)]
*  we're just corporate goons. So that's why like David, I guess last question, we'll see if it [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1143.52s)]
*  really is. If Buttigieg comes in with Bernie's policies, I wouldn't believe him for a second. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1149.36s)]
*  And I see Gavin now pretending to be a populist. I don't believe him. I will never support those [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1158.6399999999999s)]
*  guys. I think they're total liars and they're like, this is a new gimmick. I like this gimmick. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1165.44s)]
*  So, okay, now you know how I feel. What do you think? If Buttigieg says Bernie's [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1170.96s)]
*  policies, do you believe him? I don't know. I would have some skepticism the way you have. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1175.28s)]
*  I think here's the print, the heuristic that I'm applying on this. And I do talk about this in the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1181.68s)]
*  book, which is it would be a continued failure for the Democratic Party to have the idea of what [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1186.32s)]
*  the right candidate should do say, sound like, look like, etc. To take someone that isn't that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1194.16s)]
*  and to try to make them into this thing. It comes off as disingenuous. It happened with [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1200.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris. The first two weeks seemed like the real Kamala. And then I don't know who got in. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1205.04s)]
*  You probably know better than I do. And all of a sudden it was a completely different thing. They [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1210.08s)]
*  wanted to turn her into something different. What I would like to see is find the candidate that is [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1213.44s)]
*  just genuinely what the voters actually want and what would be good for the country. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1219.2s)]
*  And don't do the thing where you say, now let's turn them into whatever. And if you can say a lot [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1223.76s)]
*  of really accurately negative things about Donald Trump when he hung out on the NELC boys and Rogan [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1229.28s)]
*  and Lex Friedman and PBD and all of this stuff. It's just the real Trump hanging out. It's a lie [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1236.24s)]
*  a minute for sure. But there's a genuineness that we just are not finding yet on the left. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1242.08s)]
*  And I don't want to see that. So I share your skepticism. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1248.72s)]
*  Yeah. And so the difference is that you can be authentic and be a liar at the same time. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1251.12s)]
*  That's Donald Trump's authentic self is pathological liar. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1257.04s)]
*  But you get a sense of authenticity. And so you can see it when the Schumers of the world [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1261.68s)]
*  do the hey, they're billionaire buddy videos and they all do the same video. It's totally [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1268.08s)]
*  inauthentic versus Bernie and AOC on the trail there and saying it like they actually believe it. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1272.24s)]
*  And it makes a big difference whether that happens or not. All right, so David, we're gonna keep [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1279.2s)]
*  track on this. We should talk more often. We need to, and actually, of course, one last question, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1283.76s)]
*  as I always do. Look, can we agree on this at least to be more inclusive as you're saying [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1290.32s)]
*  in the book and in your show? That if we disagree on certain issues, so what, right? We disagree on [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1296.72s)]
*  whether trans people should be forced into professional women's leagues or not. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1303.84s)]
*  Or we disagree on Israel or we disagree on anything else. Can we all at least agree to agree [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1309.44s)]
*  on the core economic issues that unite all Democrats and that we not like, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1316.0s)]
*  bury each other and hate each other over the things we disagree on? While we continue to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1323.2s)]
*  disagree, there's nothing wrong with that. We should keep that going, right? But also- [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1329.6000000000001s)]
*  I completely agree. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1333.04s)]
*  Yeah, but focus on the things we agree on that the whole country agrees on. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1334.4s)]
*  Without a doubt, and again, I think that the politics of exclusion ultimately lose, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1340.16s)]
*  like you look at history and you look at all of the 20th century examples that I include in my book. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1346.72s)]
*  The accelerationist stuff loses, which is also to what you're pointing out, will disagree, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1352.64s)]
*  but we can agree enough to win and then do policy that makes sense for the greatest number of people [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1358.0800000000002s)]
*  and keep disagreeing on some of the stuff. And there's just not evidence that it has worked. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1362.96s)]
*  And I don't think all of a sudden the exclusionary stuff will start working. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1368.4s)]
*  All right, everybody check out David Pakman's show and of course the Echo Machine, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1371.3600000000001s)]
*  how right wing extremism created a post-truth America. David, thanks for joining us. Appreciate [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1375.76s)]
*  it. Thanks for having me. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets its wings. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1380.0s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62puO6o1vlk&t=1384.3200000000002s)]
