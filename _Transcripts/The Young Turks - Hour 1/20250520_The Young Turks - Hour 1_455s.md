TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Cenk Has A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0)
*  I'm going to read some of our YouTube member comments. You can hit the join button to become [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=0.0s)]
*  a member. Nani Dragon said, Bernie's retiring and has nothing left to lose. He wants to leave a good [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=3.92s)]
*  legacy. This is vintage Bernie we're seeing about his appearance on the flagrant podcast. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=8.16s)]
*  Couldn't agree more. I wish he did that the last four years with Biden, but that's a touchy topic. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  For now, I love that Bernie's back. Bruce City Mike writes in, you could agree with Bernie and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=17.6s)]
*  want him to go further. He's still using 2016-20 ideas, which while still valid, need to be pushed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  further. I disagree. I think those were popular ideas. I think he actually lost some support in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=27.76s)]
*  2020 when he succumbed to the identity police. And look, if you want to fracture the Democratic [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  Party, meaning the voters within the Democratic Party and literally get nothing done, great, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=40.56s)]
*  let's keep going in the direction we've been going in. But I'm a little bit sick of like this, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=44.72s)]
*  me, me, me, my group matters the most, F everyone else. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=49.2s)]
*  Not only is it immoral and not effective, it's a surefire path to losing, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  which is, in my opinion, one of the main reasons why we continue to lose. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=59.84s)]
*  But we don't know what Bruce City Mike meant by that. He might have meant, for example, hey, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  instead of $15 a million wage, we should now be pushing for $17 a million wage. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=67.84s)]
*  I mean, if that's what you're referring to, I agree, but I've seen his comments before, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  and I suspect that's not the case. Okay, we don't know, but thank you for writing in. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=74.08000000000001s)]
*  Carrie writes, and by the way, you can write in a clarification. Carrie writes, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=78.16s)]
*  Wright writes in, as an Air Force vet, Israel is not our friend. They're one of, if not still, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=81.91999999999999s)]
*  the top spies of America. DC has been occupied. Will you two help my mental health? The intensity [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  you all shows how we feel. My membership will run out any day now, so until it runs out, thank you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=93.6s)]
*  I will keep watching, and when I get money, I'll not only get my membership back, but I can't wait [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=100.24s)]
*  to donate to the rebellion. So I appreciate that so much. Guys, first, take care of yourself, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=104.64s)]
*  okay? Make sure you're all right and your family's all right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=109.04s)]
*  And then if you love what we're doing and you wanna give it a bigger voice, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=111.44s)]
*  amazing, we appreciate it. Hit the join button or you can go to tyt.com slash join, where you can [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=115.92s)]
*  get a couple of months off of membership. And she's also referring to Rebellion PAC, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=120.8s)]
*  which by the way, today we're announcing our third candidate, all populists, all focusing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=126.8s)]
*  exactly on what Bernie's talking about. So thank you for writing in, I appreciate it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=132.0s)]
*  Visitor writes in, I mean, one of the hardest realities Gaza has taught us is that there are [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=136.0s)]
*  those around us and in power who do not value morality the way we do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=139.76s)]
*  Right. My God, brother. So yeah, look, this is one of the things I get most upset with [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=144.0s)]
*  mainstream media on, and how they pretend that the politicians are good, honest, decent people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  The honorable gentlemen from Connecticut, etc. They're not honorable at all. I think the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=153.76s)]
*  overwhelming majority of them are crooks. They just take donor money and do whatever the donors [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=159.12s)]
*  tell them. So that's why Netanyahu is a monster. He's one of the worst terrorists of our lifetime. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  And how many standing ovations has he gotten from our deeply, deeply corrupt Congress? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  And yes, there's more Republicans than Democrats who do that. But the great majority of the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  Democratic Party usually goes to those events and applauds Netanyahu and takes money from APAC [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  and brags about it. So these parties are bought. I can't stand it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=185.28s)]
*  The best path, in my opinion, is to retake the Democratic Party and bring it to the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=190.32s)]
*  values of FDR and Bernie Sanders and get corporate PAC money out. And that's why [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=195.04s)]
*  rebellion does that. But if you're looking for morality, as Tyrion Lannister would say, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=199.28s)]
*  if you're looking at Washington, you've come to the wrong place. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=204.48s)]
*  By the way, if you're viewing this video after our live show, just know that we like to get [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=208.8s)]
*  comments from our members, super chats, and from our Twitch community. All live viewers, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=215.36s)]
*  we take their comments, read them, and engage with our live audience. So you can do that by [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=221.2s)]
*  watching and commenting during our live show Monday through Friday at 3 PM Pacific, 6 PM Eastern. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=225.28s)]
*  And we go for two and a half hours, so. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=232.08s)]
*  Yeah, and then the last parts for members only. Last couple of members here from YouTube, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=233.84s)]
*  these are just members now. All the guys I read, Aaron Bushnell says, I'm not sure even [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=237.52s)]
*  the Arabs have that much money. We're talking about how they could out bribe Israel earlier [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  in the program with the 400 million for the Qatar jet and the couple of billion dollar deal that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  Trump organization is getting, etc. I don't know, we'll see. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=252.08s)]
*  By the way, there's an update to that story. So apparently, now there are allegations that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=254.8s)]
*  Trump's the one who approached the Qataris about giving him that $400 million jet. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=261.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm not at all surprised by that. But at this point, Trump's corruption, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  if it heads towards the Arab plan instead of the Israeli plan for Gaza, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=274.0s)]
*  might be an ironic silver lining. Aaron Bushnell wrote in, I'm sorry, Susan Blackburn wrote in, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=278.24s)]
*  wish my tax dollars was funding the National Weather Service. I wouldn't have to stay up all [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=283.92s)]
*  night so I don't die in a tornado that wasn't warned or warned properly. Yes, instead of that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=288.16s)]
*  getting funded, your money's going to Israel, your money's going to $5 trillion in tax cuts [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=293.84s)]
*  and the big beautiful bill. And so it's a disaster. They never ever give it to you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  There's actually an economic principle called middle out, where instead of giving to the very [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  richest people, you give it to the middle class, they spend it quicker and that actually revitalizes [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=308.23999999999995s)]
*  the economy better. That's the correct strategy that progressives and populists should be in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  favor of and people like Bernie Sanders and Ro Khanna are. Auntie Lou says, thanks for covering [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=317.76s)]
*  Bernie on the flagrant pod, good interview. Last couple here, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=323.28s)]
*  Bernie says, I can already hear the ladies from the view going rabid over Bernie again. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=326.55999999999995s)]
*  Oh my gosh. Yeah, and in fact, we're not covering it today, but [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=330.32s)]
*  just earlier, they came out and they were furious at anyone questioning Biden. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=335.2s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=340.32s)]
*  Of course, of course. They're like, how dare you? Biden was like one of the great presidents and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  he was just an, look, it's just the fact that they can't see that they're doing propaganda [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=347.28s)]
*  is amazing. It's amazing. Okay. And then finally, Michael Amount Senior says, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  we live in very unique political times. I'm glad that I have TYT to provide me with news that I can [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  trust. Thank you, Jane Kanana for fearlessly telling us like it is no matter what you both [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  are loved. Michael, thanks for saying that. But guys, look, there is no us without you guys. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=370.32s)]
*  So we do this show together. That's why we read the member comments during the show. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  That's why we interact with you guys. We do the live chats on the polls and stuff. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  So come watch every day Mondays through Fridays at six o'clock Eastern, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=382.0s)]
*  six to eight is public for everyone. And these days I'm doing interviews at eight o'clock oftentimes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=386.64s)]
*  So we had Ben Cohen on and we had Sean Spicer on and we grilled them on the Trump policies, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=391.2s)]
*  etc. And tonight, I'll announce it now. The third candidate for rebellion pack, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=398.32s)]
*  Randy Bryce, Iron Stash is back. He's an iron worker out of Wisconsin. He's gonna run in a [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=404.88s)]
*  largely red district and he's gonna win it. We're bringing economic populism back with the most [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=411.28s)]
*  populist candidates you've ever seen. Randy Bryce in Wisconsin, Richard Ojeda in North Carolina, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=416.55999999999995s)]
*  and Ro Khanna in Congress already. And a lot more on the way and you could apply at rebellionpack.com. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  What we try to do on this show is give you something positive to build around. So what [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  are we gonna do with rebellion pack? We're gonna take power back for the right part of the Democratic [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  Party on 2026. That populist wing of the Democratic Party, I'm gonna rebuild the Democratic Party to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=438.16s)]
*  what it was. And you do that through honesty and independence. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzcmWFQ2Ip0&t=444.64000000000004s)]
