The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Super CRINGE Trump Presidential Portrait Released
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A)
*  Trump's official White House portrait was released today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=0.0s)]
*  Certainly not your traditional portrait. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=3.92s)]
*  It is not your traditional White House portrait. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=5.8s)]
*  And if you're taking a look at it, you could see why. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=8.6s)]
*  You might notice something very familiar. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=11.16s)]
*  The President-elect making sort of the same face he made when his mugshot was taken. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=13.82s)]
*  Of course, many people drawing attention to this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=19.92s)]
*  We have no, it's unclear why the President-elect wanted to make this space. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=22.16s)]
*  But I will tell you, Lindsey, look, I covered President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=25.36s)]
*  Defiant was a major theme from the campaign now to the White House. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=29.04s)]
*  So the portrait is out. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=33.36s)]
*  I know everybody has been waiting for it and you can now see it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  This was the transition team released these. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=38.12s)]
*  We'll give you another look right there and you can see. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=41.36s)]
*  JD Vance, don't you worry. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=44.76s)]
*  We'll get to you and whatever it is that you're doing there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=46.28s)]
*  But you have Trump, I think is drawing a lot of the attention because he's clearly glowering. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=48.76s)]
*  I think that the reporter that you saw there is right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  He's trying to do the prison thing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=55.92s)]
*  Look, I'm not a big fan of Trump and so I read it a little bit differently. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  If we can put that up again, I'm getting, it's harsh lighting, obviously. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=62.96s)]
*  It's supposed to be a little bit ominous. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=66.8s)]
*  So weird lighting, you've got something kind of like hair on his head. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=68.82000000000001s)]
*  I don't know how to read that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=72.16s)]
*  And Edwin said he looks like he's maybe having a stroke. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=74.06s)]
*  There's obviously a big difference in how open his eyes are. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=77.12s)]
*  One is really open, one isn't. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=80.16s)]
*  I don't know neurologically what that means. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  And he looks like he might be pooping into his presidential diapers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=84.04s)]
*  But anyway, there's just a lot here that doesn't really read as presidential or normal or attractive [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=86.96s)]
*  to me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=92.88s)]
*  But I don't wanna be overly shallow. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=93.88s)]
*  I'll turn to you, Yaz. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=95.4s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=96.56s)]
*  I'm already really tired of seeing these pictures everywhere. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=98.92s)]
*  Every time I open my phone, there are these pictures just staring at me, glowering at [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=101.88s)]
*  me. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=106.6s)]
*  The thing is, if they're going to use so much Photoshop on these photos, couldn't they make [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=107.6s)]
*  him less orange, make him a more normal color instead of whatever that bronze orange is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  that there was going for? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=116.24s)]
*  The shading is crazy, the lighting is crazy, the image is crazy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  Just the way that he chose to present himself as the 47th president, especially when you [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  compare it to the 45th presidency shot, it's very different. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=127.22s)]
*  And he really thinks that he's commanding some kind of presence. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=131.28s)]
*  I don't get that, but people will see in it what they wanna see. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=134.32s)]
*  Yeah, I know you mentioned JD Vance's picture, but it looks like a glamour shot, man. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=138.52s)]
*  It looks like a Facetune glamour shot. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=142.76s)]
*  And then he was like, yeah, just take this, a picture that his wife took on her phone, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=145.96s)]
*  went into Facetune and then sent it in. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=150.28s)]
*  Do that one, I like that one, I like how I look in this one. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=152.28s)]
*  My God, David, you're looking presidential. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=155.96s)]
*  I think he may be onto something. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=157.84s)]
*  We can all put up lights against our face and maybe that's how we do it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=160.32s)]
*  The thing that bothers me, and normally I wouldn't care about Donald Trump and his lighting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=164.24s)]
*  and all that kind of stuff. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=168.22s)]
*  But the fact is, if you go into Washington DC and you go to any government building, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=168.94s)]
*  any federal government agency or building, there's a picture of the sitting president [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=172.78s)]
*  and there's a picture of the sitting vice president. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=176.66s)]
*  And are we to believe that this crazy, overlit, glamour photo that Donald Trump puts up, that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=179.1s)]
*  that's now gonna be in every government building in Washington DC and every federal agency? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=186.3s)]
*  Because I guarantee people who walk in there are gonna be like, my, this is a joke, right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=190.94s)]
*  This isn't serious. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=196.26s)]
*  Is that what we're to believe now about all these government agencies and that this is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=198.34s)]
*  all just a joke? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  And so it strikes me as this isn't serious. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=203.5s)]
*  Just take the regular photo with the flag over you and put up that picture. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  You wanna have a glamour shot at the entrance to the White House or on your web page, that's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=211.42s)]
*  fine. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=215.62s)]
*  But if this is the official portrait that goes everywhere, man, oh man, there are gonna [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=216.62s)]
*  be a lot of laughing people laughing not with Donald Trump, but laughing at our government. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=220.74s)]
*  Yeah, every time you go get your passport, that's what you gotta look at. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  And that's what I think of. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=231.98s)]
*  Well, the right appears to love it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=232.98s)]
*  The transition team definitely did. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=235.5s)]
*  If we could jump to graphic three, they said they describe the portrait says, they go hard. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=237.61999999999998s)]
*  I don't know what in this context that's supposed to mean. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=244.5s)]
*  I can explain that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  That's actually a reference to JD Vance. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=250.42s)]
*  You can't see the couch in his photo that's below him. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=252.89999999999998s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=256.66s)]
*  Sorry, I shouldn't have gone there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=257.66s)]
*  No, you should not have. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=259.94s)]
*  I have no idea what they're talking about. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=261.34s)]
*  Hard as in Donald Trump is hard, he's tough. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=263.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=266.02s)]
*  Come on. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=267.02s)]
*  Yeah, mentally, did he bust into another one of the contestants, the 14-year-old contestants [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=268.02s)]
*  on one of his beauty pageants again? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=273.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=274.86s)]
*  But yeah, the right loves this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=275.86s)]
*  They see those two photos and they think these are manly tough men. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=277.18s)]
*  To reasonable, rational people who are not knee deep in the cult, that makes no sense [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=282.06s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=286.2s)]
*  But to those in the thick of it, they love this stuff. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=287.2s)]
*  I'll remind you of what Jesse Watters said about Donald Trump's very similar mugshot. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=290.08s)]
*  I am now going to book the Fulton County photographer for my Christmas card. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=297.36s)]
*  Because judge and I say this with a unblemished record of heterosexuality. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=303.24s)]
*  He looks good. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=309.68s)]
*  And he looks hard. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=312.24s)]
*  It's a handsome mugshot. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=313.24s)]
*  My wife says he looks fierce. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=314.68s)]
*  He looks hard. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=317.08s)]
*  It is strange. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=318.08s)]
*  I wish they would stop. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=319.08s)]
*  It is strange for a guy. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=320.08s)]
*  I wish they would stop saying he looks hard. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=321.08s)]
*  Please stop. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=322.08s)]
*  They need to stop saying. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=323.08s)]
*  Please stop saying that he looks hard. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=324.08s)]
*  I know that you're thinking about your own nether regions and that's infecting your vocabulary, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  but please stop saying it, Jesse Watters. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=333.64s)]
*  Anyway, for a guy who goes through his day critiquing every possible choice. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=335.88s)]
*  Should I use a straw? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=341.24s)]
*  Should I eat soup? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=343.16s)]
*  No, that'll make me look gay. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=344.16s)]
*  That'll make me look gay. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=345.32000000000005s)]
*  My secret will be revealed. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  To then just go on TV with a camera in your face and say how hard and hot and fierce he [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  is is such a weird choice. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  And I will remind everyone it was alluded to earlier. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=355.12s)]
*  If we go to the final photo, this was Trump's photo from the previous term, much more normal. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=358.0s)]
*  It's kind of what presidential portraits I guess look like. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  Again, weird hair like substance on his head. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=369.04s)]
*  That was a strange choice. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=371.5s)]
*  I will say and I want to close with this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=373.32s)]
*  It's strange and as David pointed out, we're gonna have to see that everywhere we go. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=376.0s)]
*  But I also think it's kind of appropriate for the period of America that we've entered [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=380.44s)]
*  into. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=386.32s)]
*  It is going to be a dark, painful, violent place. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=387.52s)]
*  He promised us blood. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  It's gonna be a bloody process to get all these damn migrants out. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=393.7s)]
*  And Elon Musk is promising that there's gonna be very painful, hard economic times with [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=396.88s)]
*  tariffs and doge and all that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=402.76s)]
*  I think the face he's making properly communicates the way he sees America. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=405.24s)]
*  It's stern and it's glowering and it's judging. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not inviting. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not warm or welcoming or proud or happy in any way. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  If he were to smile, I think that would be weirdly incongruent with the way he will be [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=422.9s)]
*  president. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9BqfNW7A&t=428.84s)]
