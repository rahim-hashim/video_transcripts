# Mark Carney Says Canada ISN‚ÄôT FOR SALE. Biden Has NO REGRETS About 2024. - May 7, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg)
*  Hello and welcome to the Young Turks. I'm Yasmin Ali Khan and I'm here with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=0.0s)]
*  Wozni Lambre. He's a senior writer over at The Ringer and the host of Woz Speaks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=6.0s)]
*  But you all know Woz. How are you doing tonight, Woz? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=10.64s)]
*  I'm doing fantastic. Super happy to be on with you guys again. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Cenk and Ana are both out tonight, so this is what you get. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=17.12s)]
*  But it's gonna be a great show. I shouldn't say but, it will be. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=21.76s)]
*  It sounded like they were on punishment. That we were putting the audience in the corner. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  I always feel like they have certain expectations coming to the show and then you're like, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=32.96s)]
*  oh, it's these guys, but it's still fun. It's full of good times. So I'm just trying to manage [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=37.44s)]
*  expectations now that we're already here together. So that's it. All right, but we do have a lot of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=42.0s)]
*  stories to get to. Quite a news filled day today, actually. So let's get right into this first story. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=48.32s)]
*  I can hear your passion. I can hear your anxiety that the world is changing the way it has. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=55.52s)]
*  And for a long time you believed. You said, I'm the man who can stop Donald Trump. And you did once. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=61.92s)]
*  And in the end, you withdrew from that election campaign at the last minute. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  It's a question you know lots of people ask you, Mr. President. Did you leave it too late? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=75.6s)]
*  Should you have withdrawn earlier, given someone else a bigger job? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=81.36s)]
*  I don't think it would have mattered. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=86.48s)]
*  That was former President Joe Biden and he sat down for an interview with BBC host Nick Robinson, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=89.84s)]
*  in which Robinson asked him if he regretted his decision to drop out of the presidential race when [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  he did and not sooner. The TLDR of it is that no, he doesn't. But before we discuss, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=105.36s)]
*  let's hear more of his response. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=111.28s)]
*  We left at a time when we had a good candidate. She's fully funded. And what happened was, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=112.8s)]
*  I had become what we had set out to do. No one thought we could do. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=124.88s)]
*  And become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, now I'm gonna stop now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=133.6s)]
*  I meant when I said when I started that I think I'm prepared to hand this to the next generation, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=139.12s)]
*  the transition government. But things move so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=145.6s)]
*  to get and it was a hard decision. But regret? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=154.55999999999997s)]
*  No, I think it was the right decision. I think that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=165.76s)]
*  well, it was just a difficult decision. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  So it seems as though he has a lot of complicated feelings around it. And yeah, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=176.4s)]
*  I imagine it was a very hard decision to come by. I have my own thoughts and feelings on it, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=182.72s)]
*  as I'm sure most of you do. But let's just look back a little bit, back to July of 2024, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=188.88s)]
*  to get a reminder of where the country was at at the time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=195.52s)]
*  This is how the sentiment was following the June 2024 presidential debate. And Joe Biden [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=199.12s)]
*  didn't perform as well as most people were hoping that he would. So 56% of Democrats and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=205.92s)]
*  67% of all Americans believe Biden should withdraw given his performance in the debate. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=212.64s)]
*  The Washington Post, ABC News, Ipsos poll found while new highs of 85% of Americans say Biden is [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=218.56s)]
*  too old for a second term. And 60% say the same of Trump. Both men receive 46% support among all [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=226.0s)]
*  registered voters, nearly unchanged from the last edition of the poll in April. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=233.92s)]
*  Another poll released by the Pew Research Center was not any better for Biden, finding that Trump [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=239.92s)]
*  leads the incumbent 50% to 47% in a head-to-head matchup among registered voters. Trump's lead has [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=245.44s)]
*  widened marginally from April when Pew reported that 49% favored him and 48 chose Biden. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=253.44s)]
*  So after Biden finally decided to drop out of the race in July, he named Kamala Harris as [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=260.64s)]
*  the new candidate and he bypassed the entire primary process in doing so. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=269.44s)]
*  There was a lot of feelings around that as well at the time. But the New York Times published an [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  article with this headline. Americans may not agree on much, but they agree Biden made the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  right choice. The president's decision to exit the race received overwhelming support. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=284.24s)]
*  Only a few other things have drawn as much consensus in polling. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=289.68s)]
*  The article also cites a New York Times, Sienna College poll that found that 87% of registered [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=294.72s)]
*  voters approved of Biden's decision to drop out of the race with only 9% disapproving. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=300.72s)]
*  Was, I know that July of last year seems like forever ago, like a long time ago. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=307.04s)]
*  So much has happened since then. But it is interesting to kind of get back into that head [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=312.0s)]
*  space of where the entire country was at. It did feel very, very hopeless after that debate. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=317.92s)]
*  I remember that feeling and it's just like what's gonna happen. And I was of the impression [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  that there's no way this guy is gonna drop out of the race. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=328.32s)]
*  It was way too close to November at the time that we were even having these discussions. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=330.88s)]
*  Cenk was very adamant that it was gonna happen. He turned out to be right and that's why he's Cenk. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  But now we're getting this interview with Joe Biden after we've been enduring over 100 days [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  the Trump administration and it has not been an easy 100 days. And to hear him come out and say [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=347.28s)]
*  he wouldn't have done anything differently. On one hand, I feel like this doesn't change anything. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=353.11999999999995s)]
*  It doesn't matter how he feels about it really. And he's obviously still processing his own [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=359.11999999999995s)]
*  feelings about it. At the same time, I feel, I don't wanna say betrayed. I feel like that's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=363.76s)]
*  too strong of a word. But I do feel like that seems like a personal thing that he was going through. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  And he put the entire country in flux because of it and it feels a little irresponsible. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=377.04s)]
*  It feels inconsiderate really and maybe I'm just too in my feelings about it, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=382.32s)]
*  but that's how it comes across to me. What do you think? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=385.68s)]
*  I think Joe Biden has an ego that works in such a way that he is just simply incapable of any level [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=387.76000000000005s)]
*  of public humility. This dude's own self-stated mission, we didn't put this on him. This is what [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=398.64s)]
*  Joe Biden claimed. He's the guy that's saving the country from Trump. He's the guy that's giving us [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=407.36s)]
*  all of this stability, etc., etc. Never mind the fact that even in 2020 he was already cooked. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=413.92s)]
*  And the fact of the pandemic made it so that he barely had the campaign. They had that built-in [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=420.8s)]
*  excuse to hide him from everybody because of COVID is like, we gotta avoid crowds, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=425.52s)]
*  etc., etc. And he was basically able to run this basically shell of a campaign. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  And he won anyway and good for him. The establishment wanted Joe Biden. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  They got what he wanted and he deserves the credit for beating Trump. However, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't see how he can see the results of one, the election and now two, what Trump is actually [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  doing in office and say he has no regrets whatsoever about how he handled his departure [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=453.84s)]
*  from the 2024 presidential campaign. That makes absolutely no sense and it just shows you [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=461.76s)]
*  the level of egomania of this guy and deliriousness of this dude that he thinks what he did was right [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=468.08s)]
*  and just. The idea that stealing the opportunity for the Democratic base to have a primary where [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=475.2s)]
*  the actual voters got to decide on a candidate after a rigorous primary process where the strongest [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=483.68s)]
*  candidate would have emerged and been more better suited to beating Donald Trump and doing stuff [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  like, I don't know, talking to a freaking podcaster for an hour and a half. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  You would think that we would have been able to have a nice enough process that somebody who could [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=508.0s)]
*  stand up to that level of scrutiny would have emerged victorious. Instead, we get Joe and also [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=512.32s)]
*  too, and I know you guys covered this on TYT. I forget if it was political or whoever covered [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=519.84s)]
*  this. I'm sorry, I forgive the people who reported on this, but Joe Biden telling Kamala Harris before [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=525.44s)]
*  her first debate, quote unquote, no daylight kid. Meaning run exactly as I would have even though [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=531.2800000000001s)]
*  I was getting trounced in the polls and everybody should have been doing their best to run [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=539.28s)]
*  exactly far away as possible as they could. I think if Joe Biden gave a damn about the country, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=544.64s)]
*  gave a damn about his party, gave a damn about winning, he would have approached this interview [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=550.88s)]
*  with some humility and be like, look, we lost. How could I have no regrets about how I handled things? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=555.8399999999999s)]
*  Maybe in the recesses of our mind, there's things I could have did different to balance the scales [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=561.76s)]
*  in favor of my party and ultimately the American people who I care about so much. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=567.84s)]
*  He can't even bring himself to do that. I think it's quite pathetic and embarrassing. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=572.96s)]
*  Yeah, you have to wonder why he even agreed to do this interview. He did do it with the BBC, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=576.88s)]
*  not in an American network. Not that that really matters. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=583.36s)]
*  No, he thinks people don't get BBC in America. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=586.32s)]
*  We're obviously still watching it here, right? We're still talking about it over here. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=588.88s)]
*  But you're right, it does take a certain level of narcissism to even want to be the president, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=593.04s)]
*  right? You look at this job that is the most difficult job in the world, the most visible job [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=598.4s)]
*  in the world. You're over not just all of your American constituents, but the things that you do, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=604.16s)]
*  the decisions that you make impact people around the world. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=609.04s)]
*  And you look at that and you say, you know what? I'm the best person for that job. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  You have to be a little crazy, if not a little bit narcissistic to even want that job, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=616.48s)]
*  to think that you're capable of performing that job and to think that you're good enough to win. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=621.2s)]
*  But yeah, I think I agree with you. I'm not sympathetic anymore to their feelings and to [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=626.24s)]
*  their lack of insight into the American people and what we want and to their out of touchness [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=632.96s)]
*  with what we want. We were telling them, we were begging Joe Biden to step aside, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=638.64s)]
*  to not run for reelection for so long. And he just said, you know what? No, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=643.28s)]
*  I'm gonna do it. And now he's doing this interview and he's saying, yeah, it was hard [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=646.48s)]
*  for me to step away. And I can sympathize with that. But when you're in, again, such a public [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=650.24s)]
*  role and such a crucial role, right? Everything you do is affecting millions, billions of people. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=655.76s)]
*  You don't get to have that luxury of like, I'm a little bit in my feelings. My ego is a little hurt [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=661.52s)]
*  right now by all of this. And on top of that, we have so many elderly congresspeople. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=667.92s)]
*  And I'm speaking specifically about Democrats. Obviously, it's on the Republican side too, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=673.28s)]
*  but the Democrats are the ones that I feel more like are letting me down. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=677.68s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi will not leave. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rest in peace. She put us in quite a pickle [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=682.56s)]
*  by not stepping down. And I know she thought she was doing the right thing, but she really [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  wasn't helping a lot of people in doing so. And then there was another elderly congressperson, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=693.92s)]
*  I can't remember his name right now, but he said that stepping down from his seat right now in [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=698.88s)]
*  Congress would feel like giving up on his entire life. That's not really my problem though. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=704.8s)]
*  You need to deal with that on your own. Figure it out yourself. Figure out your legacy, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=710.88s)]
*  what it all means. And then don't make it everyone's problem. So millions of people's problem. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=715.1999999999999s)]
*  So any final thoughts before we move on to our next story? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  These older party establishment type of folks, they're not going to give up power voluntarily. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=725.12s)]
*  We're going to have to pry it out of their cold dead hands as progressives. And there's just [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=734.88s)]
*  no other alternative, man. That's not how power works. Power doesn't concede. Progressives have [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=742.24s)]
*  to build up a coalition, a funding base that's strong enough to scare the bejesus out of these [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=747.76s)]
*  people so that they could cooperate. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=753.12s)]
*  House Republicans have altered a piece of Trump's mega bill with a plan to overhaul snap food aid [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  benefits. And this would be one of the biggest overhauls to the food aid program in decades. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=780.72s)]
*  The plan to overhaul snap, which of course is a supplemental nutrition assistance program, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=787.0400000000001s)]
*  includes three things. Limiting future increases to benefits, implementing new work requirements, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=791.84s)]
*  and pushing the costs to the states. Because in this government, in Republicans minds, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=798.48s)]
*  small government means almost no government. Just push it all to the states. So what is even left [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  for the federal government? So these changes put millions of low income Americans at risk of being [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=809.44s)]
*  removed from the program. Snap currently helps to feed 40 million low income Americans. 80% [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=815.44s)]
*  are in households with a child under 18, an adult age 60 or over, or an individual who is disabled. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  So Republicans are looking for ways to cut back on snap. Here is this from Politico. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=830.6400000000001s)]
*  Agriculture Republicans will increase the age of recipients who need to complete work requirements [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=835.76s)]
*  to receive food aid, reaching so-called able bodied adults with children age seven and older [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  for the first time. That move alone is expected to save at least $40 billion, according to projections [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=848.0s)]
*  from the Congressional Budget Office. So I want to switch back and talk a little bit more about [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=854.48s)]
*  pushing all of these costs to the states. In March, Senator Mike Lee of Utah introduced a [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=860.32s)]
*  proposal, Snap reform and upward mobility act. That's his and this is what it says. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=866.1600000000001s)]
*  So Lee wants to overhaul the nation's largest federal food assistance program by requiring [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=871.6s)]
*  states to pay a bigger share, starting with 5% more a year until states take on 50% of the costs. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=877.0400000000001s)]
*  That would shift billions of dollars in food stamp costs to states and likely lead to slashed [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=885.28s)]
*  benefits. And here's the best part, Lee's own state would be hit particularly hard and that [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  state is Utah. In Utah, $383 million in total snap benefits were issued in 2024, according to the [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=896.88s)]
*  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In 2026, if the state were to be required to pay 5% of the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=905.92s)]
*  cost, it would cost the state about $19 million. At 10%, Utah's share would be roughly $38 million, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=913.04s)]
*  25% would be $95 million and at 50%, Utah would need to pay an estimated $190 million. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=921.04s)]
*  Why is this is, I mean, it's very sad because these people obviously don't care about the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=929.36s)]
*  people who are going to be most directly affected by this. But as far as pushing these costs from [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=934.24s)]
*  the federal government to the state governments, I don't really understand why a lot of these [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=940.4s)]
*  senators who are in charge of these, specifically in red states where you do have a lot of people [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=946.4s)]
*  who are on these programs. I don't know how they think that this is gonna benefit their state. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  I think they must just be banking on the fact that a lot of people aren't going to link these [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=957.52s)]
*  changes directly to them because of course they wanna get reelected come reelection time, don't [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=962.16s)]
*  they? But overall too, I think whenever you start taking things from the federal government [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=968.16s)]
*  and giving them to the states, Republicans think that there's this idea, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=974.56s)]
*  like there's better representation there. There's more cohesiveness in the states, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=979.36s)]
*  there's more cultural assimilation within the states, right? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=983.92s)]
*  So people, if you're voting on the state basis, that feels more like home. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=987.28s)]
*  Whereas if something comes from the federal government, that guarantees it anywhere you [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=992.24s)]
*  are in the country, right? I should be able to move from state to state with my general [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=997.84s)]
*  needs still being met the way that they're supposed to be guaranteed by the country, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1003.44s)]
*  not just by the state that I'm living in. At this point, it may as well be like the European Union. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1007.44s)]
*  I mean, it's obvious the whole point of this, this idea that they're gonna shift the cost, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1011.36s)]
*  meaning we're just gonna end up sending half the money we send now. It's just a 50% cut [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  in the benefit. That's it, that's all they're doing. They know that politically, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1024.0s)]
*  these are some of the most disenfranchised people in the country. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1030.32s)]
*  So it's not like they're organized to have a voice against this type of thing. And also, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1033.76s)]
*  to be quite frank, the Republican Party specifically for going on like 50 years now, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1039.84s)]
*  has done everything that it could to demonize what they like to call the welfare state or [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1046.48s)]
*  quote unquote entitlement. And basically, they guilt people into thinking that you should be [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1051.2s)]
*  ashamed that because you have a low paying job that you receive assistance from the government. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1057.28s)]
*  It's quite insane, honestly, just the policy. But I mean, it's crazy to me if you just [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1064.64s)]
*  take it in totality with this ridiculous budget and tax cut they're trying to pass where it's like, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1072.48s)]
*  let's increase the military spending to over a trillion dollars, the military spending [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1079.76s)]
*  over a trillion dollars. So let's fatten the bank books of Raytheon and all these other defense [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1087.52s)]
*  contractors. Let's take massive cuts to Medicaid, again, health insurance for people of low income [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1095.4399999999998s)]
*  people. Let's also make sure we give a tax cut to the Americans who are already doing the best. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1102.48s)]
*  This is just the truth. They don't need tax cuts. They're already doing great. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1111.76s)]
*  Their freaking stock portfolios are through the roof. They own multiple homes. Their families [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1118.8s)]
*  go on five vacations a year. They're already doing awesome. Their kids go to the best schools. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1124.64s)]
*  So let's make sure they get even more. And the message being sent is if you're on snap, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1131.76s)]
*  somehow you're a drain and you're a leech on the government and the greatness we're trying to [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1138.32s)]
*  achieve. It's the most harebrained deranged messaging to send to a Fulton group. But again, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1144.72s)]
*  it would take an opposition who aren't just an opposition just to be an opposition, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1151.76s)]
*  but who could articulate an alternative vision and program, an affirmative vision and program [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1156.08s)]
*  that isn't just Republicans bad to expose the ridiculousness of this entire policy agenda. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1164.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the tax cuts that you referred to, I mean, they have to get paid for in one way or [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1172.8s)]
*  another. Whether this is a direct way that they're doing that, I mean, the things that they're [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1178.3999999999999s)]
*  proposing are very, very unsettling. They're gonna sell off public land to pay for it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1182.16s)]
*  You can't just come by trillions of dollars worth of tax cuts without cutting something [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1188.5600000000002s)]
*  elsewhere. The books still have to be balanced. And I think a lot of people who still support [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1193.44s)]
*  these tax cuts that are coming for the rich, I don't know if they just don't understand that [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1198.24s)]
*  or they don't care because it's not gonna affect them or whatever. But it's going to change the [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1202.48s)]
*  landscape of this country in a lot of very real way, physically the landscape of the country. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1206.88s)]
*  Also for Republicans, I feel like maybe all of these culture wars sort of protect their voting [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1212.64s)]
*  base, right? You can't vote in this country. We have two parties, right, in the country. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1217.7600000000002s)]
*  So if you vote for, I'm against abortion, then you're also voting and saying, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1222.24s)]
*  I'm okay with you cutting SNAP benefits. So they are insulated in quite a few ways [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1227.8400000000001s)]
*  with just our two party system and just the nature of it. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1234.24s)]
*  So it is very sad. We'll see how this all plays out in a little bit. So I mean, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1237.28s)]
*  if this ever comes to pass. So with that, before we go, in the last story, I did reference a [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1243.68s)]
*  congressperson. I can't remember who it was. It was James Clyburn who said that him being asked [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1249.6s)]
*  to step away from his seat would be like him choosing death for himself, which is very [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1254.72s)]
*  dramatic, I thought. So on that note, we'll be right back. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1259.52s)]
*  I don't know about you, but I'm gonna go to bed. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1263.04s)]
*  I can hear your passion. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1265.76s)]
*  Welcome back to The Young Turks. You have yas and was in this first hour. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1284.96s)]
*  Good first couple of stories to get started with, but now we have more for you. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1289.68s)]
*  So in Rome today, it is the first day of the papal conclave when 133 cardinals from around the world [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1294.6399999999999s)]
*  will sequester themselves inside the Sistine Chapel until they choose the next pope. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1302.8799999999999s)]
*  Typically, no one knows what goes on inside the chapel during this process. And the process [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1308.24s)]
*  itself is supposed to be divinely guided, right? They're supposed to choose which the next pope [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1313.68s)]
*  and then they send out puffs of smoke to let you know when he's been chosen. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1318.72s)]
*  However, despite the fact that this is such a secret conclave, right? Nobody knows what's [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1322.56s)]
*  going on in there. MAGA is still trying to infiltrate the process and trying to sway [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1328.24s)]
*  the cardinal's decisions to pick the pope that they want to pick. And they're using money and wine [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1333.44s)]
*  to do so. So the days leading up to the conclave are typically full of a lot of [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1339.3600000000001s)]
*  wining and dining, which feels a lot like political lobbying, where various wealthy [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1343.76s)]
*  donors and interest groups hope to convince the cardinals to vote for their preferred [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1349.6s)]
*  pope candidate. This year, the conclave happened to coincide with something called America Week. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1354.16s)]
*  America Week happens once a year and it's when wealthy Americans make a so-called [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1360.16s)]
*  pilgrimage to Rome and they pledge their funds to the Vatican, of course, in exchange for [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1365.84s)]
*  absolutely nothing, right? Well, the organization behind America Week is the Papal Foundation, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1372.32s)]
*  and you can join the foundation for a small donation of just $1 million. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1378.72s)]
*  The president of the foundation is Ward Fitzgerald III, and he touts the foundation's [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  impressive history of donations to the Catholic Church. They gave $250 million in grants, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1389.04s)]
*  scholarships and humanitarian aid since 1998. Doesn't sound bad. At a dinner last week at [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1395.9199999999998s)]
*  the St. Regis in Rome, the foundation announced its very ambitious fundraising goals for the [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1402.24s)]
*  coming years and members disclosed who they would like to see as pope. So I'm sure that neither of [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1407.1200000000001s)]
*  those two things are related. One guest did tell reporters, this room could raise a billion to help [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1413.28s)]
*  the church so long as we have the right pope. There's more to this story, but why is, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1420.08s)]
*  is it, I don't see any quid pro quo, do you? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1427.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, the Catholic Church is one of the few very powerful remaining institutions, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1429.8400000000001s)]
*  right? About a billion members of the Catholic Church, I believe, last I checked, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1439.44s)]
*  obviously super well-funded and well-resourced. It's understandable that people would want to [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1446.24s)]
*  lobby them to curry favor with them because they do have some level of influence. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1452.08s)]
*  I'm just a little bit skeptical as far as the reach because I'm born and raised Catholic, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1457.9199999999998s)]
*  baptism, communion, freaking confirmation, the whole thing. My confirmation name was Peter for [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1464.08s)]
*  those Catholics out there wondering. I've never in my life heard a Catholic person say, I can't or [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1470.72s)]
*  won't or will do something because the pope suggested I do it. Never, it's never happened. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1479.28s)]
*  I don't know Catholics who care about the pope. So I don't get this like hand wringing about who [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  the pope is and what he does because even Catholics don't even care. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1492.16s)]
*  Yeah, that is interesting because I'm not Catholic, but I always wonder about something like that. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1495.28s)]
*  But the truth is, even though this is a religious appointment or religious position, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1502.24s)]
*  it's a very political role and we'll get into that a little bit. So the politicking and the [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1508.96s)]
*  wealthy just buying power from this very ancient institution is even more entrenched in politics [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1514.56s)]
*  than it appears on the surface. So also in Rome last week was the Napa Institute with founder Tim [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1521.44s)]
*  Bush. So this Institute is comprised of wealthy Catholics from the Napa, California area, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1528.4s)]
*  emphasis on wealthy Catholics, but more on that in a little bit. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1534.96s)]
*  So about 20% of the Napa Institute's members are also affiliated with Opus Dei, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1539.8400000000001s)]
*  and that is a conservative Catholic sect that is also affiliated with Project 2025. And there it [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1547.2800000000002s)]
*  is. And this makes sense because many conservatives have felt that Pope Francis was far too liberal [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1553.92s)]
*  for their liking and they want to push the Catholic Church in a much more conservative [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1560.16s)]
*  direction. And according to Tim Bush, the wealthy are just the people to do that. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1564.88s)]
*  Here's what he actually said. It's the lay apostolates that are going to make a difference [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1569.8400000000001s)]
*  because they have better funding, they have smarter money, they can be made more mobile. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1574.72s)]
*  So Bush was also a supporter of the Red Hat Report, which was an effort led by former FBI [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1580.72s)]
*  and CIA agents. And they were going to dig up dirt on potential people candidates that they [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1586.88s)]
*  perceived to be too progressive for their liking. So this overarching effort to install a more [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1593.3600000000001s)]
*  conservative pope has been going on for years. And that makes a lot of sense when you consider [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1599.68s)]
*  that not just with Project 2025, but the Republican agenda to push this entire country in a more, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1604.4s)]
*  not just conservative direction, but also a more religious direction. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1611.44s)]
*  They've been playing this game since at least the 80s in a very organized and focused way. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1614.8s)]
*  Also, just a quick fun fact that one of the dinners, Bush, who was of the Napa Institute, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1621.68s)]
*  he served his own line of Trinitas Cellars wine. And it was a part of his faith collection of [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1628.24s)]
*  wines with bottles retailing from $50 to $125. And really, honestly, no shade to Napa Valley, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1634.0s)]
*  no shade to their wine. I love going to Napa, but you're in Rome, they have wine. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1641.52s)]
*  I don't know if you're going to win them over with the wine. Okay, so real quick, one last thing. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1648.24s)]
*  Remember that AI generated image of Trump as the pope that he shared on social media? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1655.2s)]
*  Well, he was asked about it recently at a press conference about the backlash. And he said, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1661.6s)]
*  well, first of all, there was no backlash. Second of all, he said that Catholics loved it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1666.88s)]
*  And also, by the way, even though he shared it, he had nothing to do with any of it. So watch this. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1671.44s)]
*  So Catholics were not so happy about the image of you looking like the pope. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1676.4s)]
*  Oh, I see. You mean they can't take a joke? You don't mean the Catholics, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1682.48s)]
*  you mean the fake news media. Not the Catholics loved it. I had nothing to do with it. Somebody [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1686.88s)]
*  made up a picture of me dressed like the pope and they put it out on the internet. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1692.8s)]
*  That's not me that did it. I have no idea where it came from. Maybe it was AI, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1697.04s)]
*  but I know nothing about it. I just saw it last evening. Actually, my wife thought it was cute. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1701.76s)]
*  She said, isn't that nice? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1709.12s)]
*  It's my wife that thought it was cute. I kind of don't believe that she said that, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1710.24s)]
*  which is sad for him, I guess. But seriously, this is a very interesting story to me because, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1717.52s)]
*  as I said, I'm not Catholic, but I've found the Catholic Church very interesting [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1724.24s)]
*  for a long time, even in history classes, whenever you learn about it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1727.84s)]
*  It is a political institution, the papacy, the Vatican. It functions as a political entity. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1731.68s)]
*  Yes, it's religious, but it's also very political. And the choosing of the new pope [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1738.4s)]
*  is a very political thing. Did you see that movie Conclave? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1743.28s)]
*  Of course, I thought it was excellent. One of my favorite movies last year. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1746.96s)]
*  Yeah, I thought it was great. I didn't know what to expect when I watched it, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1750.3200000000002s)]
*  but I told you I was very interested in what goes on there. And as I said in the story, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1753.68s)]
*  the Conclave is so secretive. It was interesting to see what might be going on on the inside. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1758.4s)]
*  But what are your thoughts as a Catholic, especially seeing all this happening? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1763.68s)]
*  We kind of know that these things go on, but seeing it happen so blatantly, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1768.64s)]
*  there's this thing called America Week, which feels very icky. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1773.28s)]
*  They're not even trying to hide any of this stuff anymore. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1777.52s)]
*  I think it is important. For instance, Papa Francis, who was, again, we gotta keep this [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1779.84s)]
*  in context. For the Catholic Church, yes, this guy was considered to be a very liberal [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1788.72s)]
*  or progressive guy when he's like, all right, we'll pray over gay marriages or he'll come out [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1795.2s)]
*  and stamp his approval or suggestion that countries take in refugees from war torn areas [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1803.0400000000002s)]
*  in the Middle East, etc. He comes to a man, I think he came to San Francisco. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1811.2800000000002s)]
*  I believe it was San Francisco, could have been LA, and he goes and has lunch at the homeless [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1815.76s)]
*  shelter, right? At the soup kitchen or whatever. These are all political statements where the pope [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1822.0s)]
*  if the leader of this vast religious institution is signaling that this is what he thinks [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1829.44s)]
*  is the right thing to do, it puts pressure on other religious institutions. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1835.84s)]
*  And of course, politicians whose constituents happen to be Catholics oftentimes, right? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1839.3600000000001s)]
*  From the little bit that I've been able to read about this, apparently Pope Francis kind of [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1846.72s)]
*  like all over the institution of the Vatican, he seated it with a bunch of his own homies, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1853.36s)]
*  a bunch of progressive kind of homies. It seems like the cards are pretty much stacked against [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1859.28s)]
*  the old foggy kind of conservative wing of the Catholic Church. And so that's why you see so much [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1865.52s)]
*  saber rattling from that side of the church. They know that the odds are stacked against them [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1872.3999999999999s)]
*  in terms of getting a less quote unquote progressive pope in there. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1878.88s)]
*  But yeah, I do think on balance, for people like us who wanna see a little bit more justice [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1884.0s)]
*  and equality in our world, if the freaking pope of the Catholic Church is somebody who is broadly [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  in favor of a world that moves in that direction and doesn't demonize Muslims or Jews or people [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1895.44s)]
*  from downtrodden places of the world and suggest that we live in a more harmonious fashion [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1903.28s)]
*  as global citizens, I think that's an excellent thing that could happen. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1908.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, so we'll have to keep an eye on it. We'll see how long it takes before we have a [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1912.32s)]
*  new pope. And to your point, yeah, about 80% of the electors right now were Pope Francis appointees. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1917.84s)]
*  So it seems as though they would like for him to, would like to further his legacy. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1925.2s)]
*  All right, so we gotta move on to our next story. And this one is a rough one. So let's roll it. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1933.28s)]
*  All right, in a video posted to social media on Monday, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1957.44s)]
*  IDF soldiers can be heard as they watch as they level a building in Gaza as part of a [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1963.1200000000001s)]
*  gender reveal celebration. That's like, you can't make this stuff up. Besides the video and the [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1969.44s)]
*  apparent gender of the baby, not much is known about this incident, including if there were [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1974.64s)]
*  any injuries or casualties. But still, it goes to show how the IDF, they say that they're the most [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1979.6000000000001s)]
*  moral army in the world. But this is the level of inhumanity that we're seeing with this war. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1987.2s)]
*  So according to Heidi Matthews, a law professor at York University in Toronto, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1992.24s)]
*  we have reached the stage of genocidal fervor where new Israeli life is literally celebrated [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=1997.3600000000001s)]
*  through the destruction of Palestinian life. The Council of American Islamic Relations, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2003.52s)]
*  which is the US largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2009.6000000000001s)]
*  also condemned the event, saying in a statement, while the Israeli government slaughters and [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2014.24s)]
*  starves Palestinian babies in Gaza with the full support of our own government, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2019.92s)]
*  its occupation forces are now blowing up buildings to stage gender reveal events [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2024.88s)]
*  in celebration of the birth of their own children. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2030.0800000000002s)]
*  The inhumanity of such acts clearly demonstrates once again the brutal nature of Israel's [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2033.28s)]
*  genocidal war on Gaza and on the Palestinian people, the Israeli government must be stopped. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2038.64s)]
*  So far, the Gaza Health Ministry has reported that the death toll in Gaza has gone past 52,000. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2046.0s)]
*  And that number is probably much higher than what we know. And that includes at least 17,400 [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2053.36s)]
*  children. And since it broke the ceasefire agreement in March, more than 800 children [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2059.52s)]
*  have been killed. So this is from, okay, so five out of every 100 children in the enclave [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2064.88s)]
*  have been orphaned. And Israel's bombardment has left Gaza with the highest number of child [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2071.52s)]
*  amputees in the world and with dwindling capacity to care for them as repeated bombings and the [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2077.6s)]
*  blockade have led to a near total collapse of the healthcare system. But again, this is the most [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2082.96s)]
*  moral army in the world or that's what they keep telling us. But I feel like if they actually were, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2089.2000000000003s)]
*  they wouldn't have to keep telling us also what does that even mean a moral army. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2093.92s)]
*  But remember when Bibi said this, but way back at the beginning of the war, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2098.2400000000002s)]
*  she said the army is the most moral army in the world. Any civilian death is a tragedy and we [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2101.92s)]
*  shouldn't have any because we're doing everything we can to get the civilians out of harm's way. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2106.8s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do, minimize civilian casualties. Well, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2113.84s)]
*  they haven't been doing a great job of it. And just the fact that they're so liberal with these [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2118.7200000000003s)]
*  bombings that they're using it as a gender reveal. Just the thought, how does one come to that idea? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2123.6s)]
*  Who says, you know what, let's do a gender reveal. First of all, the worst, right? Already the worst. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2129.44s)]
*  Second of all, how does that even enter your thought? Let's do it by bombing Palestine. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2135.12s)]
*  Let's do it by bombing the places where people live. Let's do it by potentially killing other [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2140.0s)]
*  people while celebrating this pregnancy that we're having here. And congratulations on the [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2144.72s)]
*  pregnancy I get. But this is so, how can you feel happy for somebody when this is how they [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2151.76s)]
*  choose to bring that life into the world? Also, you talk about how many of these children have [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2157.28s)]
*  not only been killed, but they've been orphaned or they've been disabled and dismembered. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2163.0400000000004s)]
*  This is a generation that is being destroyed, an entire generation of children who are gonna grow [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2168.1600000000003s)]
*  up with all these disabilities, who are gonna grow up with all this instability, who are gonna [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2173.92s)]
*  grow up without families, who may not even get to grow up. We'll see how things play out. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2178.56s)]
*  But this is really, really upsetting. Was, what do you think? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2183.84s)]
*  So after the Hamas attacks on October 7th, I think with some credibility, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2187.04s)]
*  the Israeli regime could be like, you know what, we're going in there. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2197.6s)]
*  We're gonna level the place. We're gonna send ground troops. We're gonna drive Hamas [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2201.44s)]
*  out of Palestine. Victory is going to be ours, blah, blah, blah. They could say that. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2205.76s)]
*  After a year and change of nonstop, indiscriminate bombing, a complete siege, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2213.6800000000003s)]
*  leveling the place, insane amounts of civilian casualties, the mission hasn't been accomplished. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2222.0s)]
*  Hamas isn't going anywhere. The more you bomb, it's not going to change that fact. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2231.68s)]
*  And so now, after a ceasefire is negotiated, it's like, all right, let's, since we can't, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2238.24s)]
*  we haven't been able to drive you out ourselves. All right, cool. Since you cannot do that via [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2244.08s)]
*  military tactics, the logical thing is to come to a peace agreement. Cuz you clearly [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2250.3199999999997s)]
*  don't have the capacity to do it any other way or else you would have. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2256.3199999999997s)]
*  Because that was your stated goal. You have not been able to do that. Now, when you're bombing [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2261.2s)]
*  people, we know that there's no mission. There's no point to it. The point is the cruelty [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2267.3599999999997s)]
*  and the destruction in and of itself, which is so depraved, which is so dehumanizing. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2274.64s)]
*  It's just manifest and obvious, okay? You can't point to an accomplishment here. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2281.92s)]
*  And so that's why you get to the level of depravity where it's like, obviously, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2290.48s)]
*  we're not achieving any level of military or political aim. We're just trying to inflict pain [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2294.72s)]
*  on as many Palestinians as we can. And now we get to have fun with it or what we call fun [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2301.36s)]
*  by doing gender reveals with it. I mean, it's about as depraved and just awful as anything in [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2307.2s)]
*  our lifetimes to be quite honest with you. I don't even know where a precedent comes. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2315.84s)]
*  And a lot of times when you hear folks on the pro-Israel side of things talking about Hamas [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2321.84s)]
*  and they're terrorists and they're depraved, what is that besides an act of terrorism? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2329.04s)]
*  What does the word terrorism even mean these days? When you can basically indiscriminately kill [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2335.1200000000003s)]
*  50,000 civilian people over the course of your war and never have to explain why that was worth [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2342.2400000000002s)]
*  what you did. Never have to show any level of, all right, this advanced some claim or some cause. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2352.5600000000004s)]
*  I honestly really do wanna ask these people, when Al-Qaeda and Osama was like, listen, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2360.32s)]
*  the CIA who inflicted all kinds of pain and terror in our part of the world were housed [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2366.16s)]
*  in the Twin Towers. We took down the Twin Towers on September 11, therefore is justified. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2372.3999999999996s)]
*  The CIA is a military entity. We're at war with them. 9-11 is justified. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2378.48s)]
*  Nobody would agree with that logic except for only when it applies to the Israelis. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2384.24s)]
*  It is interesting because this government and this military and we have to take responsibility [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2390.4s)]
*  here because the United States is still funding the Israeli army and we're still giving them [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2400.4s)]
*  weaponry and we're still saying everything you're doing is fine, right? At most, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2404.96s)]
*  Joe Biden said, I asked him not to do this, right? Obviously, that's not enough, right? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2409.28s)]
*  If people are dying, but if you're gonna tell someone who's dying from all this, say, well, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2414.2400000000002s)]
*  at least I told them this wasn't a good idea. That doesn't do any good, right? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2418.64s)]
*  And we do have to accept responsibility that our government is funding all this stuff and [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2423.2s)]
*  it's behind all of it, but also there's a culture behind it too, right? And we did see it with 9-11. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2427.68s)]
*  That's why October 7 drew so many comparisons almost immediately to 9-11. And I was actually [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2433.6s)]
*  personally surprised to see that because a lot of Americans still don't talk about why we were [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2439.68s)]
*  attacked on September 11th the way that we were. They don't talk about how on that day in 2001, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2446.24s)]
*  so many Americans genuinely were heartbroken, of course, but were also just confused as to why [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2453.12s)]
*  any of this happened. Nobody knew why any of this happened because we had no idea what our [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2458.8799999999997s)]
*  government was doing and what our military was doing in the Middle East at the time. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2464.9599999999996s)]
*  So much so that all the things that we were doing over there that would upset them so much [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2469.52s)]
*  that they would want to attack us the way that they did. But the president just said, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2474.0s)]
*  you know what, they hate us for our freedom. They're jealous of us, basically, is what he [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2477.6s)]
*  told us and we bought it because we didn't know any better. But now 20 years later, we're seeing [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2481.12s)]
*  the same playbook rolled out and people are falling for it again. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2486.16s)]
*  Into your earlier point was, maybe right after October 7th, they could have used that excuse [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2490.96s)]
*  that, you know what, we have to defend ourselves. We have to retaliate. We have to do something, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2497.28s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. And however you feel about that argument is how you feel about it. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2501.36s)]
*  But there's no way they can stand by something like that now, right? After we've seen everything, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2507.2000000000003s)]
*  but now we're seeing that they really are just frivolously bombing places and historical places [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2513.76s)]
*  and entire families and schools and hospitals. It's getting really, really hard for them [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2520.32s)]
*  to hide behind that facade of, you know what, this is just self-defense. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2526.2400000000002s)]
*  We have to get these people out. No, you're doing gender reveals with money and bombs and [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2529.52s)]
*  weaponry that you got from the American people. So I hated covering this story. I'll say that. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2536.16s)]
*  So this was a hard one. Anyway, we gotta take our next break. We'll be right back. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2543.68s)]
*  Welcome back to The Young Turks. You've got Yaz and Woz tonight and we have one more story [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2559.52s)]
*  for you before we hand it over to the next hour. Who's on the next hour? I think you have John [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2575.04s)]
*  and Schuster, is that right? Yes, that's right. So that'll be fun. All right, so next story. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2580.16s)]
*  Let's roll the tape. You call him a child. Did you call the child the child? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2585.68s)]
*  It is my own business. You call him. Okay, why don't you have the boss say it right now again? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2593.44s)]
*  Okay. All right, that's what you say. We don't actually know for sure that the boy is five years [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2600.64s)]
*  old. That's coming from the man filming who is apparently not related to the child. In the video, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2606.3999999999996s)]
*  we appear to get a glimpse of the kid and from the glimpse anyway, he definitely looks older than [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2611.04s)]
*  five. Earlier this week, we talked about a Minnesota mom who decided to hurl racial slurs [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2616.72s)]
*  at a five-year-old after he apparently got too close to her child's diaper bag. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2625.6s)]
*  And to no one's surprise, Matt Walsh decided to come to this mom's defense [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2630.4s)]
*  while making the strangest excuses and dissecting different aspects of the video. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2634.8s)]
*  But let's watch the full video. It was filmed by Shamarke Omar, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2640.4s)]
*  who shares a Somali background with the boy again after he decided to intervene. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2644.6400000000003s)]
*  You call him a child. Did you call the child the child? It is my own business. You call him. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2650.88s)]
*  Okay, why don't you have the boss say it right now again? All right, that's what you say. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2659.6800000000003s)]
*  Nobody dig into your little kid. You call him a little child. Are you about to hit him? You [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2670.5600000000004s)]
*  chase him here. He took my son's stuff. So that gives you the right to call the child five-year-old [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2679.84s)]
*  and then would that's what he's gonna that's what you're gonna call him. That's what he's gonna act [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2685.76s)]
*  like. You know, that's a hate speech and you can do that. I don't give a. Okay, we'll see about that. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2689.84s)]
*  So that story seems pretty cut and dry. It's very obvious what was going on there. It's also very [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2699.76s)]
*  obvious which parts of the video have upset people. But Matt Walsh needed to clear up some things that [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2707.6800000000003s)]
*  were apparently inconsistent in the video. Take a look at this. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2714.4s)]
*  Now, before we continue with the story, which takes several more twists and turns, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2717.6800000000003s)]
*  we should note a few things. First of all, we don't actually know for sure that the boy is [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2722.5600000000004s)]
*  five years old. That's coming from the man filming who is apparently not related to the child. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2726.72s)]
*  In the video, we appear to get a glimpse of the kid and from the glimpse anyway, he definitely [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2731.4399999999996s)]
*  looks older than five. Omar has additionally claimed that the boy is autistic, which we also [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2736.7999999999997s)]
*  have no proof of. And we have no footage of the actual encounter between the kid and this woman. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2741.3599999999997s)]
*  Did she scream the N-word in his face? Did she mutter it under her breath? Did she say it about [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2746.3199999999997s)]
*  the child after he'd already run away? We don't know. And as far as I've seen, we haven't heard [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2751.4399999999996s)]
*  anything from the boy's parents. We don't know where they were in all of this, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2756.56s)]
*  if they were even there, which is very strange. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2761.7599999999998s)]
*  So in the original video, as well as in an interview with NBC News, here's what Omar had [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2764.72s)]
*  to say. Omar said the child had autism spectrum disorder. He said that he knows the boy's parents, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2773.04s)]
*  who he said are also from Somalia, and that they were also supervising their three other children [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2779.04s)]
*  at the park. The parents, he said, have expressed support for prosecuting the woman if possible. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2784.8s)]
*  The Rochester NAACP says the child's family had asked for privacy and they will make an official [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2790.6400000000003s)]
*  statement later today. And there's another point that we wanna make about this because [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2796.8s)]
*  Walsh says that from the little bit that we see of the boy, he looks older than five. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2801.28s)]
*  And the kid was on screen for two seconds, so I don't know. So yeah, clearly over five years old, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2807.04s)]
*  whatever. But regardless, it's still a child and that's obviously not the point. That's obviously [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2813.76s)]
*  not the thing that has people upset about the story. It's ridiculous. So Walsh continued on his [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2818.7200000000003s)]
*  defense for over 24 minutes on his show on Monday and praised the mom for her insanely popular, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2826.32s)]
*  give son go and what she's doing for, of course, it's always about free speech. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2833.84s)]
*  That some people on my side feel, to put it scientifically, icky about this whole thing. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2839.76s)]
*  I understand why they feel icky. I understand why they don't want to condone saying racial [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2849.84s)]
*  slurs to children. I don't wanna condone it either, and I don't, and nobody really does. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2855.6000000000004s)]
*  But I think they're missing the point. I don't think they understand what's actually happening [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2860.2400000000002s)]
*  here or why. It is, in the end, a net positive that this woman has raised half a million dollars. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2866.16s)]
*  I'm glad she has. I hope she raises a million. I will not be joining with some of my conservative [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2873.3599999999997s)]
*  friends in wagging my finger at her donors, and I'll explain why. First of all, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2878.56s)]
*  she does have a legitimate need for the money. The mob is truly trying to get her killed. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2886.48s)]
*  I don't believe that a woman should have her life threatened for saying a word, even a bad one. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2891.52s)]
*  And you could say freedom of speech, but not freedom from consequences for your speech, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2895.68s)]
*  all you want. But if losing your livelihood and having your house burned down [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2899.7599999999998s)]
*  is a consequence of your speech, then you do not have free speech. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2904.3999999999996s)]
*  All right, well, the campaign has raised more than what he said. It's currently raised $739,124. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2908.64s)]
*  And in the description, this is what it says. It says, my name is Shiloh, and I have been put [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2919.3599999999997s)]
*  into a very dire situation. I recently had a kid steal from my 18-month-old son's diaper bag at [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2925.2s)]
*  a park. I called the kid out for what he was. Another man who we recently found out has had [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2931.6s)]
*  a history with law enforcement, proceeded to record me and follow me to my car. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2937.92s)]
*  He then posted these videos online, which has caused my family and myself great turmoil. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2942.16s)]
*  My social security number has been leaked. My address and phone number have been given out [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2948.24s)]
*  freely. My family members are being attacked. My eldest child may not be going back to school. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2952.72s)]
*  Even where I exercise has been exposed. I am asking for your help to assist in protecting [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2959.2s)]
*  my family. I fear that we must relocate. I have two small children who do not deserve this. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2964.08s)]
*  We have been threatened to the extreme by people online. She ended by saying that she cannot and [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2970.16s)]
*  will not live in fear. The Give Son Go has raised over half of what the NAACP Rochester's branch [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2976.64s)]
*  has raised for the child and his family. And all of this is apparently one big win for Matt Walsh [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2984.72s)]
*  in his fight against cancel culture. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2990.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2993.68s)]
*  No, this is the part that I really need everyone to stop and think about. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=2994.96s)]
*  This is the most devastating attack on cancel culture that we have seen, possibly ever. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3001.4399999999996s)]
*  Shiloh Hendrix has, without really trying, effectively ended cancel culture. As Mark [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3009.8399999999997s)]
*  Dice said in his video about the incident, Shiloh is the final boss of cancel culture, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3015.04s)]
*  or maybe rather the final boss that cancel culture has to fight. And I think that's right. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3019.76s)]
*  Yeah, this isn't about cancel culture. It's about racism. That's all it is. They do all of this [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3025.44s)]
*  talking just to avoid saying the one thing that it is. And it's so obvious. He hates cancel culture [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3034.0s)]
*  so much. I have problems with cancel culture and I'm very much on the opposite side of the [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3040.4s)]
*  political spectrum from Matt Walsh. But he hates cancel culture so much that he is willing to [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3046.56s)]
*  overlook and even excuse racist behavior when he sees it. It doesn't make any sense. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3051.7599999999998s)]
*  Also, I thought it was interesting whenever he just casually spoke about the mob as if that's [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3056.16s)]
*  a thing, that's a term that his audience is used to hearing about. It's such a nebulous, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3061.52s)]
*  scary sounding thing. It's out there. He doesn't have to pinpoint or point to any mob, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3066.32s)]
*  because there is no mob. But the mob is the ones that that's the big scary [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3072.56s)]
*  thing that is coming to get all of his listeners. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3078.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think my feelings on this are a bit nuanced. Obviously, this lady did something [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3081.84s)]
*  despicable. The idea that, was the kid really five as if when you're seven, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3086.88s)]
*  you graduate into eligibility to be called an N-word. It's kind of ridiculous at the same time. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3093.04s)]
*  I'm deeply opposed to the idea that we would follow this chick to her gym, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3099.28s)]
*  or like, dox this lady. I don't think that's some kind of answer or restitution for the kid [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3104.1600000000003s)]
*  who was verbally abused at that park. I just don't believe in that sort of quote unquote justice [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3112.7200000000003s)]
*  to somebody who for all intents and purposes is just an anonymous citizen who has no power, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3121.6800000000003s)]
*  wields no influence in any way that is meaningful. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3128.48s)]
*  Now, if this is a powerful public figure, if this is somebody who actually wields power [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3132.8s)]
*  over masses of people, I'd be like, all right, cool. This is fair game. You should have to pay [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3139.84s)]
*  for something this despicable. A random person at a park who blurt out racial slurs while I find [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3146.2400000000002s)]
*  them to be contemptible. I don't think they should be attacked and killed for the rest of [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3153.6s)]
*  their lives. I don't even know that they should lose their jobs to be quite honest, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3159.52s)]
*  because it's so damn hard to pay your own rent. I don't know just saying something at a park, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3163.36s)]
*  even in anger or out of hate should have somebody losing their livelihood. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3168.7999999999997s)]
*  I think we take this thing a little bit too overboard. Matt Walsh is a clown. I mean, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3173.44s)]
*  he's just doing something obviously for clicks. He's not forwarding some kind of moral project [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3178.72s)]
*  for free speech. He's just seizing on an opportunity to seem like he's edgy and anti-woke. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3186.64s)]
*  He's corny. At the same time, I don't know that directing the hate and the anger of the mob online [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3191.84s)]
*  towards this crazy white lady does anybody any real good. I know it feels cathartic in the moment, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3201.7599999999998s)]
*  we're getting her, but nobody's life is actually made better. The cause of equality and diversity [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3207.44s)]
*  is not actually furthered by attacking this lady online and leaking her address. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3216.96s)]
*  Mm-hm. Yeah, yeah, and I think that is a good distinction that you made that this isn't any [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3221.84s)]
*  woman of consequence. I think the story itself was one thing, but then all of the conversation [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3227.36s)]
*  that came out around it really became its own entity onto itself. All of the people who are [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3235.04s)]
*  sending her money, people who were not being so thoughtful, I guess, in their reasoning behind [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3241.28s)]
*  why they were sending her money. They were sending it to her because she was racist and they liked [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3248.16s)]
*  that about her. So then that's another aspect of the story. But yeah, I know we have to wrap up [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3252.4s)]
*  this first hour, so I will leave it there. But thank you very much, Walsh, for being here with [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3257.84s)]
*  me tonight. And we're gonna hand it over to John and Schuster. See ya. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QTrJRf36vg&t=3262.56s)]
