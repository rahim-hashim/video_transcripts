Maher was joined by Tim Pool on the latest episode of his Club Random podcast, during which he noted that he first began receiving backlash from the ‚Äúfar left‚Äù over his frequent criticism of Islam."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Are Democrats SERIOUS?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA)
*  I'm like a Chicago liberal, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=0.0s)]
*  the way things have gone, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=1.9000000000000001s)]
*  especially with the woke stuff. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=3.24s)]
*  And this is where I end up in this [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=5.08s)]
*  position and so does my neighborhood. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=6.84s)]
*  I think it's interesting to see my [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=9.64s)]
*  neighborhood reflective of my [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=10.92s)]
*  politics and vice versa. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=11.96s)]
*  I think the phrase I was using last [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=12.96s)]
*  year was aggressively non common [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=15.44s)]
*  sense or uncommon sensical. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  I accent aggressively. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=20.52s)]
*  Recently, Bill Maher sat down to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=24.76s)]
*  have a conversation with Tim Pool [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=27.0s)]
*  and they happened to discuss how [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=29.68s)]
*  voters currently see the Democratic [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  Party as out of touch with average [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=34.32s)]
*  Americans. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=36.6s)]
*  This is something that's really [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=37.84s)]
*  been developing for a few years now, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=39.92s)]
*  but certainly after the last [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  presidential election and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=44.32s)]
*  the fact that a lot of blue parts [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=46.32s)]
*  of the country started to kind of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=48.6s)]
*  shift red. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=51.0s)]
*  Well, now it's become more [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=51.96s)]
*  comfortable, more comfortable [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  environment for people to kind of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=55.88s)]
*  against some of the culture on [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=58.04s)]
*  the left that's turning voters away. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=59.96s)]
*  Now, as we've covered extensively [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=61.96s)]
*  on the show, minority and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=63.92s)]
*  working class voters have been [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=65.38s)]
*  abandoning the Democrats in recent [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=67.16s)]
*  elections. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=69.24s)]
*  The party itself is pulling [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=70.44s)]
*  horribly to boot. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=72.08s)]
*  So back in March, an NBC News poll [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=73.2s)]
*  found that just over a quarter of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=75.36s)]
*  registered voters, 27%, say they [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=77.44s)]
*  have positive views of the party, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  which is the party's lowest [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=82.48s)]
*  positive rating in NBC News polling [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=84.52s)]
*  dating back to 1990. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=87.72s)]
*  Just 7% say those views are very [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=89.32s)]
*  positive. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=92.32s)]
*  So what are Democrats doing about [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  it? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=96.0s)]
*  They're gathering at luxury hotels [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  to talk about how they can throw [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  money at the problem and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=101.8s)]
*  attract male voters. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm not even kidding, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=105.08s)]
*  that's literally what they're [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=106.24s)]
*  doing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=108.08s)]
*  So here's one of their ideas. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=108.6s)]
*  The prospectus for one new $20 [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  million effort obtained by [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=112.96s)]
*  The Times aims to reverse the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  erosion of Democratic support among [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=117.72s)]
*  young men, especially online. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=120.36s)]
*  Okay, great, so they've got [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=122.84s)]
*  the funds, they're going to throw [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=124.4s)]
*  money at it, is that going to work? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=126.2s)]
*  It is code named SAM, short for [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=128.6s)]
*  Speaking with American Men, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=131.08s)]
*  a strategic plan. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  And promises investment to study [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=135.44s)]
*  the syntax, all right, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  they're going to fail. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=140.16s)]
*  It starts with study the syntax, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=142.24s)]
*  language and content that gains [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=145.28s)]
*  attention and virality in [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=147.56s)]
*  these spaces. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=149.68s)]
*  It recommends buying advertisements [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=150.8s)]
*  in video games, among other things. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=152.8s)]
*  Above all, we must shift from [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=154.72s)]
*  a moralizing tone it urges. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=156.96s)]
*  So that last part I actually 100% [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=159.88s)]
*  agree with, I don't even think you [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=162.4s)]
*  need to throw money at that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=165.0s)]
*  Just stop with the moralizing, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=167.2s)]
*  stop with the brow beating, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=169.0s)]
*  stop with the language policing, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=170.6s)]
*  and stop making young men feel like [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=172.6s)]
*  they're automatically terrible [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=174.56s)]
*  people just by the nature of them [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=176.36s)]
*  being young men. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=178.16s)]
*  And I don't know why people don't [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=179.24s)]
*  get this jank, but [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  Joe Rogan's popularity is organic. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=183.44s)]
*  They didn't throw money at Joe [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=187.68s)]
*  Rogan to make him popular. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=189.16000000000003s)]
*  Joe Rogan became popular on his own [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  without a political party [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  manufacturing him. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=194.96s)]
*  I don't know why they don't realize [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=197.16000000000003s)]
*  this, but the sooner they do [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=198.96s)]
*  realize it, the better. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=200.24s)]
*  I don't know about that, Ana, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=202.08s)]
*  but Joe Rogan has a PhD on male [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  syntax, and that's why he's done so [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  well. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=210.6s)]
*  Okay, so we're going to get into [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=212.27999999999997s)]
*  more language absurdities in a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  second when it comes to the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=216.04s)]
*  Democrats, but two things on this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=217.6s)]
*  I can name that tune for [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  $2 million, okay? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  So don't worry, Democrats, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=224.6s)]
*  come here, I'll tell you how to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  speak like a dude. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=227.72s)]
*  And you don't do it by trying to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=230.0s)]
*  figure out how American men speak. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=232.2s)]
*  You know you're American, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=235.48s)]
*  They drive me crazy, man. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=236.88s)]
*  They're so elitist, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  they can't see straight. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=239.92s)]
*  So now, the moralizing tone, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=241.56s)]
*  100%, Ana, and I'm super curious [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=243.92s)]
*  what's going to happen with the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=246.48s)]
*  rest of the left, right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=248.79999999999998s)]

*  stay away from that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=344.8s)]
*  Seems like based on the crowd [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=345.88s)]
*  sizes, a lot of Americans [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=347.48s)]
*  understand what oligarchy is. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=348.88s)]
*  But nonetheless, she contends that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  her party needs to use language [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  that comes, as she puts it, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=354.84s)]
*  from the factory line and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=356.71999999999997s)]

*  Now look, I agree with that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=360.28s)]

*  is that the faculty lounge [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=369.23999999999995s)]
*  language typically has to do with [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=371.28s)]

*  they are and what they represent. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcY0xX4PejA&t=443.52s)]
