The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Biden's DEVASTATING Diagnosis Ignites Speculation
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E)
*  Do you think that Joe Biden really [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=0.0s)]
*  would have been able to perform as [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=2.48s)]
*  president all the way through [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=4.82s)]
*  January 2029 when he would be 86? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=6.94s)]
*  Yes, I thought that back then. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=9.58s)]
*  I still think that, but [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=12.44s)]
*  I don't know that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=14.26s)]
*  Former President Biden, we've [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=15.64s)]
*  learned, has been diagnosed with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=17.6s)]
*  prostate cancer, according to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=19.52s)]
*  a statement released by his [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=21.46s)]
*  personal office just in the last [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=23.02s)]
*  five, ten minutes here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=24.86s)]
*  The former president of Biden, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=26.22s)]
*  ten minutes here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=28.26s)]
*  So as we said, a lot of Biden news. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=29.98s)]
*  Let's talk about Clyburn first, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=32.22s)]
*  hours after, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=33.94s)]
*  Representative James Clyburn [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=34.660000000000004s)]
*  telling Jake Tapper he still [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=36.5s)]
*  believed Joe Biden was fit to be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  president. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=40.02s)]
*  It was revealed that the former [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=40.82s)]
*  president was diagnosed with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=42.900000000000006s)]
*  an aggressive form of cancer. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=44.7s)]
*  Biden's office releasing this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=47.18000000000001s)]
*  statement yesterday, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=49.1s)]
*  here's what it says. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Last week, President Joe Biden was [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=51.8s)]
*  seen for a new finding of a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=54.38s)]
*  prostate nodule after experiencing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=56.22s)]
*  increasing urinary symptoms. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=58.94s)]
*  On Friday, he was diagnosed with [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=61.26s)]
*  prostate cancer characterized by [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=63.74s)]
*  a Gleason score of nine, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=66.36s)]
*  grade group five with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=68.3s)]
*  metastasis to the bone. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=69.9s)]
*  That statement from the personal [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=71.78s)]
*  office of the former president. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=74.58s)]
*  If you're unfamiliar with the term [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=77.34s)]
*  metastasis, okay, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=80.06s)]
*  I'm not good at saying it, but so [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=81.74000000000001s)]
*  I'm clearly unfamiliar. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=84.58s)]
*  It's when cancer those spreads to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=86.5s)]
*  other tissues in the body and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=88.58s)]
*  the Gleason score he was given [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  means it is likely to grow and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=92.62s)]
*  spread. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=94.62s)]
*  It goes on while this represents [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=96.34s)]
*  a more aggressive form of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=98.26s)]
*  the disease, the cancer appears to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=99.86s)]
*  be hormone sensitive, which allows [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=102.1s)]
*  for effective management. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=104.34s)]
*  President and his family are [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=106.02s)]
*  reviewing treatment options with [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=107.98s)]
*  his physicians. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=110.22s)]
*  Cenk, you'll correct me the way I [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=111.66s)]
*  pronounce it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=113.94s)]
*  There's certain words I just, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=114.94s)]
*  I don't know, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=116.66s)]
*  maybe I've given up too easily. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=117.46s)]
*  But here's the thing, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=119.3s)]
*  your initial thoughts looking for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=120.58s)]
*  that before we move forward with [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=122.58s)]
*  some reactions because a lot of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=124.42s)]
*  people weighing in a lot of people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=126.3s)]
*  not believing the timing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=128.3s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't believe the timing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=129.9s)]
*  either and I'm no one to criticize [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=132.1s)]
*  people's pronunciation of words. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=134.38s)]
*  Let's just be clear about that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=136.94s)]
*  And another fun side note, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=138.62s)]
*  climbers like he's totally fine. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=140.22s)]
*  Of course he could last another [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=142.46s)]
*  couple of years. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=143.74s)]
*  Biden's 82, Clyburn's 84. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=144.34s)]
*  That might be a part of the reason [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=147.26s)]
*  why he's saying that he thinks [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=148.7s)]
*  he's totally fine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=149.98s)]
*  He's like, I don't think he slowed [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=151.26s)]
*  down, at least according to me. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, brother, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=154.18s)]
*  because you both slowed down. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=154.9s)]
*  Anyways, back to this, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  this is important. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=157.9s)]
*  There's a lot of conspiracy [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=160.3s)]
*  theories floating around about [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=161.54s)]
*  this, but then you say conspiracy [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=162.94s)]
*  theories, but really, I mean, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=164.66s)]
*  with Biden mental decline, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=166.3s)]
*  physical decline being covered up, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=167.94s)]
*  is it conspiratorial or [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  is it just a theory, right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=171.38s)]
*  And so we'll look through some of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=172.94s)]
*  those, some of those are clearly [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=174.82s)]
*  nonsense, but then I'm going to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  tell you what might have actually [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=178.62s)]
*  happened because it's related to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=180.54000000000002s)]
*  the fact that it is hormone [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=182.62s)]
*  sensitive. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=184.38s)]
*  What is the treatment for [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  prostate cancer? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=187.3s)]
*  Well, that might be your answer, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=189.06s)]
*  but we'll get to that in a minute. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=191.1s)]
*  Sharon, back to you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=193.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's really interesting [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=194.3s)]
*  stuff, can't wait to hear more. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=196.26s)]
*  We'll get to the reactions and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=198.3s)]
*  just see what happens. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  Reactions in just a second, but [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=201.62s)]
*  let's dive a little more into [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=203.78s)]
*  the prognosis. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=205.74s)]
*  Dr. Ezekiel Manuel, who was [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=207.3s)]
*  an oncologist selected by Biden for [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  his COVID advisory board, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=211.62s)]
*  went on Morning Joe today to give [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  more insight into what the diagnosis [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=215.62s)]
*  actually means for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=217.86s)]
*  the former president, listen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  The fact is that very few people [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=221.58s)]
*  get diagnosed this advanced. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=223.5s)]
*  About 7% of all prostate cancer in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=225.74s)]
*  the country gets diagnosed when you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=227.78s)]
*  have a lesion that's in the bone and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=229.94s)]
*  therefore it's metastatic and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=232.58s)]
*  incurable. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=234.86s)]
*  The prostate cancer will not go [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=235.74s)]
*  away, he will have it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=238.06s)]
*  That doesn't mean he's going to die [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=239.78s)]
*  from it because there are a lot of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=242.06s)]
*  treatments. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=244.3s)]
*  So there's a lot there and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=245.26s)]
*  then there's chemotherapy beyond [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=246.66s)]
*  that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=248.66s)]
*  There's also treatment for [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=249.22s)]
*  that metastatic lesion near [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=250.94s)]
*  the spine if it's a threat. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=252.74s)]
*  So he has a lot of treatments and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=254.58s)]
*  he could live a long time. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=256.38s)]
*  But there's something else that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=258.7s)]
*  Dr. Manuel revealed and that is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=260.46s)]
*  that surely Joe Biden had this for [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=262.34s)]
*  a long time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=264.38s)]
*  Well, doesn't it take some time for [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=265.41999999999996s)]
*  prostate cancer to develop to point [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=268.46s)]
*  where it would spread to the bones? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=271.34s)]
*  He's had this for many years, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=275.26s)]
*  maybe even a decade growing there [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=277.74s)]
*  and spreading, that's right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=280.41999999999996s)]
*  It's a little surprising. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=283.02s)]
*  I look back at the records and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=285.53999999999996s)]
*  there's no evidence that when he [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=287.5s)]
*  got his health status and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=289.7s)]
*  the medical records were released [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=291.53999999999996s)]
*  that he had a prostate specific [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=293.98s)]
*  antigen. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=296.18s)]
*  Now, it is true that a lot of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=297.98s)]
*  people recommend not doing a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=299.7s)]
*  prostate specific antigen after 70. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=301.5s)]
*  But President Biden's been in [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=304.7s)]
*  public life a very long time. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=306.38s)]
*  He was vice president and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=308.18s)]
*  had a lot of exams under 70. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=309.74s)]
*  So it's a little surprising that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=311.5s)]
*  they didn't do it and maybe [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=313.46s)]
*  President Biden decided he didn't [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=315.02s)]
*  want to test many men do decide [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=317.1s)]
*  they don't want a PSA. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=318.86s)]
*  That's one theory in 2021 we can [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=320.98s)]
*  tell you Biden underwent a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=323.02s)]
*  colonoscopy at Walter Reed National [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=324.7s)]
*  Military Medical Center. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=327.02s)]
*  During which a single three [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=328.74s)]
*  millimeter benign appearing polyp [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  was identified and removed. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=333.58s)]
*  White House physician at the time [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=336.5s)]
*  Dr. Kevin O'Connor revealed CMBC [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=338.46s)]
*  filling in some of the details. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=340.46s)]
*  O'Connor said in a letter that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=343.06s)]
*  it was slow growing but thought to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=345.38s)]
*  be pre cancerous lesion for [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=348.38s)]
*  which no more action was required. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=351.1s)]
*  Biden had a similar polyp removed [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=354.66s)]
*  in 2008, he said. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=357.06s)]
*  However, during his last annual [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=359.22s)]
*  exam as president, Dr. O'Connor [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=361.1s)]
*  labeled Biden as a quote healthy, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=363.26s)]
*  active, robust 81 year old. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=365.62s)]
*  Biden did in fact have cancer at [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=367.94s)]
*  that time. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=370.5s)]
*  It's unclear why Biden didn't do [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=371.3s)]
*  testing for it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=374.06s)]
*  What President Biden and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=375.5s)]
*  his doctor discussed, but [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=377.14s)]
*  I think you are hinting at the other [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=378.9s)]
*  element which is that President [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=381.02s)]
*  Obama had this test, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=383.09999999999997s)]
*  President Bush had this test. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=384.46s)]
*  It is a little surprising that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=386.53999999999996s)]
*  the doctor didn't take it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=388.58s)]
*  And if he took it and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  didn't report it and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  it was elevated, that is another [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=392.58s)]
*  case of doctors not being [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=394.5s)]
*  straightforward with us. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=396.02s)]
*  We've had several of them with [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=397.58s)]
*  President Trump, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=399.62s)]
*  especially around his COVID. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  Diagnosis and if that is true, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=403.94s)]
*  that would be very troubling. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=406.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot to unpack here [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=409.5s)]
*  and that leads to the reactions [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=411.34s)]

*  physical deterioration. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=525.14s)]
*  Biden's physical deterioration, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=526.8199999999999s)]
*  most apparent in his halting walk, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=529.3s)]
*  had become so severe that there [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=531.8199999999999s)]
*  were internal discussions about [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=533.8199999999999s)]
*  putting the president in a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=535.98s)]
*  wheelchair, but they couldn't do so [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=537.6999999999999s)]
*  until after the election, one excerpt. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=540.1s)]
*  Now people such as David Axelrod [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=542.8199999999999s)]
*  are calling for [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=545.02s)]
*  the end of the Biden cover-up [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=546.14s)]
*  debate, so let's listen to Mr. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=548.22s)]
*  Axelrod. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=550.5s)]
*  As you mentioned, this comes at [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=551.22s)]
*  a time where there is so much and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=553.26s)]
*  continued attention placed on his [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=555.42s)]
*  mental acuity and stability, as [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=557.98s)]
*  well as ahead of this book release. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=560.54s)]
*  And you mentioned there's been [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=563.22s)]
*  a lot of discussion about it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=565.54s)]
*  His medical condition now, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=567.86s)]
*  his announced medical condition [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=569.74s)]
*  now, do you believe that silences [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=572.46s)]
*  or delays a lot of conversations [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=575.26s)]
*  about his last year and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=577.9399999999999s)]
*  a half of his presidency for now? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=579.9s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, I think those [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=583.02s)]
*  conversations are going to happen, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=585.9s)]
*  but they should be more muted and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=588.9399999999999s)]
*  set aside for now as he's [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=591.74s)]
*  struggling through this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=594.14s)]
*  So you heard Axelrod there, Cenk. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=596.66s)]
*  I have to be honest, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=599.62s)]
*  some of the conspiracy theories [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=601.3s)]
*  that you've heard about, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=603.9s)]
*  conspiracy theories don't seem so [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=606.9s)]
*  far-fetched to me. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=609.58s)]
*  And maybe it's not kind, but [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=611.1800000000001s)]
*  my mind went a few places when I [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=613.0600000000001s)]
*  first heard the news, certainly [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=615.0600000000001s)]
*  sympathy for the former first [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=617.34s)]
*  family, the former president. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=619.4200000000001s)]
*  But I just don't know what to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=621.86s)]
*  believe at this point, the timing, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=623.5s)]
*  the diagnosis, everything else [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=625.7s)]
*  that's swirling around. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=627.6600000000001s)]
*  So give us more on what you're [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=629.34s)]
*  zeroing in on. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=631.7s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, the thing [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=633.26s)]
*  that I don't like is people [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=635.34s)]
*  celebrating it, I can't stand that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=637.0600000000001s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=639.7s)]
*  Why? He's already gone. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=640.94s)]
*  We could have a conversation about [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=642.38s)]
*  what did they do wrong so [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=644.4200000000001s)]
*  we learn from it and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=645.9s)]
*  we don't make those same mistakes. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=647.0600000000001s)]
*  But you don't have to root against [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=649.3000000000001s)]
*  the guy's health or life. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=650.94s)]
*  I've seen a lot on the right do it, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=652.74s)]
*  I've seen some on the left do it, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=654.5s)]
*  and it's really ugly either way. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=656.22s)]
*  Okay, now, as to the relevant [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=658.22s)]
*  parts here. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=660.5400000000001s)]
*  So first of all, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=662.14s)]
*  on people's reactions as to whether [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=662.98s)]
*  they believe the Bidens. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=664.5s)]
*  I think our members speak for [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=666.1s)]
*  a lot of people. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=667.46s)]
*  So bloatedego on tyt.com wrote in, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=668.42s)]
*  if they covered up his mental [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=670.54s)]
*  decline, why wouldn't they have [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=672.22s)]
*  covered up this? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=674.02s)]
*  And that's a fair question, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=675.26s)]
*  that's a really fair question. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=676.38s)]
*  Another member on tyt.com said, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=678.06s)]
*  Don Dada Dragon said, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=680.22s)]
*  if the White House didn't dig [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=681.54s)]
*  their own lying grave, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=683.22s)]
*  I would have backed them a lot [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=684.58s)]
*  more, but now all I can say is, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=686.22s)]
*  good luck, young man. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=688.02s)]
*  So look, and you should say good [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=689.46s)]
*  luck about treating cancer and [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=691.14s)]
*  mean it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=692.86s)]
*  But in terms of the credibility of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=693.86s)]
*  the Biden team, it's a zero, right? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=695.98s)]
*  I mean, that's super fair. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=698.5400000000001s)]
*  So and whether you're left or [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=700.34s)]
*  right, it's crazy if you just [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=702.3000000000001s)]
*  believe them, they have a terrible [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=704.5s)]
*  track record. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=706.94s)]
*  So I agree with our members, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=708.0600000000001s)]
*  you can join them at tyt.com [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=709.58s)]
*  slash join. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=711.02s)]
*  So now, I talked to an expert [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=711.94s)]
*  about this. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=714.02s)]
*  So would you normally do what they [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=715.38s)]
*  call a PSA to find this out? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=717.5400000000001s)]
*  And the answer is yes, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=719.78s)]
*  definitively, yes, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=721.14s)]
*  you would normally do a PSA. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=722.3s)]
*  And is it an extra procedure that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=724.38s)]
*  could be a little invasive like [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=726.22s)]
*  a colonoscopy, so [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=727.8199999999999s)]
*  you might choose out of it? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=728.9s)]
*  No, it's part of your normal blood [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=730.3399999999999s)]
*  panel. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=731.98s)]
*  There's no reason to choose out of [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=732.62s)]
*  it at all. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=734.42s)]
*  I mean, I guess some could, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=735.42s)]
*  he could have, but if you chose to [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=737.06s)]
*  not investigate it, that might be [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=739.14s)]
*  a sign that you thought you had it [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=741.22s)]
*  and didn't want others to know it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=743.18s)]
*  So that part is already super [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=745.3s)]
*  weird, not normal, okay? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=746.98s)]
*  Now they say, but the parts that [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=749.26s)]
*  bother me about the conspiracy [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=751.06s)]
*  theories is like, you gotta get [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=752.66s)]
*  your theories right, right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=754.5s)]
*  And straight. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=756.18s)]
*  So like, Jake Tapper has a book [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=757.22s)]
*  coming out, so that's why they [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=758.9s)]
*  would want to release this. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=760.54s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=762.26s)]
*  the timing's the other way around. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=763.5799999999999s)]
*  Over the weekend, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=765.98s)]
*  everybody's beating up on Biden. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=766.9399999999999s)]
*  He went on The View and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=768.6999999999999s)]
*  he was defending himself and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=769.6999999999999s)]
*  talking about how he would have won. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=771.02s)]
*  And then that led to a round of a [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=772.86s)]
*  lot of people including a lot of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=774.18s)]
*  Democrats saying, please go away. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=775.54s)]
*  And then because of the book [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=777.6199999999999s)]
*  coming out, there's a lot more [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=779.5s)]
*  swirling around about how Biden [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=781.6999999999999s)]
*  screwed everybody over. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=784.02s)]
*  And the her tapes just came out on [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=786.54s)]
*  Friday, so it became clear that he [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=788.3s)]
*  wasn't mentally declined. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=790.18s)]
*  If you want to have people stop [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=792.0999999999999s)]
*  talking about that and [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=794.38s)]
*  how Biden was an egomaniac who [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=796.18s)]
*  cost his own party, democracy, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=798.6199999999999s)]
*  the country, etc, etc. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=801.14s)]
*  You would drop a news story about [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=803.7399999999999s)]
*  how he has cancer and so that [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=805.74s)]
*  everybody does what Axelrod did. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=807.5s)]
*  Okay, that's it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=810.1400000000001s)]
*  It's now you're not allowed to [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=811.26s)]
*  talk about it anymore because he's [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=812.62s)]
*  got cancer, right? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=814.22s)]
*  So when did they know that he had [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=815.62s)]
*  this type of cancer? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=817.7s)]
*  Of course, I don't know. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=819.7s)]
*  And that's a great question. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=821.0600000000001s)]
*  Is it a legitimate question? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=822.5s)]
*  Of course it's a legitimate [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=823.62s)]
*  question because of what I'm about [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=825.1s)]
*  to tell you, among other reasons. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=827.0200000000001s)]
*  So what is the treatment for [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=829.22s)]
*  prostate cancer? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=831.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, I looked it up, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=832.9000000000001s)]
*  it's androgen deprivation therapy. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=834.26s)]
*  And so again, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=837.26s)]
*  the expert that I talked to told me [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=838.14s)]
*  about this and he's right. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=840.3000000000001s)]
*  That's what you do, you can go on [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=843.46s)]
*  any site and confirm that. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=845.62s)]
*  Okay, well that therapy, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=848.34s)]
*  it has some side effects. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=849.5s)]
*  What are some of those side [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  effects? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=851.3000000000001s)]
*  That has some things to do with [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=851.9s)]
*  your sex life, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=853.14s)]
*  that's not relevant here because it [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=853.98s)]
*  affects testosterone, right? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=855.98s)]
*  So that's the hormones that we were [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  talking about earlier. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=859.82s)]
*  And that's why they think they [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=861.34s)]
*  might be able to treat this and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=862.46s)]
*  they might be able to survive. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=863.6999999999999s)]
*  Because you could do [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=865.1s)]
*  hormone treatment. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=865.9s)]
*  Okay, well what would the hormone [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=867.3s)]
*  treatment do? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=868.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, it would have side effects [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=869.78s)]
*  like bone thinning, which can lead [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=871.9399999999999s)]
*  to broken bones, anemia, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=874.3399999999999s)]
*  low red blood cell counts, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=876.2199999999999s)]
*  decrease mental sharpness, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=878.3s)]
*  interesting. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=880.5799999999999s)]
*  Loss of muscle mass, weight gain, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=882.06s)]
*  fatigue, increased cholesterol [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=884.66s)]
*  levels, and depression or mood [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=887.2199999999999s)]
*  swings. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=889.66s)]
*  So fatigue, your bones, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=890.98s)]
*  your bones are more brittle and [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=893.22s)]
*  that might lead you to being a [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=895.4200000000001s)]
*  little bit more careful as you walk, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=897.4200000000001s)]
*  might lead to more mishaps. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=900.02s)]
*  Depression, where you snap at [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=902.1s)]
*  people and give them some answers [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=904.62s)]
*  that are rude or however you [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=907.5s)]
*  phrase it, did Biden do that? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=910.02s)]
*  Yes, was he constantly fatigued? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=912.78s)]
*  Remember the famous memo about [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=914.46s)]
*  the president can only work between [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=916.38s)]
*  10 AM and 4 PM. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=918.4200000000001s)]
*  So we have to make sure that we get [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=919.82s)]
*  him his information then and then [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=922.0200000000001s)]
*  but otherwise, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=923.86s)]
*  we got to make sure that he rests. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=924.74s)]
*  Why did they put that memo out? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=927.1s)]
*  Is it because of the fatigue? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=928.74s)]
*  So that's not conspiratorial, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=930.5s)]
*  it's just a very simple and [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=932.5400000000001s)]
*  direct medical question. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=934.3800000000001s)]
*  So the Biden team should be asked, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=936.5s)]
*  was he on androgen deprivation [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=939.2600000000001s)]
*  therapy? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=941.7800000000001s)]
*  Because if he was, that might even [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=943.22s)]
*  explain all the things that we saw. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=944.9000000000001s)]
*  It might even explain what appeared [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=947.1800000000001s)]
*  to be mental decline, but [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=949.22s)]
*  it might have been brain fog, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=950.78s)]
*  mental fatigue, etc. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=952.54s)]
*  That they say are side effects [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=954.14s)]
*  of this drug. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=955.46s)]
*  Now I put that online and then I got [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=956.5s)]
*  attacked by the right and the left [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=958.1800000000001s)]
*  and I can't quite figure out why [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=959.74s)]
*  they're attacking me. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=961.26s)]
*  First of all, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=962.5s)]
*  you don't need to reason, it's us. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=963.1800000000001s)]
*  So it's going to happen anyway, but [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=965.42s)]
*  my point here isn't about me, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=967.02s)]
*  it's about the right wing thinks [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=968.3s)]
*  no, you're covering up his actual [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=970.02s)]
*  cognitive decline. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=971.86s)]
*  But I'm not covering anything up, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=973.1s)]
*  I'm the guy who said right from [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=974.66s)]
*  the get go, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=976.02s)]
*  there's something wrong with them. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=976.62s)]
*  And he can't be the candidate for [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=978.38s)]
*  whatever reason, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=980.26s)]
*  he can't finish sentences. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=981.42s)]
*  He's not fully there, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=983.58s)]
*  there's no question about it, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=984.66s)]
*  right? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=986.3s)]
*  So what we're trying to do is [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=987.02s)]
*  figure out what happened. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=988.62s)]
*  And when you're the president of [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=990.62s)]
*  the United States, it's super fair [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=992.02s)]
*  for people to ask what happened, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=993.74s)]
*  right? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=995.46s)]
*  And on the left, they're like, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=996.06s)]
*  you're trying to make it seem like [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=997.78s)]
*  he wasn't mentally sharp because [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=999.5s)]
*  of this drug. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1001.1s)]
*  I'm not trying to make it seem [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1002.34s)]
*  like anything. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1003.34s)]
*  I'm asking was he on that drug or [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1004.14s)]
*  was he not asking on that drug? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1005.58s)]
*  And by the way, if you're on [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1007.34s)]
*  the left and you're Joe Biden's [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1008.74s)]
*  supporter, you'd be lucky if it [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1010.3000000000001s)]
*  was this drug. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1011.9000000000001s)]
*  because then you could say, hey, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1012.62s)]
*  look, he wasn't in cognitive [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1014.1s)]
*  decline, he had cancer, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1015.26s)]
*  he shouldn't have covered it up, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1016.34s)]
*  but he took this medicine, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1017.74s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1018.9000000000001s)]
*  Is that a good excuse? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1020.0200000000001s)]
*  Not really, right? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1020.9000000000001s)]
*  Because if you're on this medicine [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1022.22s)]
*  and it produces these results, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1024.02s)]
*  I'm not even sure you should be [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1026.5800000000002s)]
*  president, but I'm positive you [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1027.66s)]
*  shouldn't run for reelection. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1028.9s)]
*  Especially when you've got it at [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1031.06s)]
*  what stage five, four, five, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1033.6200000000001s)]
*  this advanced, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1036.1000000000001s)]
*  you release a score of nine, and [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1037.38s)]
*  you're running for president? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1039.42s)]
*  No, that's why they release it [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1041.46s)]

*  maybe they did, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1045.9s)]
*  that's not impossible. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1046.9s)]
*  But given the weight of the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1049.2600000000002s)]
*  evidence of all of their previous [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1050.8200000000002s)]

*  this up. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1058.42s)]
*  If they were just being honest [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1059.0200000000002s)]

*  Yeah, what you've uncovered in [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1065.26s)]
*  talking to the doctor today too, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1067.34s)]
*  I mean, it makes perfect sense. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1069.62s)]
*  I tend to lean in that direction, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1071.54s)]
*  having heard the theory, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1073.54s)]
*  the balance of it, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1075.34s)]
*  it makes perfect sense. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1076.7s)]
*  I guess I'm wondering this, look, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1078.74s)]
*  I've been super irked by all of [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1081.18s)]
*  the news about the secrets, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1083.34s)]
*  the lies. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1085.34s)]
*  Maybe I'm just naive in this day [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1086.06s)]
*  and age about what a modern day [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1088.38s)]
*  White House kept from us with [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1090.5s)]
*  the media's assistance. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1092.5s)]
*  But I guess the larger issue I've [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1096.3s)]
*  heard people raise, Cenk, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1098.74s)]
*  is why does it matter? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1100.94s)]
*  Why does it matter now? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1102.74s)]
*  Why does it matter? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1104.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's actually [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1106.8600000000001s)]
*  a great question, Sharon. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1107.8600000000001s)]
*  So going forward, when it comes to [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1108.74s)]
*  how we view Joe Biden, maybe it [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1111.58s)]
*  matters for history's sake, but [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1114.18s)]
*  I don't really care about that [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1116.74s)]
*  at this point. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1118.6200000000001s)]
*  We got way too many issues to worry [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1119.6200000000001s)]
*  about how history sees Joe Biden. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1121.18s)]
*  Do I care about Joe, Jill, and [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1123.14s)]
*  Hunter Biden now? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1124.78s)]
*  No, I don't care about them at all. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1126.0600000000002s)]
*  So they're not going to be relevant [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1128.3s)]
*  politically, they're not going to [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1129.8200000000002s)]
*  run for any office. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1131.18s)]
*  It's like am I sitting there [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1132.3400000000001s)]
*  obsessing about what [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1133.42s)]
*  Chelsea Clinton's up to? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1134.0600000000002s)]
*  No, I don't care at all, right? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1135.02s)]
*  So then what is the part that is [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1137.3400000000001s)]
*  relevant? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1139.3s)]
*  For me, the only part that's [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1139.8600000000001s)]
*  relevant is, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1141.46s)]
*  Democratic leadership always tells [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1142.26s)]
*  you don't believe your lying eyes. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1144.38s)]
*  It looks like our candidate is [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1146.6200000000001s)]
*  weaker than the other Democrats in [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1148.42s)]
*  primary, but we know some secret [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1150.58s)]
*  information that the establishment [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1152.62s)]

*  Don't believe the polls, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1158.6599999999999s)]
*  don't believe anything. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1159.86s)]
*  You've got somebody that looks like [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1161.1s)]
*  they're very pro establishment and [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1163.3s)]
*  takes tons of money from the banks [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1165.5s)]
*  like Hillary Clinton did. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1167.5s)]
*  And but no, taking millions of [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1169.34s)]
*  dollars from the banks, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1171.06s)]

*  mental decline and [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOPQ0zxY81E&t=1185.66s)]
