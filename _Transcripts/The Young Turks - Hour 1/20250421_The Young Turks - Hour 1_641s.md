# Markets FREEFALL After Trump Calls Fed Chair Jerome Powell A 'Loser'
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg)
*  He wrote, quote, Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always too late and wrong, he said [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=0.0s)]
*  in all caps, yesterday issued a report which was another and typical complete mess. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=4.66s)]
*  He went on to say that Powell's termination could not come fast enough. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=9.36s)]
*  You've reiterated that you intend to stay in office until the end of your term, and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=13.96s)]
*  that certainly reassured many in financial markets. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=19.48s)]
*  Our independence is a matter of law. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=22.36s)]
*  Congress has, in our statute, we're not removable except for cause. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=25.28s)]
*  Well, the stock market was in free fall again today after President Donald Trump called [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=29.96s)]
*  his own Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, a loser. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=35.4s)]
*  Now, Trump is very upset with Powell because of the fact that Powell is unwilling to lower [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  interest rates. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=45.08s)]
*  In fact, in a recent update that we received from Powell, he basically cited that Trump's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=46.08s)]
*  tariffs policy is very likely going to lead to more inflation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  And as a result of that, the Federal Reserve is unwilling to lower interest rates, which [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=56.32s)]
*  is something that Trump really, really wants Powell to do, Cenk. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=60.72s)]
*  Yeah, he better be careful what he wishes for. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=64.2s)]
*  So lowering the interest rates stimulates the economy. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=66.72s)]
*  And Trump is, in his first term, pressured the head of the Federal Reserve to lower interest [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=70.68s)]
*  rates over and over again. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=75.2s)]
*  And look, we were headed in that direction anyway, and they did, right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=77.08s)]
*  So you can't tell if they respond to pressure or if they were going that way. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=81.16s)]
*  So did it help his economic numbers? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=84.54s)]
*  Immensely. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=87.66s)]
*  But when you're worried about inflation, lowering the interest rate is the exact wrong move [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=88.66s)]
*  because it could overstimulate the economy and leading to higher prices. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=94.18s)]
*  But now with the tariffs, we're already risking going back into inflation pretty significantly. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=97.94s)]
*  If you lower the interest rates, that's a double whammy and could actually destroy the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=103.64s)]
*  economy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=107.58s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=108.58s)]
*  So Powell is doing what he's supposed to do. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=109.58s)]
*  We got issues with the Federal Reserve overall, but as a chair here, he's supposed to balance [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=111.12s)]
*  inflation and unemployment and come to a number that's best for the economy and do that objectively [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=117.44s)]
*  and not based on the political whims of the president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=122.64s)]
*  And he is absolutely doing his job. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=125.2s)]
*  The reason the market went down nearly 1,000 points today is because one of the things [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=127.2s)]
*  that is true is that the market thinks Powell was doing a good job and he's a good steward [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=131.44s)]
*  of the economy because he's been now through a couple of presidents. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=137.08s)]
*  And he's done a pretty good job of modulating the interest rates in a professional way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=140.78s)]
*  And they're worried that if Trump gets rid of him and puts in some dumbass lackey, that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=146.68s)]
*  it's gonna absolutely destroy the markets. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=151.84s)]
*  So that's why the market headed south again today. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  By the way, Trump was warned about this by some of his top advisors. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=156.8s)]
*  And as usual, he didn't listen. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and also, I mean, when you think about the tariffs, if Trump really does go forward [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=162.24s)]
*  with some of the more astronomical tariffs against our trade partners. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=167.56s)]
*  And by the way, that is on top of the 10% baseline tariff that he's slapping onto every [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=172.44s)]
*  country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=177.28s)]
*  It's going to lead to unemployment too. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=178.6s)]
*  It's not just gonna be inflation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=181.92s)]
*  There are companies within the United States that rely on foreign made parts or foreign [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=184.72s)]
*  products in order to run their business here in the United States. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=189.0s)]
*  And if they can't afford those products because of the high tariffs, or if their customers [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=193.2s)]
*  aren't willing to bear the financial burden of the inflation that comes along with those [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=198.04s)]
*  tariffs, they're gonna go out of business and that's gonna increase unemployment. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=203.76s)]
*  And that's like a crazy combination of higher unemployment, yet you also have inflation [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=208.52s)]
*  that remains and could get worse. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=214.96s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why everybody's so worried about a recession, because Trump [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=217.82s)]
*  is flirting with stagflation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=221.54s)]
*  That's when you do the nearly undoable of getting bad unemployment numbers and bad inflation [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=223.85999999999999s)]
*  numbers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=228.29999999999998s)]
*  Which by the way, I mean, he already did the undoable in the markets by getting the stock [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  market and the bond market to drop at the same time, which was previously thought unimaginable [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  because they balance each other out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=238.22s)]
*  When you take money out of one, you usually put it in the other. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=239.9s)]
*  But people took it out of both markets because they're so worried about the instability that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  Trump is bringing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=246.62s)]
*  And also, I mean, look, this game of chicken with China has not really looked so great [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=247.7s)]
*  for Trump so far. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=252.66s)]
*  I think there was this assumption that President Xi in China was going to cave to Donald Trump's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=253.82s)]
*  demands that has not happened yet. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=259.38s)]
*  It doesn't appear that he's going to bend at any point. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  He could, you never know what the future holds, but things aren't looking good in regard to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  these negotiations with China. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=268.62s)]
*  Now with that in mind, today Trump posted this on Truth Social and that's what led to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=271.02s)]
*  the freefall in the stock market. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=276.42s)]
*  He wrote preemptive cuts in interest rates are being called for by many, meaning many [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=279.18s)]
*  want the Fed to lower interest rates. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=284.78s)]
*  With energy costs way down, which is true except for the case of California, food prices, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=287.58s)]
*  including Biden's egg disaster substantially low. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=293.5s)]
*  I know, I know, it's ridiculous. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=296.02s)]
*  Look, we didn't hammer Trump over the egg prices because it was avian flu and he doesn't [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  have control over that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=303.65999999999997s)]
*  To the extent that people want to make it seem. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=304.74s)]
*  And as usual, we were fair and honest about Biden's inflation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=311.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=312.26s)]
*  So was that all Biden? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=313.26s)]
*  No, in fact, Biden handled it better than most of the rest of the world, partly because [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=314.26s)]
*  of Jerome Powell, by the way. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=317.5s)]
*  And they worked in tandem. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=319.3s)]
*  So we didn't hammer Trump over it because we're fair. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=320.3s)]
*  But then you want to blame it on Biden? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=322.98s)]
*  Biden has nothing to do with the egg prices. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=324.54s)]
*  That makes you look like an ignoramus. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  He says there's virtually no inflation right now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=328.82s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  There's going to be a slowing of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, he's referring to Jerome [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=333.34s)]
*  Powell there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=337.38s)]
*  A major loser lowers interest rates now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=338.38s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=341.46s)]
*  Powell has always been too late except when it came to the election period when he lowered [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=342.46s)]
*  interest rates in order to help sleepy Joe Biden, later Kamala get elected. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=347.5s)]
*  How did that work out? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  So Trump's post, again, followed an earlier post in which he called for Powell's termination. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=353.17999999999995s)]
*  And I want to just briefly talk about that because due to congressional legislation that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=359.1s)]
*  was passed earlier, the Federal Reserve is a separate independent body and the president [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=364.18s)]
*  cannot fire the chair. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=370.66s)]
*  Now, I should note that in Trump's first term, he was the one who tapped Jerome Powell to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  be head of the Federal Reserve. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=377.3s)]
*  But since he can't manipulate him like a nice little puppet, Trump soured on him and wanted [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=379.38s)]
*  to fire him in his first term, didn't succeed in that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=384.72s)]
*  And now he's kind of bringing this issue back up. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=387.54s)]
*  But look, there is a Supreme Court case that could eventually lead to Trump having the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=390.66s)]
*  ability to fire Jerome Powell. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=396.70000000000005s)]
*  So I want to get to that case and here's an explanation of it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=398.42s)]
*  Tell me about the case in front of the Supreme Court that might change that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=402.3s)]
*  Well, it involves the National Labor Relations Board, which is another one of those so-called [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=405.14000000000004s)]
*  independent federal agencies where Congress has specifically restricted the president [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=409.22s)]
*  from firing or removing members. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=413.82000000000005s)]
*  Trump did it anyway, so one of the members sued. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=416.18s)]
*  Now Trump argues that he has the power to do this under the Constitution, that these [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=419.42s)]
*  are agencies that perform executive functions. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=423.1s)]
*  He's the head of the executive branch, and so Congress can't restrict him from removing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=426.02s)]
*  these members. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=430.86s)]
*  And I will say, looking back to cases in the past 15 years, there has been some sympathy [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=431.86s)]
*  by some of the justices for those arguments. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=437.7s)]
*  Now how does this case affect the Fed? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=440.54s)]
*  Well, it's a similarly structured agency. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=443.18s)]
*  So there is real concern that if the court agrees to take up this case, and certainly [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=445.9s)]
*  if Trump wins, then that also could suggest that he could get rid of Jerome Powell as [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=450.58s)]
*  head of the Fed. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=455.82s)]
*  So a lot could really hinge on whether the Supreme Court hears that case and how they [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=457.78s)]
*  rule on that case. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=461.94s)]
*  It could, again, negatively impact Jerome Powell's role as head of the Federal Reserve. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=463.29999999999995s)]
*  But nonetheless, Trump doesn't like independent government agencies. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=468.41999999999996s)]
*  He wants to have control over everything. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=471.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, this is a big problem. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=473.34000000000003s)]
*  So here the Supreme Court could go in the wrong direction. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=475.74s)]
*  And so we'll have to see how that plays out. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=480.1s)]
*  But the reason it'd be a huge problem is because every president, and this one is definitely [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=482.02s)]
*  not just Trump or the Republicans, is gonna wanna pick a Fed chair that's going to stimulate [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=486.0s)]
*  the economy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=492.02s)]
*  But the problem is when you stimulate it on your watch, sometimes it blows up on the next [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=493.26s)]
*  guy, right? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=496.78000000000003s)]
*  So it's a deeply irresponsible but also nearly irresistible way of controlling the markets [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=497.86s)]
*  and the economy. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=503.5s)]
*  So a president is going to voluntarily not use that power to stimulate the economy, even [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=504.98s)]
*  if it's overstimulating, especially in his last two years, when he's not likely to feel [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=509.38s)]
*  the brunt of it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=514.34s)]
*  And he could pretend, and his party can pretend all along, when we were in charge, everything [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=515.34s)]
*  was great. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=519.1800000000001s)]
*  So it's a really bad idea to go in this direction. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=520.32s)]
*  And lastly for me, Trump, calling the head of the federal chair, head of the Fed, a major [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=525.38s)]
*  loser, who does that? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=534.3s)]
*  I don't know when Maca's gonna get tired of him being a child. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=536.26s)]
*  Maybe the answer is never, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=539.42s)]
*  Or independence that voted for Trump, more importantly. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=541.02s)]
*  Come on, guys, what is this? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=544.3s)]
*  What is like- [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=545.62s)]
*  I don't mind, but look, I don't like that he's attacking Jerome Powell for the reason [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=546.62s)]
*  he's attacking Jerome Powell. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=552.1s)]
*  And I've had my issues with monetary policy under Jerome Powell's leadership for sure. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=553.52s)]
*  But nonetheless, I don't care if he calls him a loser. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=557.72s)]
*  I get it, it seems childish compared to what- [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=559.4s)]
*  So I've said a million times, I don't mind him doing the intimidation and the bullying. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=562.68s)]
*  That's part of politics and that's hardball. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=567.02s)]
*  And I've given him credit for that and you wanna attack your political opponents, etc. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=569.36s)]
*  But when you call the head of the federal reserve, major loser, it's so stupid and childish. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  And by the way, that's what makes the markets partly jittery, right? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  Because they're like, the president's a frickin' child. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=583.24s)]
*  And so whether you like it or not, there's also tons of foreign investors in the stock [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=586.64s)]
*  market, right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=591.08s)]
*  And once they see that our president is a buffoon, they get worried and they start withdrawing [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=592.4s)]
*  money from America. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=597.76s)]
*  So you can say, hey, I don't care about corporations. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=599.54s)]
*  Hey, you know me, I got a thousand problems with corporations, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=601.92s)]
*  And the structure of the Federal Reserve has huge issues that we've talked about on other [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=606.6s)]
*  shows, right? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=611.48s)]
*  But when a president does this kind of third grade stuff, it's unnerving. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=612.8s)]
*  Yeah, I get it, yeah, I agree. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=619.0s)]
*  So we'll see how this plays out, but Jerome Powell remains defiant. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=622.8s)]
*  He is resisting calls to step down. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=626.8s)]
*  He will not resign. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=628.88s)]
*  And we'll see how it plays out for him. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=630.68s)]
*  I'm super curious to see who wins in this battle. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB5c6d0ikAg&t=631.8399999999999s)]
