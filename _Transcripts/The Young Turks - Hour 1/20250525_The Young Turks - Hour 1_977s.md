The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Does This Poll Change Everything?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU)
*  Don't let them trick us into thinking we are enemies. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=0.0s)]
*  Don't let them trick us into thinking we can be separated into rural and urban, black and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=4.0s)]
*  right and Latino, we are one. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=9.68s)]
*  Miracles start with mustard seeds. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=12.0s)]
*  And that is what each and every one of you represent today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=15.0s)]
*  Small miracles of faith in ourselves, in each other, and in the refusal to give up. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=20.0s)]
*  Well, that's a snippet of a video that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez released [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=29.72s)]
*  just last month. And it has been seen by many as a sign that she intends to run for president in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=34.92s)]
*  2028. Cenk, do you think that's the case? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=42.28s)]
*  So look, we did a poll on the website tyt.com. Should she run for Chuck Schumer's seat [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=45.4s)]
*  or run for president? So what's she gonna do? I have no insider knowledge. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=52.84s)]
*  What do I think she should do? I think she should primary Schumer. I agree with [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=57.56s)]
*  our viewers at tyt.com. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=62.52s)]
*  Nice. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=64.04s)]
*  So we'll talk about the upsides and downsides of both. But there's something she could do that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=65.16s)]
*  would be super helpful in getting the movement further along. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=71.0s)]
*  Now, according to a new poll that was released by Coefficient, AOC is the face of the Democratic [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=76.84s)]
*  Party. In fact, it's not even close. Take a look at this. So 26% of respondents said that AOC is, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=83.64s)]
*  in fact, the face of the Democratic Party. She's tied with no one. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=89.88s)]
*  Honestly, I fall in the no one category. I don't know if she's really the face of the Democratic [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=96.36s)]
*  Party. It's leaderless at the current moment. So I guess I don't think there's a current leader. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=101.64s)]
*  In terms of face of the Democratic Party, maybe. But she's, so in third place is Other with 22% [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  of the votes. After that comes a list of high profile Democrats. And we'll list them from most [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=117.0s)]
*  to least votes in this poll. So starting with Bernie Sanders, then Jasmine Crockett, Kamala Harris, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg, who actually tied with Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=132.28s)]
*  Cory Booker, and in last place, luckily, Gavin Newsom. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=135.39999999999998s)]
*  So you gotta like that, Ana. Bernie's at 12% and Gavin's at 2%. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=139.32s)]
*  Yummy in my tummy. Mismanaged taxpayer revenue in the state of California, so poorly, I mean, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=144.44s)]
*  so badly that he's now cutting benefits in the state's Medicaid program. And on top of that, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=151.64s)]
*  he wants Medicaid recipients in the state to pay $100 a month premium. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=158.12s)]
*  He's a scumbag. Go ahead, Cenk. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay, that was random. So no, look, the party clearly has no leader now and that's not a bad [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=165.4s)]
*  thing. That's what primaries are for. And this is the time to prove yourself. So Bernie and AOC have, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=173.0s)]
*  in a sense, gone out there and taken the lead. And I love that they took the initiative. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=181.4s)]
*  And they proved that they're popular by having 20,000, 30,000, 36,000 people show up at these [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=186.12s)]
*  rallies. Now she's doing great in the polling and that makes a lot of sense. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, what she's gonna do with it is the next question. And what direction is she gonna go, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=199.16s)]
*  both politically and policy-wise, right? So policy-wise, keep it real, I think she did [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  too much culture wars in the past. Agreed, yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=209.48s)]
*  But now she seemed to be signaling that she's not gonna do culture wars anymore. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=211.56s)]
*  And because she's such a star, a lot of people on the left are saying, that's okay. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=215.72s)]
*  We love culture wars and we wanna do it. But if you're not doing it, we still [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=220.27999999999997s)]
*  are gonna cheerlead for you. Great, no problem, no problem, okay? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  Why are you under the impression that she's moving away from culture wars? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  I saw interviews where she did very long word salads that at the end meant, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm not doing culture wars anymore, okay? And hosts who love culture wars were like, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  my god, you're so brilliant for saying that. That's amazing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=245.0s)]
*  Okay, all right. But I'll take it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=248.84s)]
*  I'll take it too, absolutely, yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=250.44s)]
*  I just want people to go in the right direction. So an AOC, when she's focusing on economic [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=252.28s)]
*  populism, is a very good spokesperson for that. So that's terrific. So that's good news that she's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=258.12s)]
*  headed in the right direction. Now in terms of the politics, electoral politics, my god, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=262.92s)]
*  on seating Schumer and becoming a senator from New York would be enormously helpful. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=269.0s)]
*  Cuz you need someone in the Senate to be able to keep introducing this legislation. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=274.2s)]
*  And you need momentum in the Senate. So it's been Bernie by himself for so long. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  And then you had Elizabeth Warren, who half supported his policies, at least in the Senate. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  And kinda Merkley, we stretch and stretch to find anyone else who might help. So having AOC there [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=287.88s)]
*  would be powerful. And then you get rid of Chuck Schumer. And by the way, if she runs, Schumer will [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=294.84s)]
*  retire. He's not gonna get embarrassed on Lucy's right now. She's at 55% against Chuck Schumer. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=299.96s)]
*  Yeah, whether she intends to run for that Senate seat or for president, either in 2028 or in the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=306.44s)]
*  future, I would say the biggest piece of advice I would give AOC is to get herself a good foreign [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  policy advisor. Cuz that's the area where she flails quite a bit and gets a lot of backlash [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=321.88s)]
*  from the left specifically. Yeah, I don't think that it's an advisor. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=329.4s)]
*  I think what she's trying to do is if I locate our jobs to be honest. So I think she's trying to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=333.08s)]
*  walk the line. Don't walk the line. So and I think that that's a mistake. That's why I think running [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  for president is not a great idea. I don't think she's gonna win and then we lose a Senate seat for [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=342.76s)]
*  no reason and have a corporatist like Chuck Schumer. And she could be a perfectly great senator. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=347.96s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. But if she tries to walk the line, what she's gonna do is [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=353.0s)]
*  what she did at the DNC. My God, establishment Democrats are great. Kamala Harris is wonderful [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=359.0s)]
*  on Gaza. My God, I'm good friends with everyone in the Democratic Party. And if you guys are [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=364.84s)]
*  pro Israel's genocide, I'm not for it. But hey, I think it's great that you guys are for, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=370.84s)]
*  no, don't do that. Don't do that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=376.2s)]
*  Don't do that, right? And it isn't about Israel and Gaza. It's about authenticity. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=377.24s)]
*  And so do you have an actual opinion and are you gonna fight for it? So that's always been my top [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=382.28s)]
*  concern. And so no advisor is gonna help her through that. If she wanted the right advisors, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=387.08s)]
*  she would have just kept the co-founders of the Justice Democrats, not me, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  Shortcut and Corbyn Trent. Those are the guys who helped her win the race. Those are the guys who [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=397.08s)]
*  helped put Green New Deal on the map and help her with her career. But she's not gonna go [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  back to them because the establishment would be mad at her and she wants to walk the line. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=406.76s)]
*  So believe it or not, James Carville, of all people, was asked about the poll that we just [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=412.12s)]
*  shared details about. And he's not really a fan of AOC, as we've previously shared with you. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=418.36s)]
*  But even he admitted that if push came to shove, he'd support her. Take a look. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=424.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think the party is in near as bad shape as being betrayed to be. Look, we lost the election. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=431.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't like the party. I don't blame the party reputation for being low. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=438.76s)]
*  But I think that if AOC wants to run for president, she gets to nominate. And God bless you, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=443.08s)]
*  you are the leader of the Democratic Party. Whoever gets that nomination is gonna be it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=449.08s)]
*  And that's all I'm waiting for. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=453.24s)]
*  Well, here we backed into some intra-party news. You heard it here first. James Carville [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=454.84s)]
*  wants a critic of the AOC podcast landscape now says, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  if you win, you win and you got his support. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=465.4s)]
*  And look, conservatives are worried, believe it or not. Okay, they're concerned about her charisma [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=467.32000000000005s)]
*  and her fundraising prowess and how she could be a serious contender in 2028. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=477.0s)]
*  If you don't believe me, I'll show you the proof. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=482.6s)]
*  But I would watch out for her. I mean, she's pulling in tens of thousands of people. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=484.36s)]
*  Quarter one. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=488.76000000000005s)]
*  And raising a lot of money. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=489.32000000000005s)]
*  Yes, quarter one, two times any other quarter amount she'd raised at 9.6 million. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  She was already a prolific fundraiser. She's out raising herself now. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=495.32s)]
*  She raised the most money of any member in Congress in the last quarter. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=497.88s)]
*  She's getting the biggest crowds. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=502.04s)]
*  I've always said, do not underestimate. People write me, by the way, they think that I support [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=503.72s)]
*  AOC. I don't like AOC, but I can recognize raw talent. Raw political talent when I see it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=509.0s)]
*  AOC is a person who understands her base, who understands the leftist populist streak that runs [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  through that party. Bernie and AOC, I think have learned from the last four or five years in politics [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=524.44s)]
*  and are not leading with identity messaging in a way that I think AOC genuinely did struggle with. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=529.8000000000001s)]
*  Ryan documents that in some of his book. That really was a stumbling block for some [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=535.96s)]
*  left populists. But I think, and maybe the right is underestimating this, they have learned from that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=540.44s)]
*  Look, I really hope that is the case. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=548.9200000000001s)]
*  Cuz honestly, at this point, it's not just about Republicans. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=551.88s)]
*  It's about Democratic voters who are sick and tired of the identity politics. I find [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=555.32s)]
*  it repulsive at this point. I do, I'm repulsed by it. Sorry. All it's done is divide this country [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=559.48s)]
*  in the worst possible ways. Fractured the Democratic base significantly. Essentially taught people [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=566.2s)]
*  within the same party to hate each other. It's insane. So if they've learned those lessons, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=573.72s)]
*  I really hope that's the case and she'll have my backing entirely. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=579.64s)]
*  Well, one upside of if she's a candidate is then the radical left that said no, you have to be [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=583.64s)]
*  maximalist and you have to agree with the most extreme ideology 100%. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=593.8s)]
*  They're gonna lose it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=598.84s)]
*  No, no, no, they're not. What's gonna happen is cuz they're ass kissers. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=600.28s)]
*  So what's gonna happen is when AOC says we're not doing that in any politics anymore, they're like, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=604.12s)]
*  we never liked identity politics. What's with all this transport stuff? There's only 10 people in [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=609.08s)]
*  the NCAAs that are transgender. Because as long as the leader is saying it, and AOC is saying it, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=613.8000000000001s)]
*  we love it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=620.76s)]
*  Okay, we have to make note of the time and date of this prediction in case it comes true. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=621.24s)]
*  Because if it does come true, that would be hilarious. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=626.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you right now, I know those guys. Those guys are like, hey, if I think I can gain [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=630.0400000000001s)]
*  something, I'll attack someone. If I think I can gain someone, I'll kiss someone's ass, right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=635.08s)]
*  Totally. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=639.88s)]
*  I mean, just think about- And they'll pretend, by the way, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=640.2800000000001s)]
*  they'll pretend they were never for identity politics. It's gonna be awesome. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=642.2s)]
*  Just think about the most vociferous Kamala Harris supporters in the last election cycle. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=646.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing because they really care about what's happening in Gaza. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=652.84s)]
*  Until Kamala Harris, who's part of the Biden administration, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=660.2s)]
*  which oversaw the slaughter of tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, is running for president. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=663.32s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm gonna get back to AOC in a second. But I just wanna be clear, I'm saying this every [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  time now. When I say radical left, it's some from the far left and some from the former moderates, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=672.7600000000001s)]
*  right? The Radlibs. And so the Radlibs and some of the far left agree on identity politics. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=677.32s)]
*  So the Radlibs will be like, yeah, Kamala's positions might be bad, but she's a black [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=683.24s)]
*  woman, okay? So you're not allowed to disagree with her. Shut your mouth, right? That kind of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=687.8000000000001s)]
*  nonsense. They're the same group. Yeah, so whatever. But the minute that you've got someone in power [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=693.08s)]
*  in the Democratic Party, those are exactly the people that will rally and go, you know what? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=700.6s)]
*  You're not allowed to do identity politics anymore because a Latina woman, I mean, a Latinx, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=705.64s)]
*  no, we're not doing that anymore. A Latina has said that we're not doing it anymore, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=710.6s)]
*  so you're not allowed to do it, okay? I guarantee it, I guarantee it. So anyways, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=714.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't think she's gonna be the candidate, so we're not gonna get to see that, although [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=719.08s)]
*  it would be beautiful, okay? But you can cross our fingers. It's got me rooting for AOC on that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=721.88s)]
*  count. All right, now, back to AOC at its core. I agree with Carville. Whoever wins, wins, right? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=727.72s)]
*  And Carville is the kind of guy who wants to win, right? And so I think he means it, that if AOC [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=736.52s)]
*  wins, then that's our Democratic candidate and I want Democrats to win. I don't think that's a [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=743.96s)]
*  controversial comment, right? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=748.6s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=750.12s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, I'm not canceling AOC over her DNC speech, right? So- [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=751.08s)]
*  Oh, I hold it against her. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=757.24s)]
*  I hold it, yeah. I didn't like it, right? And it's a mark against her, but that doesn't define our [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=759.24s)]
*  whole career. We don't want people canceling folks based on disagreements, so then we've [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=767.5600000000001s)]
*  got to do likewise, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=774.44s)]
*  But also a line that the Radlibs love, be better. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=775.8800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, on that issue, obviously be better, but then she in the beginning, she was one of the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=783.8000000000001s)]
*  first to speak out for Palestinians. So it's a mixed bag, guys. Let's be fair to everyone, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=787.4000000000001s)]
*  okay? And then the right wing, I think that they're half trolling, right? I think they're [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=792.36s)]
*  thinking, yeah. No, no, I think they're half of them are mean it, and some of them ones that we [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=798.84s)]
*  showed. But half of them are like, yeah, pick AOC, we're gonna beat her. And I'm like, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=803.0s)]
*  you better be careful what you wish for. Especially if she's left identity politics [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=807.8s)]
*  and she just goes to economic populism, that's a winning strategy. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=812.04s)]
*  She needs more runway. So I do think that if she ran for president in 2028, it would be a tough hill [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=815.16s)]
*  to climb because there's not enough runway to escape the identity politics identity that she [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=821.08s)]
*  took on over the last few years. It's kinda like Kamala Harris. It's like you fed into [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=828.52s)]
*  a lot of that crap, especially in 2020 and beyond. Just because you've decided to stop [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=835.0799999999999s)]
*  messaging on that stuff in the three months you ran for president doesn't mean that [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=843.3199999999999s)]
*  it's enough time for that message to get across to people. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=847.3199999999999s)]
*  And obviously, it brings up an issue of authenticity, right? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=849.72s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=853.0799999999999s)]
*  Because when Anna said I prefer to be called a woman and not a birthing person, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=853.72s)]
*  everybody flipped out. It's like nobody ever says birthing person anyway. AOC did on CNN. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=858.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=863.08s)]
*  So she was the one saying on the issue of abortion, we should just call them birthing people. And she [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=863.72s)]
*  did on CNN. So now you're gonna walk that back. I'm glad you're walking it back, but I do wonder [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=870.12s)]
*  why you're walking it back, right? But anyways, I always take yes for an answer. So lastly, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=875.8000000000001s)]
*  on establishment media, so far they've been fangirling her. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=883.72s)]
*  And if you're wondering why, when they certainly didn't do that for Bernie and they haven't done [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=887.72s)]
*  that for any other progressive, cuz they also see her walking the line, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=892.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh, totally. I'm a little worried about that, actually. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=897.4s)]
*  Okay, that goes to my point here. That's why I'm not being like, yay, AOC, hold on, let's see. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=901.32s)]
*  Because I remember when I was back in Obama in 2008, right, against Hillary Clinton in the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=907.08s)]
*  primaries. I was shocked that mainstream media was totally open to it. Cuz normally they'd be [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=912.12s)]
*  like, Hillary, Hillary's God, the Clintons are God, establishment is God. And they were totally [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=917.5600000000001s)]
*  open to Barack Obama. And I was like, that's a curious ally, but I'll take it, right? But it [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=921.88s)]
*  turns out they knew something I didn't know. Maybe they knew about the Citibank bribes. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=927.48s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know about that. But I do know that they had a sense that Barack Obama wasn't [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=931.72s)]
*  gonna bring you real change. Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=937.32s)]
*  That he was gonna keep the status quo. So that's why they didn't mind him and they gave him a lot [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=939.08s)]
*  of positive coverage. And now when I see them giving positive coverage to AOC, I'm like, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=943.32s)]
*  it doesn't mean that she's doing anything wrong, but I am worried about it, right? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=948.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So jury's out, it's okay. Jury's out on everyone, right? Who knows who's gonna run in [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=952.6800000000001s)]
*  2028? But for me, I would say, just take the win, take the New York Senate seat, knock out Chuck [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=957.64s)]
*  Schumer. That's an indisputably good win for everyone on the left. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=964.92s)]
*  Agreed, agreed, absolutely. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sxIbHfdjVU&t=968.92s)]
