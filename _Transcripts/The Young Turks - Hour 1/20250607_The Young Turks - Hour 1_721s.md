"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is getting blunt about why Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election.
While speaking to BBC Radio 4 during the London leg of his ‚ÄúFighting Oligarchy‚Äù tour, the two-time presidential candidate said it was wrong to pin Harris‚Äô defeat on then-President Joe Biden‚Äôs late retreat from the race."

# Bernie Gives UNEXPECTED Defense Of Joe Biden
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk)
*  Joe Biden, it turns out, and I want you to hear this cuz you're not hearing this side [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=0.0s)]
*  of the story. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=4.22s)]
*  A lot of the people are saying, it was Joe Biden's fault that Kamala Harris lost the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=5.22s)]
*  election. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=10.46s)]
*  Just Joe Biden, he should have gotten out earlier. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=11.46s)]
*  Not true. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=13.98s)]
*  Not true. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=16.26s)]
*  That was Senator Bernie Sanders who thinks that former President Joe Biden's decision [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=17.26s)]
*  to run for reelection, even though he shouldn't have, and stay in the race until it was far [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  too late for Kamala Harris to really run a robust campaign, shouldn't be considered at [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=29.94s)]
*  fault for Harris' loss. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=35.08s)]
*  Now, look, I disagree a little bit with Sanders here because I do think that Biden was a factor [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=37.300000000000004s)]
*  in Kamala Harris' loss. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=44.36s)]
*  We're gonna get to what he thinks is the real cause in just a minute, but what are your [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=46.58s)]
*  thoughts? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=50.84s)]
*  No, I totally disagree. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=51.84s)]
*  Joe Biden screwed us, screwed us hard. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=52.84s)]
*  He should have been a transition president, as he said from day one. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=55.78s)]
*  He certainly should have made that decision in 2022. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=59.78s)]
*  By 2023, it was imperative. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=63.7s)]
*  We had a petition, and we ran as a protest candidate. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=67.12s)]
*  Anyone with eyes could tell he was too old. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=70.34s)]
*  We ran a clip earlier in the show from Joe Biden in 2019, and he looked infinitely better, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=72.28s)]
*  and not great, but infinitely better than he did by 2023. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=77.38s)]
*  It was super obvious to everyone. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=81.3s)]
*  This is the one thing that Bernie is massively biased about. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=83.22s)]
*  He thinks that Joe Biden is his friend. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=87.12s)]
*  I don't even believe that that's true at all. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=89.02s)]
*  And I don't know if that breaks his heart, but I think that Biden's never really believed [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=91.46s)]
*  that Bernie was his friend. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=95.58s)]
*  He screwed him over on every bill, and Bernie still doesn't realize that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=97.06s)]
*  And so he keeps defending Biden. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=101.14s)]
*  And let's be honest, fair is shown in America. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=103.14s)]
*  I love Bernie, but both Bernie and AOC were the biggest advocates of keeping Biden in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=105.3s)]
*  the race. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=111.06s)]
*  It's true, it's true. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=112.06s)]
*  And they were totally and utterly wrong. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=113.06s)]
*  It's actually addressed in Jake Tapper's and Alex Thompson's book Original Sin. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=115.22s)]
*  And it was because progressives felt that they had at least some influence over the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=121.66s)]
*  Biden administration. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=127.22s)]
*  Which just wasn't true. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=128.22s)]
*  It was a mirage. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=129.86s)]
*  I mean, look, if you want to compare Biden to, if you want to compare Biden to Obama, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=130.98s)]
*  okay, maybe you can make an argument, but that wasn't enough influence. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=139.26s)]
*  That's a super low bar. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=142.66s)]
*  It is, it is a super low bar. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=144.32s)]
*  Okay, you had a tiny more influence than when Rahm Emanuel was running the White House's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=145.6s)]
*  chief of staff. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=149.56s)]
*  Okay, that's not that impressive. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=150.56s)]
*  The one thing that they got in there was Green New Deal stuff, but you guys didn't know that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=152.78s)]
*  Trump was gonna take that out of the first possible opportunity. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  They're taking it out in the budget bill. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=159.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=160.68s)]
*  So all that is gone now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=161.68s)]
*  The progressive victories at this point are near zero with Biden. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=162.68s)]
*  So look, before we get to what Senator Sanders believes is the reason for Kamala Harris's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=166.42s)]
*  loss, I do want to just hear him kind of like weigh in on, it's amazing because he was kind [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=174.04s)]
*  of quiet about this until now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=181.92s)]
*  It's probably because it's his last term in the Senate. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=183.55999999999997s)]
*  He's not gonna run for reelection. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=187.44s)]
*  So he's just kind of letting the Democrats have it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  He brought this up, take a look. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=190.6s)]
*  What I am telling you is not what the party wants. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=193.88s)]
*  So if there was somebody from quote unquote the party, the establishment of the white [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=197.92s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, terrible, worst guy in the world. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=201.76s)]
*  Yeah, don't think that there- [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=203.8s)]
*  And it's worth reminding people, they kept you out in 2016. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=205.32s)]
*  In 2016, if you'd run, you probably would have won. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=208.16s)]
*  You're smart. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=210.68s)]
*  There's a good chance that would have happened. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=211.68s)]
*  And in 2020, we won the first three primaries and suddenly everybody left the campaign and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=212.92s)]
*  they rallied around Joe Biden. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=218.28s)]
*  That's true. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=221.92s)]
*  And that kind of goes to your point, Cenk. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=222.92s)]
*  I mean, during the 2020 primaries, Bernie Sanders was on a roll. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=223.92s)]
*  He won Nevada big. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=229.44s)]
*  He got people who had never voted before to the polls to support him in the primary. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=231.0s)]
*  And at that point, the corporate Democrats panicked. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=237.92s)]
*  Some sort of deal was made and every Democratic candidate dropped out and backed Biden, which [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=241.52s)]
*  obviously destroyed Bernie Sanders' chances at winning the primary in 2020. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=247.8s)]
*  So Bernie's policies are the core of the Democratic Party, paid family leave, higher minimum wage, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=252.36s)]
*  lower drug prices, etc., right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=258.6s)]
*  So almost all Democrats agree to those core economic policies. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=260.46s)]
*  But the corporate Democrats, which is a great majority of the party, established from Democrats [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=264.7s)]
*  like Biden and Hillary Clinton, hate those policies. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=268.29999999999995s)]
*  They don't want to pass those policies. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=271.82s)]
*  They claim they're incompetent because of the parliamentarian twist of their arm. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=274.62s)]
*  They just couldn't find a way to pass bills that were over 80%, 90% in popularity. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=278.97999999999996s)]
*  Liars. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=284.9s)]
*  They work for their donors. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=285.9s)]
*  Their donors told them, shut up and do not do any of those bills. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=287.18s)]
*  Don't even propose those bills. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=292.22s)]
*  And that same donor class despises Bernie because they got a sense that Bernie would [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  actually do those bills. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=299.26000000000005s)]
*  And they don't want those bills. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  They want the voters to believe they're gonna do those bills and then do a switcheroo and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=303.3s)]
*  go, ha ha, just kidding. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=307.6s)]
*  You got another corporate Democrat, they're not gonna do anything for you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=308.6s)]
*  And now the Democratic leadership's polling at 19%. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=312.0s)]
*  What did we tell you? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=315.22s)]
*  We were right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=316.44s)]
*  They were wrong. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=317.90000000000003s)]
*  They told you they were geniuses who knew how to manipulate people and get, boy, we're [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=319.48s)]
*  really gonna do these bills, wig. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=324.54s)]
*  We told you they were never gonna do those bills and that they were giant liars. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  And then at the end they would get caught. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=332.64s)]
*  They got caught cuz they were lying all along. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=333.76s)]
*  Now let's get to who Bernie blames for Kamala Harris' loss in the presidential election. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=337.18s)]
*  A lot of the people are saying it was Joe Biden's fault that Kamala Harris lost the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  election, just Joe Biden. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=349.32s)]
*  He should have gotten out earlier. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=351.08s)]
*  Not true. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  It was the fault of Kamala Harris and her consultants. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  Apropos of everything that I've been talking about this morning, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  they did not run a campaign designed to speak to the American working class. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=363.53999999999996s)]
*  I ran all over the country trying to elect Kamala Harris and begged them, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=367.82s)]
*  talk to the needs of the working class. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=372.17999999999995s)]
*  Talk about raising the minimum wage to a living wage. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=374.1s)]
*  Talk about real healthcare reform. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=376.86s)]
*  Talk about building the kinds of massive amounts of housing that we need, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=378.82000000000005s)]
*  putting checks on landlords' greets on housing. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=382.5s)]
*  But they used their billionaire friends to get out and basically say, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=385.5s)]
*  you know Liz Cheney, who is, I appreciate her courage. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=392.66s)]
*  But she's a very conservative Republican. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=399.02000000000004s)]
*  And Kamala spent more time with Liz Cheney almost than with anybody else. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=401.46s)]
*  What is that message out to working class people? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=406.46s)]
*  So while I disagree with Senator Sanders in regard to Biden's impact on the outcome [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=410.7s)]
*  of the 2024 presidential election, I wholeheartedly agree with him when it [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=415.94s)]
*  comes to his critiques toward Kamala Harris. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=421.02s)]
*  And guess what, I'm not the only one who agrees with him because get a load of how [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=424.97999999999996s)]
*  voters feel about the Democratic Party's vision for our economic future. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=429.74s)]
*  You would think after all of the waves, Kate Baldwin, after the last few months, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=437.90000000000003s)]
*  the first five months of the Donald Trump presidency, right? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=441.94s)]
*  The first four months of the Donald Trump presidency, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=444.62s)]
*  that you expect that Democrats are at this massive lead on the economy. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=446.78000000000003s)]
*  It ain't so, it ain't so. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=450.54s)]
*  The party that is closest to your economic views, in November of 2023, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=452.06s)]
*  it was the Republicans by 11 points. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=455.54s)]
*  Now it's still within that range, still within that margin of error, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=457.38s)]
*  plus eight point advantage for the Republican Party. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=460.58s)]
*  How is that possible, Democrats? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=463.5s)]
*  How is that possible after all the recession, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=465.14s)]
*  after the stock market's been doing all of this, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=467.65999999999997s)]
*  after all the tariffs that Americans are against, and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=469.9s)]
*  Republicans still hold an eight point lead on the economy? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=472.17999999999995s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=475.05999999999995s)]
*  No, no, the voters are not kidding. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=477.9s)]
*  What is the vision for the economy from the Democratic Party? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=480.5s)]
*  I don't know what they stand for. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=486.14s)]
*  No one knows what the Democratic Party stands for. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=487.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so we just did a segment about how Donald Trump is losing Latino voters, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=490.34s)]
*  independent voters, because of the economy's not doing well, right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=494.62s)]
*  Both sides think that they could trick people and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=498.94s)]
*  come to find out that they can't, right? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=501.14s)]
*  So first, on Bernie Sanders' point about how Kamala Harris lost the election, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=503.3s)]
*  he's absolutely right, back on track, okay? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=509.34s)]
*  In fact, I'll read a member from Twitch here, barely funky, wrote in, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=512.18s)]
*  yeah, but Harris had a lead after the debate, and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=515.9399999999999s)]
*  then she started listening to her election advisors. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=518.26s)]
*  That's exactly right, exactly right. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=520.62s)]
*  I love having the smartest audience in the world, okay? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=522.22s)]
*  So, and we tracked it for you guys as we were going through the campaign. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=524.6999999999999s)]
*  She starts at a huge deficit because Biden handed her a dumpster fire. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=528.62s)]
*  And then she does this populist proposals of going after price gouging, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=532.74s)]
*  lowering housing prices. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=538.3s)]
*  We're like, great, that's great, picks Tim Walz, we're like, amazing, amazing. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=539.5799999999999s)]
*  And she's rising, rising, rising. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=542.74s)]
*  Then as Bernie points out in the longer version there, she brings in Mark Cuban, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=544.62s)]
*  as you saw there, Liz Cheney, and brings in the one percenters and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=548.98s)]
*  starts listening to her corrupt, dumbass consultants. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=553.0200000000001s)]
*  And they tell her, yeah, people love billionaires, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=557.22s)]
*  why don't you have more billionaires and celebrities around you, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=559.4200000000001s)]
*  Hey, punch it, idiots, losers. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=562.86s)]
*  And Kamala Harris, since she has no mind of her own, yeah, I said it, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=565.38s)]
*  go cry about it, all the Democratic ass kissers, okay? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=569.26s)]
*  She's like, my consultants tell me that the American people love the top 1%, and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=573.14s)]
*  they love warmongers like Liz and Dick Cheney. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=578.06s)]
*  Well, I'll wrap myself around them because, sorry, but [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=580.46s)]
*  you're not very good at this, okay? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=583.5s)]
*  And your word silence isn't going to help you. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=586.18s)]
*  But by the way, Bernie, again, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=587.78s)]
*  was Biden running a campaign on helping the working man? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=589.38s)]
*  Biden wasn't even running a campaign. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=593.1s)]
*  He didn't do a Super Bowl interview, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=595.8199999999999s)]
*  anytime you asked him, he's like, we defeated Medicare. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=597.14s)]
*  He didn't, he ran no campaign. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=601.6600000000001s)]
*  And anytime they asked him, and this is in the books now, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=604.6600000000001s)]
*  this is documented by Biden insiders. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=607.94s)]
*  When they said, look, we gotta have a good reason for [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=610.46s)]
*  why you should be president again, right? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=612.6600000000001s)]
*  Why should you get reelected? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=614.74s)]
*  And every time Biden, NATO loves me, the leaders of Europe, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=615.86s)]
*  they are in our allies, they think I'm a great president. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=619.82s)]
*  And they're like, sir, you're running in America, not in Europe, and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=623.98s)]
*  you're going to want me to talk about the average man? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=627.22s)]
*  No, no, no, all of the elites love me. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=630.1s)]
*  My God, what a bunch of losers. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=632.62s)]
*  So as Trump is having trouble because the economy has not at all [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=634.86s)]
*  improved, in fact, it's gone down, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=638.0200000000001s)]
*  the Democrats aren't gaining anything. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=641.0200000000001s)]
*  Why aren't they gaining anything? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=642.9000000000001s)]
*  Because they still have Hakeem Jeffries and [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=644.7800000000001s)]
*  Chuck Schumer going out there and proposing nothing, nothing. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=646.6600000000001s)]
*  Why don't you propose something? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=651.5400000000001s)]
*  No, they're proposing some stuff. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=652.94s)]
*  I mean, Schumer is proposing that the Trump administration avoid [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=654.5s)]
*  a diplomatic negotiation with Iran to prevent them from building nuclear [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=658.66s)]
*  weapons and would prefer that we go to war with Iran. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=663.3s)]
*  So he's proposing some stuff. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=666.74s)]
*  Yeah. That would hurt our economy, but hey. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=668.02s)]
*  Literally no talk of helping the average working man, none, zero. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=670.58s)]
*  Corporate Democrats are never going to learn a lesson because they're corrupt. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=675.62s)]
*  They don't work for the average person, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=681.1s)]
*  they work for the people who pay them. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=683.38s)]
*  That's how corruption works. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=685.86s)]
*  Same is true of the Republicans. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=688.0999999999999s)]
*  Democrats just pretend more that they're going to represent [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=690.02s)]
*  the working class and then they smear it all over their face. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=693.14s)]
*  Now, by the way, same thing's happening to Trump, because he's pretending that he's [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=696.5799999999999s)]
*  helping the working class and then isn't. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=699.9399999999999s)]
*  Right. Isn't doing anything to help the working man. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=702.5s)]
*  Instead he's like, the most important bill is the one that gives tax cuts to the rich. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=704.78s)]
*  Please give everything to the rich. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=709.42s)]
*  Okay, go make the same mistake Biden did. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=711.06s)]
*  See how it turns out for you. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=713.4599999999999s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=714.9s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-yVGEYJRlk&t=717.98s)]
