"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) voted for the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äù that‚Äôs backed by President Donald Trump, but admitted on Tuesday that she had not read it.
The budget bill recently passed by the GOP-majority House was put forward under the reconciliation process to avoid getting blockaded by a filibuster in the Senate. It is nonetheless struggling to get the support of enough senators to pass, despite Trump‚Äôs loud urging. Republicans have a narrow majority in the Senate and with Democrats expected to vote against the bill, it would only take a few GOP holdouts to block it from passing and kick it back to the House for revisions."

# Marjorie Greene Is On Team Musk!!
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E)
*  So what do you make of what Elon Musk said today? Because he said, I'm sorry, but I just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=0.0s)]
*  can't stand it anymore. This massive outrageous pork filled congressional spending bill is [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=5.76s)]
*  a disgusting abomination. What would you say to Elon Musk? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=10.44s)]
*  Well, I very much support Elon and I have supported Doge. I fully understand what Elon [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=14.8s)]
*  is saying and I agree with him to a certain extent. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=22.56s)]
*  All of a sudden Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has a big issue with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=28.48s)]
*  the big beautiful bill as Trump likes to call it. The bill that Marjorie Taylor Greene as [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=33.56s)]
*  a member of the House of Representatives voted in favor of. But apparently there was a provision [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=38.76s)]
*  that she didn't read, didn't know was included. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=43.0s)]
*  And now she's worried about it and is partly siding with Elon Musk. So during an interview [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=46.64s)]
*  with News Nation last night, she said that she sympathized with Elon Musk's concerns [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=52.06s)]
*  about the spending bill after he called it a disgusting abomination. Okay, so she said [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=57.96s)]
*  that she was also careful to basically make her undying support for Donald Trump clear [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=65.12s)]
*  because of course you just have to do that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=72.64s)]
*  I love you, Daddy Trump. I'm not mad at you. And that she overall still supported the spirit [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=74.98s)]
*  of the bill, but that one provision, that one provision. Now let's hear what she has [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=82.38s)]
*  to say next. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=86.6s)]
*  Here's what I supported in the bill. I supported making the president's tax cuts and jobs plan [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  permanent. I also support the money that it spends for the border, border security and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=94.82s)]
*  also for energy. And I think those things are important. Do I like the spending? No, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=100.96s)]
*  absolutely I don't. We can't get out of $36 trillion in debt without something else. That's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=106.22s)]
*  called economic growth. We can't just cut our way out of this because the interest is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=111.38000000000001s)]
*  accumulating too fast and there's just no way to cut enough spending to dig our way [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=122.86s)]
*  We have to grow the economy. And President Trump is doing a great job with that, bringing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=123.86s)]
*  in so many businesses that are investing in America. The GDP is doing great. Inflation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  is coming down. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=133.04s)]
*  Inflation is dropping. GDP was down 0.2. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=134.58s)]
*  Okay, look, I'm tired of having the same ridiculous conversation. Yeah, yeah, we do have a terrible [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=138.58s)]
*  federal debt. We're not gonna be able to do anything about it unless we raise taxes. And [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=145.46s)]
*  honestly, the taxes should not be raised on working class Americans. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=152.02s)]
*  It should be raised on the very well off, very wealthy people in this country that have [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=155.34s)]
*  been hoarding their wealth and getting away with paying far less percentage wise of their [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=162.02s)]
*  income toward federal taxes compared to everyone else. But that's not gonna happen when she [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=166.02s)]
*  says we need to cut spending. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=171.06s)]
*  We know what the spending that they're focusing on is and it's the social safety net. Okay, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=172.62s)]
*  so essentially screw over the poor, screw over people who need that assistance in order [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=178.4s)]
*  to give more tax benefits and tax cuts to the rich. I'm not interested in hearing about [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=187.78s)]
*  I'm going to go back to the one area where she does have a good point. And that has to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=188.78s)]
*  do with the fact that there's a provision having to do with AI that she didn't read [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=191.98s)]
*  ahead of time, didn't know about, but still voted for the bill. She says full transparency, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=196.82s)]
*  I did not know about this section on pages 278 to 279 of the bill that strips states [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=201.3s)]
*  of their right to make laws or regulate artificial intelligence for 10 years. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=209.06s)]
*  I'm adamantly opposed to this and it is a violation of states rights and I would have [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=215.82000000000002s)]
*  voted no if I had known that this was in there. I don't know, look, we can never know if she [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  would actually vote no had she known that that provision was in there. I'm pretty sure [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  with enough pressure from Trump she would have voted yes anyway. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=230.96s)]
*  But under the provision that she's referring to, new state level AI regulations would be [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  banned for 10 years. And the enforcement of dozens of pre-existing state regulations would [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=240.58s)]
*  be prohibited as well. These existing rules take aim at widespread concerns like deep [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=247.34s)]
*  fake misinformation, algorithmic rent setting tools, and AI generated explicit content, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=253.34s)]
*  particularly of children. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=260.78s)]
*  So basically, if a state decides, all right, the federal government, Congress, totally [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=263.7s)]
*  useless. So in our state, we're gonna make decisions about regulating artificial intelligence. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=268.3s)]
*  They're just not gonna be able to do that if this bill passes the Senate with that provision [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=273.66s)]
*  included in it. Cenk. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, this is gonna help my reputation a lot. So I'm gonna agree with [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  her on two things. First, let me get out of the way the obvious things. Was her not reading [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=289.3s)]
*  the bill ahead of voting for it bad? Yeah, of course, of course, it was obviously bad. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=296.26000000000005s)]
*  It was obviously ha ha. It was obviously LOL, right? Now, having said that, it is a one [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=302.74s)]
*  thing to give her credit on is, it's an ironic kind of honesty. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=309.8s)]
*  With these professional actor politicians, you would never get that kind of honesty, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=314.1s)]
*  cuz it involves being slightly human, including making a mistake and an error and owning up [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=319.38000000000005s)]
*  to it. And even if she owned up to it in a way that was not perfectly conscious, like [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=324.38s)]
*  maybe she said, I didn't read it, so I didn't know, oops, I shouldn't have said it. However [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=329.46s)]
*  you interpret that, or it was courageous cuz she knows she's gonna get lambasted for it, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  but she does it anyway. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=340.02s)]
*  I don't care which of those interpretations you have, right? So the bottom line is, at [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=341.02s)]
*  least she's saying, yeah, my bad, which a politician almost never says, right? And then [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  number two, she's using it as a moment to focus on a part of the bill that should be [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=348.98s)]
*  taken out. And guys, if you're a right winger and you like Marjorie Taylor Greene, right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=354.0s)]
*  Remember she's trying to remove a provision that doesn't let you regulate. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  Like you were told all your life, regulation is bad, all regulations are bad, right? But [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=365.98s)]
*  she's trying to allow for regulations at the state level, why? Cuz if you have an AI program [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=370.74s)]
*  that is totally out of control, you're gonna need to regulate it. The answer isn't overregulation, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=376.38s)]
*  the answer isn't under regulation. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=382.42s)]
*  The question is, what do we regulate, who regulates it, and why, right? So in this case, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=384.38s)]
*  she happens to be right about the substance, should she have read the bill earlier? Of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=390.5s)]
*  course, one last quick little thing. She is also right that they do this trick all the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=394.46000000000004s)]
*  time, both Republican and Democratic leadership. We're gonna vote on a bill, it's like 4,000 [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=399.98s)]
*  pages, you have 25 seconds to read it, go. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=404.78s)]
*  And if you vote the wrong way, we'll mark it against you for the rest of your life and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=408.35999999999996s)]
*  my primary, go. And then by the way, the stuff that they sneak into that bill, and by the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=411.38s)]
*  way, we'll be giving Israel another $8 billion for batteries for Iron Dome. Anyway, vote [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=416.38s)]
*  now, go, go, go, right? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=421.7s)]
*  So you get a kind of couple of public service announcements out of this, even though, yes, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=423.82s)]
*  obviously, she should have read the bill first. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40b5d3MTl3E&t=433.48s)]
