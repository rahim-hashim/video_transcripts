The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Pentagon Dysfunction Is Getting OUT OF CONTROL
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik)
*  A few leakers get fired and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=0.0s)]
*  suddenly a bunch of hit pieces [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1.46s)]
*  come out. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=3.1s)]
*  Ask the hoodies, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=3.68s)]
*  how much this function there? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=4.7s)]
*  Pete's doing a great job. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=6.42s)]
*  Everybody's happy with him. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=9.28s)]
*  We have the highest recruitment [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=10.92s)]
*  numbers I think they've had in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=12.8s)]
*  28 years. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=14.48s)]
*  No, he's doing a great job. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=15.08s)]
*  It's just fake news. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=17.96s)]
*  They just bring up stories. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=18.96s)]
*  I guess it sounds like this grunt [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=20.12s)]
*  old employees, he was put there to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=21.92s)]
*  get rid of a lot of bad people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=23.84s)]
*  But is Defense Secretary Pete [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=26.6s)]
*  Hegseth getting rid of a lot of bad [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=28.76s)]
*  people or is he just getting rid of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=30.96s)]
*  Defense Department officials who [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  don't agree with attacking Iran on [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=35.260000000000005s)]
*  behalf of Israel? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=37.32s)]
*  That's the real question here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=38.28s)]
*  And we're going to get to those [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=39.4s)]
*  details in just a minute. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=40.64s)]
*  Regardless, President Trump has [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=41.68s)]
*  decided to publicly defend [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=43.72s)]
*  Secretary of State Pete Hegseth, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=45.46s)]
*  even as absolute chaos is playing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=47.6s)]
*  out within the Pentagon. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=49.72s)]
*  But NPR Cenk is reporting that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=51.2s)]
*  there are some rumors within [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=53.76s)]
*  the White House that they're [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=55.6s)]
*  looking for replacement for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=59.32s)]
*  And we're going to get to the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=60.28s)]
*  details on that in just a minute. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=61.04s)]
*  But what do you think about those [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=62.2s)]
*  rumors? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=63.2s)]
*  So the rumors are almost certainly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=63.8s)]
*  right because now a lot of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=65.84s)]
*  right wingers are confirming them [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=67.36s)]
*  and we'll get to that in a little [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=69.32s)]
*  bit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=70.92s)]
*  But to me, the most interesting [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=71.48s)]
*  thing is what you just said, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=73.12s)]
*  Casper, why? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=74.48s)]
*  because there are two [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=75.2s)]
*  possibilities. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=76.28s)]
*  One, Hegseth is just a disaster. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=77.08s)]
*  And we've got all sorts of issues, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=79.6s)]
*  personal issues with Hegseth that's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  leading to the disaster. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=84.2s)]
*  Or there's this giant fight in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=85.92s)]
*  the pro-Israel and anti-Israel [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  camps. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=90.56s)]
*  There is no anti-Israel camp, but [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=91.48s)]
*  hey, let's not do everything [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Israel-ass camp, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  Within the administration, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  within the Defense Department, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=97.4s)]
*  is that what the real issue is? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's try to find out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=101.76s)]
*  So I did some deep research into [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  this story because I was really [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=104.56s)]
*  curious about that very question [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=105.84s)]
*  and I've got some receipts. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=107.4s)]
*  So let's get to it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  Now, part of what has really blown [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=111.0s)]
*  up in regard to criticism toward [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=113.52s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=115.76s)]
*  the fact that a Trump loyalist and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=118.28s)]
*  a former Pentagon official, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=120.8s)]
*  spokesperson for the Pentagon, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=122.88s)]
*  who advocated for Pete Hegseth to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=125.24s)]
*  be confirmed as Defense Secretary [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=127.44s)]
*  has now essentially put out this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  long piece in Politico to talk [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=132.36s)]
*  about the chaos that has been [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=134.48s)]
*  unfolding within the Defense [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=136.48s)]
*  Department. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=138.56s)]
*  So this is John Uliot, who is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=139.76s)]
*  the former chief Pentagon [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=141.76s)]
*  spokesperson. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=143.48s)]
*  He was in fact offered a new role [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  within the Pentagon. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=147.12s)]
*  He claimed that it was a generous [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  offer by Hegseth himself, but [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=150.67999999999998s)]
*  he decided that he would not take [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  that role. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=154.2s)]
*  Nonetheless, he writes that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  President Donald Trump has a strong [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=156.88s)]
*  record of holding his top [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=158.72s)]
*  officials to account. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=160.0s)]
*  Given that, it's hard to see [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=161.56s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=163.04s)]
*  remaining in his role for [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=164.68s)]
*  much longer. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=165.92s)]
*  So the fact that he wrote this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  opinion piece again is very [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=168.6s)]
*  relevant considering the fact that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=170.04s)]
*  he is not some Trump administration [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=171.96s)]
*  hater. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=173.88s)]
*  He's very much supportive of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=174.4s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=175.6s)]
*  He was supportive of Hegseth, but [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=176.48s)]
*  notice that there was a lack of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=178.6s)]
*  real leadership in the Pentagon as [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=180.56s)]
*  a result of Hegseth serving as [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=182.72s)]
*  Secretary of Defense. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=184.6s)]
*  Go ahead, Cenk. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=186.24s)]
*  Yeah, one quick thing about this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=187.4s)]
*  guy, so you know he's legit only [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=189.04s)]
*  in this regard, not for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=190.8s)]
*  anything else, is that he's the guy [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=192.2s)]
*  who was trying to root out DEI from [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=194.32s)]
*  the Pentagon. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=196.36s)]
*  He's the guy that was wanting to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=197.2s)]
*  take reference to Jackie Robinson [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=199.64s)]
*  off of Defense Department [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  materials, etc. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=204.04s)]
*  So my point there isn't that he's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=205.56s)]
*  a good guy, my point is that he's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=207.32s)]
*  die hard conservative. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=210.64s)]
*  So this is not some sort of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=211.16s)]

*  Yulia writes that in the aftermath [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  Defense Department officials [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=278.04s)]

*  this month, yet none of this is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=289.96s)]
*  true, he writes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=292.16s)]
*  So what does he mean by that? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=294.52s)]
*  Well, apparently the Defense [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=296.0s)]
*  Department had said that it would [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=298.08s)]
*  conduct polygraph tests to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=300.36s)]
*  determine who within the department [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=302.22s)]
*  was lying about leaking information [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=304.64s)]
*  to reporters. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=307.28s)]
*  Now at least one of the individuals [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=309.12s)]
*  who got fired has said that, look, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=311.48s)]
*  none of us have had any polygraph [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=314.12s)]
*  tests. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=316.4s)]
*  And the other thing that they've [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=317.64s)]
*  said is that one of them was told [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=319.68s)]
*  by former colleagues at the Defense [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=321.68s)]
*  Department that they were cleared [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=323.76s)]
*  of any wrongdoing and they don't [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=325.76s)]
*  have to worry about getting fired [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=327.64s)]
*  and then they ended up getting [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  fired. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=331.08s)]
*  So the cover story is that they got [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  fired for leaking when that's not [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  really the case. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=335.24s)]
*  So why did they get fired? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=336.28s)]
*  So then on Friday, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=337.84s)]
*  Politico reported that Hegseth's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  Chief of Staff Joe Casper was also [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=340.56s)]
*  stepping down from his role, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=342.28s)]
*  which is odd considering Casper is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=343.88s)]
*  the one who called for [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=345.8s)]
*  the investigations into [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=346.92s)]
*  the department to determine who [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=348.32s)]
*  within the department is leaking [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  information to reporters. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=352.0s)]
*  And he was also the one who was [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=353.88s)]
*  advocating for a pause on [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=355.96s)]
*  intelligence gathering on behalf [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=357.78s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=360.12s)]
*  So Joe Casper apparently didn't [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=361.44s)]
*  like those guys, said one defense [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=363.64s)]
*  official, they all have different [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=365.88s)]
*  styles, they just didn't get along, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=368.2s)]
*  it was a personality clash. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  So right now as we speak, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=372.76s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  the head of the Defense Department [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=374.88s)]
*  is presiding over a department [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=376.88s)]
*  where his two closest advisors for [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=378.56s)]
*  over a decade are no longer there. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=380.56s)]
*  And he's without chiefs of staff [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=382.96s)]
*  for himself and for his deputy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=385.08s)]
*  So why did they get fired, Cenk? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=387.2s)]
*  And it turns out there's infighting [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=389.88s)]
*  over the topic of going to war with [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=394.44s)]
*  You have the so [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  called interventionists, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=397.52s)]
*  the neoconservatives who very much [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=399.2s)]
*  want to carry out what's in the best [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=401.12s)]
*  interest of Israel as opposed to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=403.0s)]
*  the United States. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=404.8s)]
*  And then you have the America First [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=406.08s)]
*  crowd who appears to be pushed out [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=408.08s)]
*  of the Defense Department. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  I'll give you some specific [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=411.4s)]
*  examples as to why, go ahead. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=412.68s)]
*  Yeah, so here's what we know and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=414.36s)]
*  what we don't know. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  So we know for sure that there's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=416.96s)]
*  a giant blow up at the Pentagon, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  So those is super weird for [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=421.08s)]
*  him to fire diehard conservatives [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=422.88s)]
*  and his allies for [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=425.36s)]
*  the last decade, right? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=426.79999999999995s)]
*  So that doesn't make any sense. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  It doesn't make sense at all. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=431.0s)]
*  So there's a mystery there for [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=432.12s)]
*  sure. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=433.52s)]
*  Okay, then number two is we know [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=434.24s)]
*  that the official cover story is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=435.88s)]
*  not anywhere near true. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=437.48s)]
*  And the guys that they were fired [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=439.04s)]
*  and then had the leaks against them [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=440.44s)]
*  and said, they're like, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=441.88s)]
*  not only all the things that Ana [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=442.96s)]
*  said, they're like, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=444.44s)]
*  we were looking forward to the lie [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=445.56s)]
*  detector test and then they never [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=447.04s)]
*  gave us one and then pretended that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=448.64s)]
*  it was better. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=450.28s)]
*  So the official story is definitely [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=451.12s)]
*  garbage, right? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=452.76s)]
*  So that leads us to trying to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=453.96s)]
*  figure out, so [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=455.52s)]
*  why are they actually doing this? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=456.52s)]
*  That's the big mystery. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=458.92s)]
*  So now, and by the way, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  as you heard me talk about it on [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  the show earlier when Laura Loomer [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=463.6s)]
*  went in and said, I found a list of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=465.76000000000005s)]
*  the neocons and we're going to [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  oust them. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  I thought that is super strange. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  She's massively pro-Israel. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=475.12s)]
*  And she's against the neocons. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  That story doesn't make any sense. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=479.6s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=481.12s)]
*  And now I totally believe that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=481.76s)]
*  that was a total lie. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=483.76s)]
*  That she had done an investigation [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=486.0s)]
*  and she wanted to root out anyone. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=488.0s)]
*  Within the executive branch that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=490.4s)]
*  wasn't serving the America First [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=492.44s)]
*  Agenda, because the America First [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=494.56s)]
*  Agenda runs up against, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=496.92s)]
*  it is counter to US foreign policy [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=498.72s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=500.96s)]
*  And Laura Loomer loves US foreign [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=502.88s)]
*  policy in regard to Israel. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=504.52s)]
*  So I just find it hard to believe [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=505.88s)]
*  that she worked to oust individuals [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=507.92s)]
*  who are neocons when her foreign [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=510.48s)]
*  policy preferences happen to align [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=512.88s)]
*  with neocons. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=515.44s)]
*  Yeah, so there's something fishy [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=517.04s)]
*  about that story. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=518.32s)]
*  So what did you find, Ana? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=519.4s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk about this a [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=520.84s)]
*  little bit. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=521.88s)]
*  So it's worth mentioning that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=522.4s)]
*  the America First crowd that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=523.92s)]
*  prioritizes the United States over [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=525.4s)]
*  Israel consists of the very people [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=527.24s)]
*  who are getting fired under these [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=529.16s)]
*  dubious claims of leaking, right? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=530.96s)]
*  So Caldwell, for instance, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=533.36s)]
*  supports a more realist and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=535.28s)]
*  restraint oriented national [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=537.36s)]
*  security policy, particularly in [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=539.8000000000001s)]
*  regard to Iran and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=542.76s)]
*  also in regard to Ukraine. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=544.24s)]
*  But for our purposes here, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=547.08s)]
*  we're going to focus on US foreign [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=548.56s)]
*  policy that suits the best interests [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=550.3599999999999s)]
*  of Israel as opposed to the United [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=552.4s)]
*  States. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=554.28s)]
*  And it's also been reported that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  there is an open clash among [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=556.92s)]
*  Trump's inner circle over whether [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=558.3599999999999s)]
*  or not the United States should go [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=560.16s)]
*  to war with Iran or attack Iran on [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=562.04s)]

*  about this. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  For instance, we know and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=592.12s)]
*  we've been knowing about how [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=593.48s)]
*  the Israel lobby has been trying to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=595.0400000000001s)]

*  Steve Witkoff, of course, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=600.1600000000001s)]
*  was the individual who pressured [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=601.5200000000001s)]

*  fell apart in the end. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=607.1600000000001s)]
*  But there was a temporary halt in [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=608.32s)]
*  the fighting, but [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  Israel didn't like that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=611.08s)]

*  ever since then they've been trying [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=614.36s)]

*  No, she's literally an Israeli. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=639.28s)]
*  I mean, she might be an Israeli [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=640.8s)]

*  So a quick clarification because it [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=659.6s)]

*  maybe we don't go to war with Iran [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=761.0s)]
*  on behalf of a foreign country. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  That's not going to be in the best [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=764.72s)]
*  interest of the American people or [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=766.32s)]
*  our military. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=767.96s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=768.76s)]
*  speaking of Mike Waltz, remember, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=769.76s)]
*  Mike Waltz was the guy who included [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=772.32s)]
*  Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=774.6400000000001s)]
*  in that Signal Chat that got Hegseth [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=777.32s)]
*  into a lot of hot water. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=779.72s)]
*  Interesting how he hasn't been [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=782.16s)]
*  fired, right? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=783.52s)]
*  But he is also the guy who has put [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=784.4399999999999s)]
*  that former Israeli Ministry of [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=786.64s)]
*  Defense employee in the NSC. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=788.76s)]
*  Yeah, so look, there's things we [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=790.88s)]
*  know and don't know, right? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=792.4799999999999s)]
*  So Mike Waltz is neocon totally in [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=793.76s)]
*  favor of Israel. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=796.28s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=798.8s)]
*  And in the beginning of [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  the administration, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=801.1199999999999s)]
*  we told you that Mary Madeleine, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  one of his top donors, basically [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=803.4799999999999s)]
*  asked for a number of neocons to go [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=805.0s)]
*  in the administration, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=806.5999999999999s)]
*  including Marco Rubio, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=807.7199999999999s)]
*  Secretary of State Mike Waltz, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=808.8s)]
*  the National Security Council, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=810.32s)]
*  Huckabee, and then Slotnik. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=812.1600000000001s)]
*  Slotnik, they ran into some [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=813.88s)]
*  problems because they didn't want [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=815.4000000000001s)]
*  to lose that house seat, right? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=817.44s)]
*  So and then Pete Hegseth we had as, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=819.5600000000001s)]
*  historically has been very pro [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  Israel, more militaristic, etc., but [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=824.08s)]
*  was not as clear as the others, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=826.7600000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=828.72s)]
*  So now to give you a sense again, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=829.32s)]
*  this is not about dual loyalties or [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=832.24s)]
*  Steve Woodcoff is also Jewish [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=833.0s)]
*  American, but Israel's apparently [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=834.44s)]
*  trying to oust him because he's not [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=836.48s)]
*  sufficiently loyal enough to [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  Israel, which bless his heart. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=840.24s)]
*  I mean, you're supposed to be [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=842.04s)]
*  representing us and he is. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=843.76s)]
*  So don't ever take it out on our [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=845.48s)]
*  Jewish American brothers and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=846.84s)]
*  sisters, right? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=848.12s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't even say that he's [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=848.84s)]
*  not sufficiently loyal to Israel. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=850.5600000000001s)]
*  He just wanted to broker a ceasefire [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=852.04s)]
*  deal and Israel didn't like that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=854.28s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=857.0s)]
*  you're absolutely right. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=857.96s)]
*  I can make an argument for [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=859.12s)]
*  that is much better for Israel. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  100%, yeah. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=862.76s)]
*  But he's not sufficiently loyal to [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=863.52s)]
*  the lunatics currently running [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=865.28s)]
*  the Israeli government. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=866.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=868.2s)]
*  Right, and so I'm going to add one [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=868.88s)]
*  more piece of data to this, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=871.0400000000001s)]
*  which is that the other day Mark [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=872.84s)]
*  Levin got appointed to a government [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=874.96s)]
*  post and I was like, Mark Levin. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=877.6s)]
*  Mark Levin is the most Israel first [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=880.2s)]
*  guy in all of American media. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=882.88s)]
*  He makes Ben Shapiro look like he's [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=885.08s)]
*  part of the Gaza resistance. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=887.52s)]
*  And so and he was furious that we [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=889.88s)]
*  didn't attack Iran, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=891.8000000000001s)]
*  furious whenever we don't do [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=893.0s)]
*  anything that Israel commands. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=894.84s)]
*  And he got appointed to a Homeland [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=897.16s)]
*  Security Advisory Council. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=899.8s)]
*  So there's movement here guys. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=902.64s)]
*  So there and remember just last [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=904.68s)]
*  week reporters have really piece of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=906.76s)]
*  good news which huge piece of good [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=909.0799999999999s)]
*  news, which is that Trump refused [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=911.3199999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu's request to bomb Iran. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=913.6s)]
*  For now. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=916.28s)]
*  Right for now. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=916.78s)]
*  And so and now that things are not [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=917.92s)]
*  going in the direction that Netanyahu [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=920.12s)]
*  wants, all of a sudden chairs are [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=922.72s)]
*  getting moved around in the Trump [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=924.9599999999999s)]
*  administration. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=927.12s)]
*  And people that are more likely to [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=928.44s)]
*  say, yeah, we should definitely [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=930.16s)]
*  attack Iran are being brought into [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=931.92s)]
*  the room. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=933.64s)]
*  And the people who are saying, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=934.16s)]
*  hey, maybe we should serve America [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=935.52s)]
*  first are being moved out of the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=937.16s)]
*  room. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=938.6s)]
*  So I want to just go back to this [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=939.12s)]
*  piece that was written by Uliot [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=941.04s)]
*  because he also mentions all of [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=943.16s)]
*  the other foibles that have gone on [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=945.28s)]
*  in the Defense Department under [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=947.64s)]
*  Hegseth leadership. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=949.8s)]
*  Obviously, their signal gate where [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=951.32s)]
*  they're communicating, okay, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=953.88s)]
*  administration officials are [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=956.36s)]
*  communicating about an impending [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=958.36s)]
*  strike on the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=960.5600000000001s)]
*  But now it turns out according to [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=962.84s)]
*  a new New York Times piece, Hegseth [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=965.08s)]
*  also shared sensitive details about [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=967.64s)]
*  military operations in Yemen in [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=970.44s)]
*  another signal chat that included [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=972.8s)]
*  family members, namely his wife and [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=975.28s)]
*  I believe his brother as well. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=977.96s)]
*  So and his lawyer, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=980.32s)]
*  what are you doing? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=981.8s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=983.4s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=984.68s)]
*  So that news also led to this fury [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=985.8s)]
*  within the Trump administration [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=987.72s)]
*  about the leaks that have been [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=989.68s)]
*  going on because that report [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=991.36s)]
*  doesn't happen unless someone [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=992.92s)]
*  leaked it to the New York Times. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=994.56s)]
*  But nonetheless, the leaks I think [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=997.52s)]
*  are less of an issue. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=999.48s)]
*  What's a bigger issue here is that [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1000.76s)]
*  you have all this influence from [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1002.96s)]
*  a foreign government leading to [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1005.08s)]
*  personnel decisions within our very [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1007.3199999999999s)]
*  own Defense Department and [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1009.84s)]
*  that's unacceptable. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1011.84s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, I mean, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1013.6800000000001s)]
*  the reporting on this has been [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1015.72s)]
*  really miserable because they're [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  talking about there is a massive [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1020.0s)]
*  upheaval in the Defense Department. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1022.2s)]
*  Yeah, but why? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1025.64s)]
*  But literally no article talks [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1026.88s)]
*  about why, which by the way, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1028.6s)]
*  is it honestly another sign that [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1030.2s)]
*  it's Israel? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1031.92s)]
*  Because the one thing you're not [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1033.16s)]
*  allowed to talk about in mainstream [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1034.72s)]
*  media is Israel or money in [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1036.4s)]
*  politics, those are two issues [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1037.8s)]
*  you're never allowed to discuss, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1039.24s)]
*  right? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1040.8s)]
*  So you're telling me there's [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1041.32s)]
*  massive upheaval in the Defense [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1043.0s)]
*  Department and not a single [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1044.88s)]
*  mainstream media reporter that [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1046.56s)]
*  covers the Pentagon and [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1048.48s)]
*  the White House has any idea why? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1049.8s)]
*  No, that doesn't make any sense at [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1051.76s)]
*  all. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1053.68s)]
*  And it gets worse, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1054.2s)]
*  Hegseth brought his wife, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1055.48s)]
*  a former Fox News producer to two [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1057.2s)]
*  separate meetings with foreign [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1059.24s)]
*  military counterparts where [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1061.2s)]
*  sensitive information was discussed. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1063.08s)]
*  So this is separate from [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1065.48s)]
*  the signal chat. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1067.4s)]
*  And also the Pentagon, as we know, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1070.08s)]
*  has a top secret briefing by [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1072.04s)]
*  the Joint Chiefs of Staff on China, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1073.84s)]
*  specifically for Elon Musk, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1076.0s)]
*  who has business in China. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1077.8799999999999s)]
*  The White House though did call [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1079.84s)]
*  that off after they caught wind of [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1081.52s)]
*  it. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1083.32s)]
*  So how is Pete Hegseth handling all [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1083.84s)]
*  of this news? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1085.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, he's handling it the way you [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1087.04s)]
*  would expect him to, let's watch. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1088.48s)]
*  Well, what a big surprise that [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1089.92s)]
*  a few leakers get fired and [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1091.76s)]
*  suddenly a bunch of hit pieces [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1093.28s)]
*  come out from the same media that [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1095.0s)]
*  peddled the Russia hoax, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1096.96s)]
*  won't give back their pulitzers. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1098.52s)]
*  They got pulitzers for [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1101.04s)]
*  a bunch of lies. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1102.2s)]
*  Pulitzers for a bunch of lies and [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1103.04s)]
*  on hoaxes time and time and [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1105.52s)]
*  time again. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1107.92s)]
*  And as they peddle those lies, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1110.04s)]
*  no one ever calls them on it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1111.48s)]
*  See, this is what the media does. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1113.2s)]
*  They take anonymous sources from [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1115.3999999999999s)]
*  disgruntled former employees, and [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1117.28s)]
*  then they try to slash and [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1119.44s)]
*  burn people and [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1120.72s)]
*  ruin their reputations. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1121.52s)]
*  Not going to work with me, because [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1123.32s)]
*  we're changing the Defense [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1125.08s)]
*  Department, putting the Pentagon [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1126.6s)]
*  back in the hands of war fighters. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1128.6s)]
*  And anonymous smears from [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1130.44s)]
*  disgruntled former employees on old [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1131.88s)]
*  news doesn't matter. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1133.8400000000001s)]
*  So before I go to Cenk for [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1135.8s)]
*  comment on the clip that we just [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1136.76s)]
*  watched, now that I've seen this [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1138.0800000000002s)]
*  on a bigger screen, it does appear [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1139.72s)]
*  the Pete Hegseth sideburns are even. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1141.56s)]
*  It's just that one of them is more [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1144.4s)]
*  gray than the other, so [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1145.56s)]
*  it looks shorter than the other. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1146.3600000000001s)]
*  The important point to mention, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1147.52s)]
*  it's a big debate on Twitter right [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1148.92s)]
*  now, go ahead Cenk. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1150.44s)]
*  That's funny because I didn't know [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1151.8400000000001s)]
*  it was a big debate on Twitter and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1153.16s)]
*  I thought he's got to police [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1154.56s)]
*  those sideburns. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1156.0s)]
*  They're very long sideburns. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1157.2s)]
*  Apparently we're going back to [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1159.32s)]
*  the 1970s, maybe that's the cause [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1160.1599999999999s)]
*  of all this. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1161.24s)]
*  Okay, and it did look like he had [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1162.0s)]
*  a little bit of Easter egg on [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1163.4399999999998s)]
*  his face there. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1164.6399999999999s)]
*  So, you're all week whether you [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1165.3999999999999s)]
*  like it or not. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1167.36s)]
*  Okay, anyways, super defensive, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1168.96s)]
*  but on the other hand, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1171.0s)]
*  he's beleaguered, so [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1172.12s)]
*  I give him a pass on being defensive. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1173.4399999999998s)]
*  So look, we continue not to know [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1176.4399999999998s)]
*  why, we're not saying here we know [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1178.4399999999998s)]
*  for sure that it's Israel that are [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1180.6s)]
*  moving these chairs and stuff. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1182.6s)]
*  But we know that it's not [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1184.8s)]
*  the official reason, and [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1186.1599999999999s)]
*  there's that speculation. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1187.8000000000002s)]
*  By the way, there's other [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1189.8000000000002s)]
*  speculation, there could be other [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1190.5600000000002s)]
*  reasons, right? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1191.72s)]
*  So some of our members are [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1192.76s)]
*  speculating whether it's whiskey [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1194.3200000000002s)]
*  leaks, and I don't know that that's [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1195.72s)]
*  fair, and maybe that's the reason [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1197.68s)]
*  the mainstream media isn't giving [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1199.44s)]
*  a reason because they heard that, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1201.16s)]
*  but they don't have enough sources [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1202.8400000000001s)]
*  to confirm it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1205.24s)]
*  Yeah, can I just, okay, I don't [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1206.0400000000002s)]
*  think we should be poking fun at [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1208.68s)]
*  his substance abuse issues, okay? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1211.24s)]
*  I get that he's a baddie because [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1214.5600000000002s)]
*  he's on the other side of [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1215.96s)]
*  the political aisle. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1217.04s)]
*  Let's be kind to people who [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1218.2s)]
*  struggle with substance abuse. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1219.48s)]
*  No, I agree with that in general, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1220.84s)]
*  of course, right? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1222.84s)]
*  And we're good libs, and [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1223.92s)]
*  we're not going to hold anything [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1225.28s)]
*  against good folks who are [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1226.84s)]
*  struggling with issues. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1228.08s)]
*  But you can't be the defense [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1229.76s)]
*  secretary while you're struggling [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1230.96s)]
*  with that. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1232.32s)]
*  Well, I don't know if he is at [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1232.84s)]
*  the moment, and we don't know. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1234.08s)]
*  And we don't have any evidence that [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1235.44s)]
*  he is, and it seems like we're just [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1236.84s)]
*  poking fun at him for [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1238.28s)]
*  having substance abuse issues. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1239.1599999999999s)]
*  No, no, since there is no good [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1240.48s)]
*  explanation of what's happening, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1242.0s)]
*  and you know us, we can suss out [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1243.92s)]
*  what's really happening pretty [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1245.92s)]
*  good, right? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1247.52s)]
*  We've had a long history of this, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1248.24s)]
*  and then, hey, it turns out that [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1249.96s)]
*  was the actual reason, because they [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1251.5600000000002s)]
*  hide the real reason. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1253.3600000000001s)]
*  That's why we have to dive in and [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1254.8s)]
*  try to figure out what [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1256.72s)]
*  the real reason is, right? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1257.96s)]
*  Yeah, the real reason is Israel. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1259.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1261.3200000000002s)]
*  Okay, I would bet my money on that. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1261.8200000000002s)]
*  So that's your theory, and [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1263.1200000000001s)]
*  it's a very good theory, right? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1264.28s)]
*  And I'm just stating another [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1265.96s)]
*  theory, not because I have any [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1267.1200000000001s)]
*  information in that regard, but [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1268.4s)]
*  just because it's such a giant [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1269.8s)]
*  mystery as to why all of these [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1271.2s)]
*  things are happening at the same [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1272.72s)]
*  time. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exClR7a-Pik&t=1274.44s)]
