# FSU Student Survives Her SECOND School Shooting
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k)
*  Stephanie, good morning to you. I'm so sorry this has happened to you again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm so glad that you can join us for this conversation as difficult as it is. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=3.84s)]
*  I would imagine Stephanie that you never thought that this could happen to you again. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=8.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I never thought it would happen to me for the first time. And here we are. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=15.6s)]
*  And unfortunately, this is America for you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=21.52s)]
*  That was Stephanie Horowitz, an FSU student who has now lived through two school shootings. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=23.84s)]
*  First, Stoneman Douglas High School, Parkland, Florida. And the second one just yesterday at FSU, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=32.16s)]
*  Florida State University in which two people were killed. Tragically, her response there saying [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=38.88s)]
*  this is America is one that a lot of people had yesterday. And every time there's another shooting. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=44.32s)]
*  Stephanie also revealed to CBS how these traumatic shootings have impacted her life. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=49.92s)]
*  The reality that you're thinking every day, this could be the day when there's a school shooting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=55.2s)]
*  I mean, for a while, I had thought that I never thought that before I was 15 years old. And then [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  after surviving the Parkland school shooting at Stoneman Douglas back in 2018, I was a freshman. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=69.76s)]
*  After that day, I kind of woke up every morning thinking that it could be my last day. I was afraid [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=75.83999999999999s)]
*  for my life every step that I took. And I've come a long way over that time. And I've gotten to a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  place over these last couple of years where I didn't fear for my life anymore. And I was able [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=86.64s)]
*  to walk around campus and feel safe. And here we are yet again, and that was taken away from me for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  a second time. Yeah, and that feeling of being less safe is gonna continue being taken away from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=96.64s)]
*  Americans across the country thanks to lawmakers who refuse to take any action to curb gun violence. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=102.64s)]
*  Enter Donald Trump last night, just hours after the shooting made it clear he was more concerned [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=110.0s)]
*  about protecting gun rights than he was about protecting Americans. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=114.48s)]
*  There are any changes that you wanna see to gun legislation, anything you see broken with gun laws. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=120.72s)]
*  Well, I'm gonna have to look, I'm a big advocate of the Second Amendment. I have been from the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=126.48s)]
*  beginning, I protected it. And these things are terrible. But the gun doesn't do the shooting, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=130.56s)]
*  the people do. It's a phrase that's used probably too often. I will tell you that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=138.32s)]
*  it's a shame. We'll have more to say about it later. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=145.84s)]
*  What do you mean you say there will be more to say about it? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=148.08s)]
*  Only in terms of what happened. As far as legislation is concerned, this has been going on [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=151.36s)]
*  for a long time. I have an obligation to protect the Second Amendment. I ran on the Second Amendment [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=156.56s)]
*  among many other things. And I will always protect the Second Amendment. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=162.32s)]
*  I probably have more respect for Donald Trump, but then that moment he just said, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=166.32s)]
*  not my issue. I wasn't there, not my problem. I'm old enough that I didn't have active [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=170.32s)]
*  shooting training in school. My daughter has had that and it's like no big deal to her. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=177.6s)]
*  This is just the world that she was born into. Cenk's thoughts on I guess his reaction to it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  And even when I watch Stephanie Horowitz there, I don't know her so I don't have a baseline. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=192.08s)]
*  But I see someone who is impacted in a way that is PTSD, trauma. She's talking about when she's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  15. Now here she is again at Florida State University and it's not safe. And you can't [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  guarantee that she's safe when the next person with a gun, whether it's their mom's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  handgun that they find or a long gun. It's just this is America and it's disgusting. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=217.28s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm gonna give you some context on that in a second. Yesterday on the show I said, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=224.56s)]
*  look, about a decade ago I told you there'd be a mass shooting near you. It was inevitable [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=232.08s)]
*  because if the rules are set in a way that creates this situation, you have to change the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=238.8s)]
*  rules. The rules in this case are the laws. If you don't change the laws, you're gonna keep [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=246.72s)]
*  getting the same result over and over and over again. So then yesterday I was saying about, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=250.56s)]
*  hey, soon we're gonna see a lot of people who are talking about their second shooting. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=255.12s)]
*  So here we are now talking about her. She's talking about her second mass shooting. So all of you, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=259.52s)]
*  if you've been in an area that has had a mass shooting, I have terrible news for you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=264.32s)]
*  You'll probably get another one. If you're lucky enough that you've never been in an area there's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=267.76s)]
*  been a mass shooting. First of all, you're becoming increasingly rare. The rest of us [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  have usually experienced something along those lines. And soon you'll get one too, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=277.12s)]
*  because that's what happens when you have the wrong laws. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=282.48s)]
*  So now Trump realized this in his first term, in a terrible mass shooting. And on the first day, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=285.76s)]
*  he said, well, there's too much gun violence. We gotta do something about it. And you know what? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  A lot of the guys around here, they take money from the NRA or something or [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=295.36s)]
*  he says something along those lines. Are they too controlled by the NRA or too worried about the NRA? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=298.72s)]
*  But I'm gonna take care of it. So the next day he had a meeting with the NRA, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=303.92s)]
*  came out and said, never mind. No, gun rights are more important than the victims of these shootings. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=308.56s)]
*  I mean, he's so stupid in how transactional he is. Then why did you say, hey, they're controlled by [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=317.36s)]
*  the NRA? If you're gonna go in and meet with the NRA the next day, and you're gonna get controlled [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=323.44s)]
*  by the NRA. But that's what's so frustrating about his supporters, is that you saw that with [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=327.36s)]
*  your own eyes. A lot of them didn't, because Fox News, of course, didn't talk about that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=332.96s)]
*  Their media didn't talk about that. But for those of you who saw that with your own eyes, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=337.04s)]
*  why would you believe anything this guy says? So I mean, to Sharon's point, at this point, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=341.12s)]
*  he's not being quite as honest as Sharon wanted him to be. But he's almost getting there where [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=345.84s)]
*  he's like, yeah, yeah, dead people, I get it. But I care more about the Second Amendment rights [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=350.32s)]
*  than he cares about average American citizens. And is it because he's emotionally wedded to the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=356.32s)]
*  Second Amendment? He's shredding the Constitution in every other way, right? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=363.12s)]
*  Taining American citizens, not listening to the courts, talking about running for a third term. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=368.0s)]
*  You love the Constitution? No, you love the money, dude. You love the money that the NRA gives you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=373.36s)]
*  So what he's actually saying is, I like the money I'm getting more than I like your lives. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=378.96s)]
*  Let's be honest about it. I don't know, I've known you, Jen, 20 years and I can't count, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  I've lost count of how many times we sat here and gone through this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=390.96s)]
*  We've talked about these stories. The chances are that young woman will be in a third shooting. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=394.88s)]
*  She could very possibly be in a third shooting. She's young enough. She's got a lot of life in [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=399.76s)]
*  front of her and she could go to a baseball game, restaurant, bar. Chances are in this [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=404.4s)]
*  society where guns are so threaded throughout our culture, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=413.2s)]
*  there's a good chance that she could be in another shooting. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know, we have this perennial thing. It's like spring, every spring, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  there's like a shooting, I don't know. And I don't wanna say that nobody cares because [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=431.28s)]
*  people do care. People really, really care. I think there's a real failure in the political [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  machinery to make this issue so pivotal, so center to why we vote. You could almost make it [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=444.55999999999995s)]
*  a single issue vote. Do you like guns? And can anyone have a gun? Are you sick of your family [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=454.64s)]
*  members being threatened in the public space? Have you been touched by gun violence? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, my God, it's everywhere. And it's not just shootings like this. It's in the local news [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=466.96s)]
*  every night in Atlanta. How does the political machinery that wants to moderate gun violence, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=471.84s)]
*  make it something other than just another one of these things that we don't get around to dealing [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=481.84s)]
*  with? It's like a broken step on the back porch. It's always there every time I step on it and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  that darn thing, I'm gonna fix that one day. We just don't get around to fixing it one day. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=497.28s)]
*  And I wonder, what will it take? What will it take? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  I, Brian, when you say people do care, I agree with you. People do care, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=505.44s)]
*  the people I talk to, I care. But when those real little kids were slaughtered in Connecticut. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=516.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=523.28s)]
*  I mean, I remember where I was. I was on a ladder in St. Louis, putting something up. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=523.84s)]
*  And I think it was John Miller, hesitated but delivered the news, kind of bracing the audience [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=528.88s)]
*  for, and these are real small kids and there's this many that we believe. He already had it [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=536.24s)]
*  confirmed. But we just, I could not look at their pictures after seeing them one time. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=543.52s)]
*  And on the anniversaries, I mean, it's just horrific. And yet, if anything would spur us [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=549.12s)]
*  to vote and be committed, look how many of us are parents. I mean, I don't think you have to be a [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=556.72s)]
*  parent, but I don't get it. I really don't get it. And if you're right and Cenk's right and it's [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=563.12s)]
*  gonna touch everyone. I mean, I chills went up my spine, Cenk, when you said, and if you haven't [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  been, I haven't been. And I'm, yeah, that hit home. If you're now on people who are two furs and then [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=574.4s)]
*  this is banana. So why, forget the politicians for a minute and their manipulation. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=584.4000000000001s)]
*  Why haven't people said, hell no? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=589.6s)]
*  Yeah, so well, the thing is we keep saying hell no, but no one ever listens. And that goes to the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=593.2s)]
*  frustration of the American people on all the issues. So look, there's two different factors [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=602.24s)]
*  at play here. There's the hard right that says don't move an inch on gun rights ever, ever, ever, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  right? And then there's the money. And then NRA bought a lot of our politicians for a long, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=614.32s)]
*  long time. They actually used to also fund the Democratic Party, give credit to the Democratic [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=619.2s)]
*  Party that they finally stopped taking the NRA money. And then all of a sudden they were for [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=623.44s)]
*  gun control, right? So you could see it as soon as the donor money goes away, they become much [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=627.6s)]
*  more active on that particular issue, right? So the Republicans are completely bought and paid for [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=632.88s)]
*  100%, the entire party. They're all corrupt on this issue. Now they also do have voters in that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=638.16s)]
*  direction. And so for some of those voters, they can't deal with reality. Why do you think Alex [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=644.0s)]
*  Jones did that ludicrous thing with, they were crisis actors and the shooting didn't really [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=649.12s)]
*  happen? Because it's so hard to defend extreme gun rights when you see kids slaughtered. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=654.16s)]
*  So you have to pretend it didn't happen so that you could live with yourself. Even if you're an [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=661.36s)]
*  Alex Jones fan, and even if you're the most zealot gun rights owner, when you see those dead children, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=665.68s)]
*  you have to pretend that it's not, no, no, no, no. It wasn't that we just hand out guns like [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=672.2399999999999s)]
*  they're candy to everyone, including the mentally ill, right? It's not that we don't have, like, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=678.64s)]
*  our laws are insane in how permissive they are, right? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=683.76s)]
*  No, it must be that it didn't happen. That's why they did that nonsense. So now when it gets to the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=688.7199999999999s)]
*  corruption issue, that's super real because over 90% of Americans in one poll was 97% of Americans [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=694.08s)]
*  want universal background checks. So it's not a zero one or zero, it's not a binary thing. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not, hey, you either take away all guns or you have no gun control at all, right? So over 90% [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=708.48s)]
*  of gun owners want universal background checks, because they're not planning to kill anyone. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=714.64s)]
*  So they're like, I don't mind if you know the serial number of my gun. In fact, I want you to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=720.0s)]
*  know the serial number because in case it's stolen, I want it back, right? So the only people who [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=723.52s)]
*  don't want universal background checks are either people paid by the NRA or criminals, like terrible, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=728.96s)]
*  terrible criminals or people that want to be criminals, 97%. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  No, we can't get it done. And so, and then red flag laws, very popular. I mean, the bare minimum [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=743.92s)]
*  when people have been adjudicated to be so mentally ill that they might harm themselves or others, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=751.76s)]
*  do not let them buy a gun. Of course, of course, can't get it passed in so many places. Why? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=757.52s)]
*  That's the corruption. Because when you go to the Republicans, you go, hey, even though 90% of your [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=764.48s)]
*  voters want this, they go, yeah, but 90% of my donors don't. And so in so many cases, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=769.04s)]
*  it's corporate Democrats and corporate Republicans working together and good cop, bad cop, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=776.96s)]
*  as we've talked about a million times on this show. But in this particular case, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=780.4000000000001s)]
*  since the Democrats stopped taking donor money from the gun industry, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=784.4000000000001s)]
*  this one is 100% Republican politicians' faults. So if you hate the mass shootings, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=788.96s)]
*  look, you can say, hey, I don't hate them so much that I want higher taxes or I want this or that or [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=797.0400000000001s)]
*  whatever it might be. But understand that when you vote for a Republican, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=801.84s)]
*  you are actually voting for mass shootings. Because every one of them votes against every [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=805.68s)]
*  gun control, no matter how reasonable and no matter how much the American people want it, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=811.84s)]
*  they will always vote against it because they are deeply corrupt. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=816.72s)]
*  So that's just one of the consequences. Maybe you could live with it, but I can't. That's why I [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=820.24s)]
*  don't vote for Republicans. I almost think that it's too nuanced of an issue for voters. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, we had a recent presidential election where both candidates bragged about their gun [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=831.76s)]
*  ownership. And it still didn't make a difference because folks here in Georgia thought these [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=838.0s)]
*  people were going to take their guns away. And so if you say, I'm a hunter, I love hunting, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=845.12s)]
*  here I am hunting with my dog. Kamala Harris talking about owning a handgun. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=851.84s)]
*  The message becomes these people are taking your guns away. And so then Democrats are faced with, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=861.36s)]
*  no, I'm trying to get universal background checks. So right there you have now split a hair, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=867.84s)]
*  and it's almost too nuanced for voters. And I wonder if it's just an issue that people can't [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=874.24s)]
*  quite wrap their heads around, that there are limits to gun ownership that we could all live with, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=881.76s)]
*  whether you like guns or not. There's something we can live with. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  There's some middle ground there. Cenk, is it too complicated of an issue? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=893.12s)]
*  Cenk Rousey No, it's always about, look, they have such a megaphone, all these politicians, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=896.8s)]
*  especially a presidential candidate. You could just pound the message home and you could make [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=902.48s)]
*  it crystal clear. And you could say, hey, listen, if you're Kamala Harris, hey, listen, I have a gun. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=906.56s)]
*  This is not taking away guns because you're not gonna take my gun. I'm not gonna take my gun away, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=912.0s)]
*  right? But at the same time, I despise mass shootings, and I'm a reasonable person. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=916.64s)]
*  And I wanna do what the American people want, universal background checks and red flag laws. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  So if you're saying no, I don't want those laws, then you're saying you're for mass shootings. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=925.92s)]
*  So let's have an argument about it, okay? When I have an argument, take my gun, you wanna take [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=931.52s)]
*  guns away. Well, I have a gun. How many times do I have to say it? Are you stupid, right? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=937.52s)]
*  So there's a way to make your argument super forcefully and drill it into people's heads. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=942.4s)]
*  But that's another giant problem, which is Democrats are afraid of their own shadow. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=947.8399999999999s)]
*  So they're like, my God, it's a gun issue, run, run. Now don't run, stand your ground and fight [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  back politically, rhetorically, and win the goddamn argument. Otherwise, this is never gonna win. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=958.4799999999999s)]
*  This is never gonna end. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=964.0799999999999s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lVEC7OgX_k&t=968.64s)]
