"It was a stunning, audacious attack whose widespread effects are only just becoming clear.
Ukraine managed to smuggle 117 aerial drones on the backs of trucks that deposited them at the perimeter of four Russian air bases ‚Äî one of them deep inside Siberia 2,500 miles from Ukraine's borders, according to Ukrainian officials.
While there are differing accounts on the extent of the ensuing damage of Sunday‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpiderweb‚Äù operation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 40 Russian aircraft ‚Äî 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers ‚Äî were hit. Ukraine's security service, the SBU, put the estimated cost to the Kremlin at $7 billion."

# Wildly Successful Ukrainian Attack Leaves Putin Stunned
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58)
*  This is a Ukrainian drone flying out of a truck in southeastern Siberia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=0.0s)]
*  2,700 miles from the front line [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=5.68s)]
*  targeting Putin's warplanes deep in the heart of Russian territory [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=7.94s)]
*  Ukrainian officials said it was part of a clandestine attack that saw four military airports hit [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=12.52s)]
*  Destroying more than 40 warplanes in the biggest blow of the war against Moscow's long-range bomber fleet [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=18.56s)]
*  In what's being described as a big blow to Russia's air capability [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=25.2s)]
*  Ukraine launched a successful drone attack deep within Russian territory [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=30.28s)]
*  In fact here are some more details on how it all went down before we get into what this all means and the potential ramifications [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=35.52s)]
*  Let's take a look the attack known as operation spiders web hit 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=42.32s)]
*  causing an estimated seven billion dollars worth of damage [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  In total Ukrainian officials said a hundred and seventeen drones were used and that the operation [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=54.72s)]
*  Took more than a year and a half of planning the operation didn't involve these long-range drones [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=60.48s)]
*  We should become used to seeing launched from Ukraine instead [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=65.56s)]
*  These were small drones which were launched from [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=69.08s)]
*  Containers on trucks we don't yet have the details of exactly how this happened the SBU has not revealed it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=73.44s)]
*  It has shown some photographs of what these containers looked like [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  Which were clearly loaded onto the trucks and the way that the drones were concealed within these containers [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=83.88s)]
*  We don't know exactly how they got into Russia [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=90.61999999999999s)]
*  But it seems to be that Ukraine has taken advantage of commercial networks to deliver [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  A weapon deep inside the territory of its enemy in a way that the Russian security services and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=102.36s)]
*  Military have been stunned by and were absolutely not ready for [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=110.2s)]
*  Now reports indicate that these drones were smuggled into Russia over several months [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=114.68s)]
*  That's what's being put out there by Ukraine [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=119.52s)]
*  Ukraine also claims that 41 Russian warplanes were taken out in what they're calling operation spiderweb [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=122.48s)]
*  But that number to be clear has not been confirmed yet, so I want everyone to be aware of that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=129.04s)]
*  This is what Ukraine is claiming [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=135.2s)]
*  Ukraine attacked five remote Russian airfields in this attack one of them being in Siberia [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=137.64s)]
*  Now they also claim that some of the bomber planes that were destroyed are no longer even being [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=143.24s)]
*  Manufactured by Russia and that these type of aircraft are the same aircraft that could deliver a nuclear weapon [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=149.2s)]
*  So that is a big deal if [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  Confirmed to be true Russia hasn't confirmed by the way how many aircraft were hit but they did concede that they suffered damage from [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=159.68s)]
*  Ukraine's attack the Ukraine didn't give the United States any advance warning that they intended to do this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=167.0s)]
*  In fact a senior CBS senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs posted on X [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  That the administration sources told CBS News that the White House wasn't aware of today's large-scale drone attack by Ukraine on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=179.24s)]
*  Russian military aircraft [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=186.2s)]
*  and also says that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=188.4s)]
*  US did not share intel with Zelensky and his team for the operation [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=192.16s)]
*  Administration sources tell me Ukraine gathered its own information [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=198.64s)]
*  The Ukrainians also claim that they use their own weapons and as a result of that didn't feel [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  That they needed to talk to the United States prior to launching this attack [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=208.48s)]
*  But Ukraine is asking the US for more air defense systems that Trump by the way has not agreed to provide them with [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=212.58s)]
*  At least not yet at the same time the United States [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=220.58s)]
*  I believe would have an interest in denying they had anything to do with this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=223.94s)]
*  There's no indication that they did have anything to do with this at the moment. Let me be clear [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=228.06s)]
*  but if they did I think they'd have an interest in denying it because [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=231.94s)]
*  Look [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  It's it's difficult to talk about it because Ukraine obviously [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=238.26000000000002s)]
*  Should be able to defend itself Russia is the aggressor here Russia refuses to sign a peace deal [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=242.17999999999998s)]
*  They are standing in the way of peace in this area. However at the same time [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=248.78s)]
*  We're entering dangerous territory when [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=254.14s)]
*  Commercial supply chains are now being utilized in order to carry out military attacks and I'm curious what you think Cenk [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so a lot of things first. Let's start with drones [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=264.38s)]
*  Okay, the Pentagon spending what a giant waste look at what simple drones did to seven billion dollars worth of equipment and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=268.98s)]
*  planes in Russia, okay [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=277.38s)]
*  That's just a Ukrainian. So you have any idea how many drones the Chinese have? Oh [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=280.06s)]
*  We have air superiority. Oh, we have giant aircraft carriers. They're all sitting ducks [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=284.86s)]
*  They're gonna get to them somehow [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=290.7s)]
*  so oh [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=292.7s)]
*  Stop wasting all of our money on defense spending on these giant projects [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=294.34s)]
*  That's that are all sitting ducks. I agree [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=300.41999999999996s)]
*  I think that our taxpayer dollars should be spent on actual defense [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=303.46s)]
*  Meaning now that we know how effectively these small drones can be used like smuggled into a country and used to attack said country [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  We should actually use defense for defense of the United States, right? Yeah, that's a novel thought. I know right [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean instead of going on the offense for Israel [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=323.66s)]
*  Which is pretty much the only thing our military ever does. Oh [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=326.5s)]
*  Did you know during the Iraq war [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  This Saddam Hussein was a great opponent of al-qaeda terrible guy al-qaeda terrible, but two things can be true at the same time [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=333.5s)]
*  He would murder anyone that was in al-qaeda al-qaeda attacked us not Iraq [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=341.38s)]
*  But at the time the Israelis said that Iraq was their number one enemy. So we had to go to war with Iraq [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=345.82000000000005s)]
*  Okay now Iran has not attacked us at all, but the number one enemy of Israel is Iran [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=352.18s)]
*  So they're pushing for war with Iran our military is not for us. It's for Israel. Okay, so yes [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=357.5s)]
*  I would love for them to do defense. Anyway now back to Ukraine and Russia. So Anna's right super mixed [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  Really tough now on the one hand the Russians invaded Ukraine if I'm Ukraine [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=371.14s)]
*  I'm not gonna have a lot of boundaries for how I deal with the Russians over 13,000 civilians killed already in Ukraine [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=375.42s)]
*  Right on the other hand you attack this deep inside of Russia and they're gonna want to counterattack and they're not gonna want to get [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=382.1s)]
*  To peace so on the third hand you have to show some sort of leverage. Otherwise Russia is gonna think hey [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=388.54s)]
*  You know what I could just run roughshod over Ukraine and there's no consequences exactly [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=394.14s)]
*  So now they think that there's going to be some consequences on the other hand. They're about to go to Turkey [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=398.94s)]
*  Today to work out a peace deal and obviously the Russians are now not in a mood for peace look [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=404.14s)]
*  It's this is a difficult story to have a firm [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=410.76s)]
*  opinion on because [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=415.04s)]
*  honestly Russia [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=417.6s)]
*  Made it appear and it was very clear to me that the Russians believe that victory was inevitable [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=419.68s)]
*  They've been taking control of more and more territory in Ukraine [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=425.64s)]
*  Ukraine has been losing this war and so why would Russia agree to in good faith? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=431.12s)]
*  Engage in peace negotiations if they're winning the war and they can take over even more territory [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=436.86s)]
*  so with something as [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=441.7s)]
*  Effective as the attack that Ukraine carried out I can understand the justification at the same time though [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=444.66s)]
*  I don't want to live in a world where commercial supply chains are used to carry out acts of violence and war [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  No, I'm very worried about it. That's right. So more mixed news [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=457.34000000000003s)]
*  So I was on with a supporter of the Russian government on counterpoints on Al Arabia earlier today and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=461.26000000000005s)]
*  we'll put that up on tyt.com slash press and so [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=468.14000000000004s)]
*  He he said this is a terrible dastardly attack and and then he threatened war with Poland and Romania next [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=472.18s)]
*  That was interesting. We'll come back to that. Okay [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=480.02000000000004s)]
*  Then later he said it was no big deal. They didn't really hurt us [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=483.12s)]
*  So I asked him which one is it Sergey was it no big deal or catastrophic? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=486.46000000000004s)]
*  Because you seem to be implying both right? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=491.42s)]
*  So the reality is no the Russians are super mad about this because it shows that they are not invincible [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=493.78000000000003s)]
*  And so that's a big big problem for the Russians. They thought they were invisible and let's not forget [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=500.94000000000005s)]
*  We're talking about a mill a nuclear power as well that Russia has nuclear weapons [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=506.14000000000004s)]
*  So it is risky to carry out an attack like this as well [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=510.86s)]
*  Because how is Russia planning to respond in fact in that same interview he then threatened nuclear of course [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=514.58s)]
*  Okay, so [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=520.94s)]
*  Now on the one hand [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=522.86s)]
*  That's a [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=525.9000000000001s)]
*  They're now threatening Roman [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=527.26s)]
*  Poland and Romania and they're threatening nuclear war and they're the ones who did the invasion full stop [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=529.38s)]
*  We got into a discussion about hey should NATO could get close to Russia's borders yet [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=535.86s)]
*  No matter what you think of that Russia attacking three times inside other sovereign governments is [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=540.58s)]
*  Inexcusable right so Russia is definitely wrong [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  Definitely in this war period right now that doesn't mean that we have a great answer for what to do going forward [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=553.1600000000001s)]
*  Because they are a nuclear power and they are unhinged and Putin thinks that he's the king of the world and anytime [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=559.84s)]
*  Anyone challenges power gets even angrier and then this guy hilariously talked about how there isn't enough freedom in Ukraine [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=567.28s)]
*  If anybody opposes Putin they wind up tripping out of a window in Russia you're talking about freedom [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=575.32s)]
*  It's sham elections and state a dictatorship for Putin now, so [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  We're stuck. I don't want to spend any more money on that war and I don't want that war to continue [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=585.44s)]
*  I don't want any more Ukrainian civilians or soldiers dying or Russian citizens [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=591.4000000000001s)]
*  I was gonna say or soldiers, but there's barely Russian soldiers there [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=595.96s)]
*  So if you don't know this the Russians are [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=599.76s)]
*  Will not conscript people into their military because Putin is worried that the war will become much more unpopular if [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=603.08s)]
*  He drafts people and forces them to go fight in Ukraine [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=610.64s)]
*  That's why they're bringing in North Koreans to die for them and then again this Russian spokesperson was basically said no no [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=614.12s)]
*  The North Koreans want to die for us. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm sure yeah those North Korean soldiers really signed up for that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZ-4WtfA58&t=620.28s)]
