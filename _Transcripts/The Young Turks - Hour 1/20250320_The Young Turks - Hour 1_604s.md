# Trump RAGES After This Federal Reserve Interest Rate Announcement
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ)
*  Inflation has started to move up now, we think, partly in response to tariffs, and there may be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a delay in further progress over the course of this year. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=7.04s)]
*  Despite mounting pressure from President Donald Trump to have the Federal Reserve lower interest [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=9.84s)]
*  rates, Jerome Powell, head of the Federal Reserve, is resisting in that pressure and essentially [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=18.8s)]
*  pointing to the uncertainty in the economy as a result of Donald Trump's tariffs, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=25.12s)]
*  as his reason for wanting to hold off on cutting interest rates. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  Now, it wasn't just the fact that Donald Trump's tariffs have kind of caused chaos in the economy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=35.2s)]
*  It's also the fact that, well, if you look at consumer sentiment, and more importantly, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=41.28s)]
*  if you look at where inflation currently is, well, they're not hitting the targets that they [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=45.84s)]
*  initially wanted to hit. And so out of an abundance of caution, the Federal Reserve [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=51.52s)]
*  has decided to keep interest rates exactly where they've been. So the Fed's move keeps [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  the benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.50%. Now again, Powell defended the central bank's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=61.28s)]
*  decision to keep interest rates unchanged by citing the unusually elevated uncertainty [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  that has resulted from Trump's tariffs and trade policies. Take a look. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=77.36s)]
*  You may have seen that goods inflation moved up pretty significantly in the first two months [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=81.04s)]
*  of the year. Trying to track that back to actual tariff increases given what was tariffed and what [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  was not, very, very challenging. So some of it, the answer is clearly some of it, a good part of it [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  is coming from tariffs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  And look, financial institutions, Wall Street types, people like Trump, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=101.36s)]
*  they love the sugar high from those interest rate cuts. They love the cheap money. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=110.64s)]
*  They love it so much. I mean, without the cheap money, how are we gonna get the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=115.28s)]
*  overly inflated assets in the stock market? How are we gonna have the growing inequality? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=119.92s)]
*  Okay, so Trump responded to Jerome Powell in the way you would expect him to. So on [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=125.84s)]
*  Truth Social, he writes, the Fed would be much better off cutting rates as US tariffs start to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=131.36s)]
*  transition, ease their way into the economy, do the right thing. April 2nd is liberation day in America. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=138.56s)]
*  Right, so Trump is likely going to get what he wants, even though [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=147.12s)]
*  Powell did not provide interest rate cuts this time around. He did mention [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=151.2s)]
*  that he still expects two instances of the Fed cutting interest rates in the coming year. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=158.32s)]
*  And by the way, one of the reasons why is because of what's currently happening with the banks. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  And that isn't really being talked about a lot. One of the best journalists, in my opinion, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=171.2s)]
*  on this matter is Nomi Prins, a guest that we've had on the show multiple times. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  But she used to be at Wall Street. She worked for Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, and then she [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=181.12s)]
*  decided, yeah, I'm gonna quit this and I'm gonna be a whistleblower. And so I have a tremendous [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=187.28s)]
*  amount of respect for her. And her analysis is just on point. So regardless of what happens with [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump's tariffs or inflation, I do think the Fed is going to cut interest rates twice in the coming [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=199.68s)]
*  year because of the banks really suffering right now. They're drowning in unrealized bond [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=206.16s)]
*  and commercial real estate loan losses. They need that cheap money. They need that sugar high, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=214.32s)]
*  and they're expecting it. So as Nomi Prins reports, according to the FDIC, unrealized losses on [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=220.56s)]
*  investment securities hit $620 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. A $150 billion jump [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=226.96s)]
*  in just months. Banks loaded up on long term bonds when rates were low. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=235.92s)]
*  Now those bonds are worth far less, locking them into deep losses. And by the way, the other issue [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=242.0s)]
*  is banks give out loans and there's a little bit of an issue right now when it comes to defaults. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=248.56s)]
*  Defaults are rising. Loan delinquencies are climbing with 3.6% of outstanding debt, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=255.92s)]
*  now delinquent. And that's according to the New York Fed's latest Household Debt and Credit Report. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=262.16s)]
*  That's the highest level since 2020 that the reading reflects growing financial strain on [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=267.92s)]
*  consumers and adding pressure on banks already facing unrealized losses. So this is why despite [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=274.56s)]
*  the grim news on inflation, the Fed still believes that they're going to cut interest rates this year. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  And Nomi Prins is predicting that there will be 100 basis points of cuts in this coming year. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=289.36s)]
*  So the obvious reason is the slowing US economy. The hidden reason, again, the banks. Markets are [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=296.32s)]
*  desperate for cheaper money. Wall Street needs an adrenaline shot. On top of that, the Fed doesn't [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=303.36s)]
*  want to deal with a banking crisis. And so that's really the hidden and main reason why the Fed is [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=309.2s)]
*  likely going to cut interest rates in the coming year on two different occasions by as much as 100 [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=316.4s)]
*  basis points. Because they don't want a financial collapse. They don't want to deal with the banking [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  crisis. And that the banks are in a lot of trouble right now. If you listen to their earnings calls, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  they're freaking out. This economy is run on cheap money. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=331.67999999999995s)]
*  And the second you try to correct that, things start falling apart. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  And by the way, of course, Americans, ordinary American workers are drowning in debt. Consumer [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=343.12s)]
*  debt is at an all time high. Auto loan delinquencies defaults have risen significantly because a lot of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  those auto loans happen to be subprime loans. Things are not good at all, economically speaking. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  And I know we all like to point to one president or one administration that's at fault for this. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=363.28s)]
*  But things really became detached from reality in our economic system following the 2008 economic [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=369.44s)]
*  collapse. The quantitative easing that took place, quantitative easing I should say, that took place [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  following the 2008 economic collapse. The Fed's response to the economic collapse was, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=383.52s)]
*  give the banks cheap money, give them cheap money. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=388.32s)]
*  And that distorted the market in many ways. That led to asset bubbles, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  that haven't really popped yet. I don't know if they ever will considering the fact that the Fed [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=396.8s)]
*  just keeps printing money. So this is not, in my opinion, the right solution to the problem that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=402.32s)]
*  this economic system faces. But nonetheless, we'll get interest rate cuts and people will load up on [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=408.24s)]
*  more debt, including corporations. We'll see all sorts of weird distortions in the economy as a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  result. Also, the central bank approved plans to slow the reduction of its $6.8 trillion asset [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=423.6s)]
*  portfolio. Beginning in April, the Fed will allow $5 billion in treasury securities to mature every [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=431.76000000000005s)]
*  month without reinvesting the proceeds into new securities. And that's down from the current pace [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=438.24s)]
*  of $25 billion. So they're slowing the tightening of the banking system. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  Slowing the tightening that they had previously committed to. And if you don't know what that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=451.68s)]
*  all means, let me explain. So when the Federal Reserve buys debt instruments like treasury notes [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=456.8s)]
*  or mortgage-backed securities, it's basically seeking to increase their price or the price of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=463.04s)]
*  said securities while signaling a looser monetary policy, which financial institutions, corporations, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  they love that. And it's a policy meant to support the economy. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=477.92s)]
*  On the other hand, when the Fed sells these assets, it's considered a policy tightening approach [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  that constrains financial conditions and asset values. But if you think this is monetary [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  tightening by the Fed, what they're saying about allowing $5 billion in treasury securities to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=494.88s)]
*  mature every month, you should rethink that notion. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  Because again, as Nomi Prince mentions, the Fed is sitting on a $6.7 trillion book of assets, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=503.92s)]
*  of which $4.2 trillion is in treasuries. Realistically, $5 billion or $0 is pretty [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=512.24s)]
*  much the same thing when you consider the grand scheme of these numbers here, right? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=521.52s)]
*  When you're talking about $6.7 trillion, $5 billion a month is really not that big of a deal. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=525.52s)]
*  And as she notes, optics called and the Fed seemingly answered. So it's really just about [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=532.08s)]
*  optics that this isn't real monetary tightening at all. So there you have it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=537.2s)]
*  If you're looking forward to lower interest rates, great. If you think those lower interest rates [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=543.6s)]
*  will make it easier for you to buy a home, you're wrong, because that will almost definitely lead to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=547.12s)]
*  bidding wars. That'll drive up the price of housing. Lower interest rates is not the best [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=552.96s)]
*  solution for this housing market that's crippling a lot of first time home buyers. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=558.16s)]
*  Now, low interest rates when it comes to your mortgage is great. I'm not [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=565.28s)]
*  completely discounting that. We need to build houses. That's what's leading to the increase [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  of housing costs. And lowering interest rates is only going to bring back the era of bidding wars. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=573.92s)]
*  So regardless of what happens with the Federal Reserve, I feel like ordinary Americans [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  lose anyway. And at the end of the day, the Fed is not working on behalf of you. They're [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84zUB39FCQ&t=585.84s)]
