The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Elon Musk Gifted A Golden Chainsaw at CPAC by Argentina's President
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY)
*  President, President Malay has a gift for me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=0.0s)]
*  Javier Malay from Argentina, you guys know who that is, right? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  Why don't we bring him out? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=6.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=10.96s)]
*  Cool. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=11.92s)]
*  Anyway, and I literally I saw the New York Times op-ed that's like [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=31.92s)]
*  conservatives are the cool kids again. I'm gonna have to take your word for that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=35.44s)]
*  But anyway, that was actually the president of Argentina coming out to give [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=40.32s)]
*  Elon Musk a golden chainsaw. And I think it's a great symbol for our time, not the symbol they [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=44.0s)]
*  mean it to be. It's supposed to be like he's gonna shred bureaucracy. But no, I think one of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=50.64s)]
*  world's extractive elites handing another extractive elite a golden tool is actually a great symbol of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=55.440000000000005s)]
*  how the economy works these days. But anyway, we've talked a lot about Elon Musk and all of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=61.52s)]
*  the damage he's doing. But let's talk about Javier Malay as well, because he decided to get [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=66.96s)]
*  in a little bit of the action that Donald Trump and his family have been doing recently. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=72.39999999999999s)]
*  And there I am talking about crypto. But before we get into the whole crypto scam, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=76.39999999999999s)]
*  Cenk, I think the last thing we needed these days was the president of Argentina getting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=81.83999999999999s)]
*  involved with Elon Musk. What do you make of this alliance? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  Janko- One of these days they're gonna pull a Hegseth. Remember how Hegseth threw the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  axe in the middle of New York City and missed and hit somebody in the band? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=94.16s)]
*  Okay, they're gonna be like golden chainsaw. No, there goes the president of Argentina, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Jesus Christ. And then you know what's gonna happen, the crowd's gonna cheer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=103.84s)]
*  Okay, but there's something super important in this story. So the crypto scam that they [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=107.92s)]
*  ran in Argentina is headed in our direction times 1000. So John, explain that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  Janko- Yeah, 100%. And that beheading was just trolling. It wasn't serious. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=117.44s)]
*  But and then also Musk, you should play with that chainsaw. And I know what you're thinking, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=122.24s)]
*  you're on like 30 different drugs. Give it a try, just to have a little fun. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=126.24s)]
*  But anyway, let's talk about that scam. So Millay posted on Twitter about another one of these [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=129.92s)]
*  meme coins. This one is Libra. And he said it was designed to spur, quote, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=136.24s)]
*  economic growth by funding small businesses and startups. The world wants to invest in Argentina. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=140.8s)]
*  Now you can't see the tweet anymore. It's been deleted. You're probably wondering, well, why [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=147.76s)]
*  was it deleted? Because what happened to this meme coin is something that happens to basically [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=151.36s)]
*  every single one of them. The value spiked and then it collapsed. Some people made a whole lot [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=157.52s)]
*  of money. A lot of people lost everything and that's what happened. According to the Wall Street [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  Journal, $4 billion worth of value was wiped off of the coin. We have an example of how this worked [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  for one individual, a man named Hayden Davis. He claims that he advises the president [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  on crypto related projects. He also claims that he was advisor on the Libra meme coin project itself. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=179.36s)]
*  And he used a project called a practice called sniping on this particular meme coin. That's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=185.28s)]
*  when you use bots to scan blockchain transactions so that you can conduct really fast buying and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=190.0s)]
*  selling to make big profits. And that's controversial because oftentimes insiders [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=195.12s)]
*  who have prior knowledge of when these coins are going to be launched, they can snipe ahead of the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=200.96s)]
*  token officially launched when the price is much lower. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=205.52s)]
*  And then as the plebes, the peasants get in and they start buying it because either Donald Trump [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=208.4s)]
*  tells them they should or the president of Argentina puts out a tweet and they're like, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=213.68s)]
*  I like these people, I trust them. I'll put the future of my family's finances in their hands. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=217.52s)]
*  They then buy it up. The initial snipers who've already made a ton of money at that point, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  they sell it. The value plummets because there's no demand anymore and the money has been transferred [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=226.4s)]
*  successfully from regular people to the elites once again. Now, Malay says he shouldn't be held [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=231.68s)]
*  responsible for anybody who lost money there. He says he has no ties to Libra and that Davis, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  the guy we talked about has no ties to him. He claims that he deleted the post after learning [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  more about the project. Good that he did a little bit of research after promoting it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, he said I didn't promote it. What I did was I shared it. It's not the same. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=254.24s)]
*  So he didn't promote it. He just shared it and said that it would spur economic growth by funding [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=259.68s)]
*  small businesses and startups, which is both that's promoting it and endorsing it. But anyway, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=267.2s)]
*  the money's gone. You're not getting that back. And so this obviously I think strikes a lot of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=274.72s)]
*  people as similar to what happened with Donald Trump's coin. Now, so far as we know, Malay doesn't [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=279.12s)]
*  have a massive ownership stake in this or whatever as was the case with Donald Trump. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=284.48s)]
*  Donald Trump made most of the money that was taken from his followers there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=288.32s)]
*  But still seeing like two presidents inside of one month doing what looked like a pump and dump [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=292.24s)]
*  is hardly great. Cenk, what do you make of this? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=298.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of terms here like pulling the rug. And that's what they did in this case. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=300.4s)]
*  So everybody comes in and then the insiders and even with the Trump meme coin, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=305.6s)]
*  it's mainly insiders that are reaping all the money. And I'm gonna explain that to you in a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=310.48s)]
*  second because it's devastating, devastating. So but as I saw that golden chainsaw and them [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=315.44s)]
*  putzing around with it, I thought if I'm my judge, I wake up every day going nailed it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=323.2s)]
*  Man, I made that movie Idiocracy and just almost word for word. So Mike, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=330.16s)]
*  tip of the hat to your brother. Okay, so they're gonna one day they're gonna pull that chainsaw [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=336.96s)]
*  and then somebody's gonna get hurt. And then I don't know. Anyways, now to the important stuff. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=342.24s)]
*  Donald Trump's meme coin peaked at around $15 billion in value. Now, if you know crypto, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=348.72s)]
*  and I've talked to experts on it, they laugh. The meme coin's a joke. It's nothing but a scam. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=356.0s)]
*  It's nothing but a scam. There is no other thing. Okay, so the only question is who's getting [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  scammed? It has no value and it's not like it's Bitcoin. Bitcoin's a different animal. I don't [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=369.2s)]
*  wanna get into the huge discussion. The meme coins are trash, right? So the people who get [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  in in the beginning, they get in at very low and then they hype it up to their audiences. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=380.24s)]
*  Oh my God, you gotta get into this meme coin. Everybody's gonna get into the meme coin. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=384.8s)]
*  You get all the way up to the goddamn president. And in fact, this is our president's meme coin. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=387.84s)]
*  So it went, Trump's went all the way up to 15 billion. You know what it is now? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=392.96s)]
*  It's still hanging in there at 3.3 billion. So that means about $12 billion evaporated. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=397.44s)]
*  But wait, is that real money or fake? No, no, it's real money. It's Trump fans who bought high [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  and then had the rug pulled out from underneath them and then it crashes. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=411.44s)]
*  So that $12 billion went straight into Donald Trump and his insider's pockets. And where did [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  it come from? It didn't come from almost anyone on the left. So we're looking at it and laughing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=422.48s)]
*  But since we're libs, we're not even laughing. We're like, guys, don't, don't, it's a robbery. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=427.12s)]
*  Don't walk in there on purpose. Who do you think they're robbing? They're not robbing us, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  they're robbing you. So $12 billion in MAGA from regular people, most of the people who [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  invested in that meme coin, bought $100 or less because they don't have a lot of money. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=442.8s)]
*  And all of it is gone now in the pockets of Trump insiders. By the way, Melania's total BS garbage [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=448.4s)]
*  trash coin peaked at 2 billion. For what? For what? What? Come on, guys. And now it's at 666 [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=455.28s)]
*  million. It's actually worth, my opinion, all of this is my opinion, $0 is worth $0, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=466.0s)]
*  zero. So another 1.4 billion from MAGA, not from the left, from MAGA evaporated, went from the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=473.36s)]
*  poor and middle class to some of the richest people in the country. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=481.52000000000004s)]
*  Right. First of all, I gotta ask you guys, did you catch a name on the golden chainsaw that a [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=485.04s)]
*  Husqvarna, a craftsman, where? Because I didn't know they were out there and I'm gonna get my [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=489.04s)]
*  hands on one of those things because they're only going to appreciate. Make a meme coin out of it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=493.44s)]
*  My mom, she was watching TV when I was a little kid and the Franklin mint commercial came on. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  And my mom bought a plate, I think, with Gerald Ford's face on it. And she's like, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=509.35999999999996s)]
*  it was 64.95 and this thing is gonna be worth something and it's gonna appreciate in value. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=515.04s)]
*  And I have this plate and she hook line and sinker with the Frank. This is the cryptocurrency. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqRxnnDEqYY&t=520.88s)]
