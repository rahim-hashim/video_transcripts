# Turkish President Erdogan Jails Main Election Opponent Istanbul's Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw)
*  Protests in Turkey reaching a boiling point. Street demonstrators clashing violently with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=0.0s)]
*  police after the main political rival of the nation's president, Tayyip Erdogan, was detained. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=7.0s)]
*  Turkish police blasting crowd with water cannons in Izmir and using tear gas to break up protests [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=13.16s)]
*  in the capital city of Ankara. Despite a ban on demonstrations, thousands also flooding [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=18.76s)]
*  the streets in Istanbul over what they call the undemocratic detention of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Emamoglu. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=26.16s)]
*  All right, this is a huge story. Elon Musk plays into it in a little bit as well. I'm a little [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=31.76s)]
*  worried that this is maybe foreshadowing for our future, I hope not, here in the US. But Erdogan, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=40.24s)]
*  it looks like, is in the middle of trying to end democracy in Turkey. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=46.96s)]
*  I love to see the Turkish people fighting back peacefully, but aggressively and saying, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=51.44s)]
*  no, you're not going to extinguish our voice. We're Turks, and we're not going to meekly go [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=58.16s)]
*  into that good night. So now let's go to Politico to explain the situation. We'll jump around in some [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=64.32s)]
*  major news sources here to explain what happened, including how Elon played into this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=70.0s)]
*  Turkey took a sharp turn toward a full autocracy on Sunday when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  main political rival, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Emamoglu, was jailed and made a major crackdown [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=80.8s)]
*  on the opposition. And so I'm going to explain all of it to you guys, but that's obviously the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=86.16s)]
*  beginning of it. A court on Sunday formally arrested Emamoglu on corruption charges pending trial, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  and a step to the opposition are used as a politically motivated coup. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=98.0s)]
*  He was also formally removed from office as mayor of Turkey's biggest city. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=101.52s)]
*  So look, let me set the framing here. Emamoglu had won three tough elections in Istanbul, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  the biggest city in Turkey, and his star is rising significantly. He's in the opposition party, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=112.8s)]
*  and he was about to get nominated for the presidential run from that party. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  And just a couple of days before that, Erdogan all of a sudden finds corruption charges. In fact, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=125.92s)]
*  a lot of them as we'll get to, just totally out of the thin blue air against his main opponent, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=131.04s)]
*  who's massively rising in the polls and will likely knock out Erdogan's party. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  So to say the timing was questionable is a massive understatement. This seems to be Erdogan going, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  no, I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving under any circumstances, and we're not gonna have a fair [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=153.44s)]
*  election. And this is exactly how you snuff out a democracy. And remember, Turkey's the second [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=158.0s)]
*  largest army in NATO. It's supposed to be and often is a bulwark against Russia and against [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=163.6s)]
*  some of our against Iran, against some of our top adversaries in the world and is usually in the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=170.48s)]
*  front line of fighting back. So the fact that it's a democracy is really important, but Erdogan's [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=176.24s)]
*  been trying to defeat that secular democracy from the moment he walked in. He's a post-Ozzyturi, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  the founder of Turkey, which is unprecedented. So he's trying to take Turkey in a Muslim [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=186.4s)]
*  fundamentalist direction. But I have news for him, Saudi Arabia already exists. We don't need a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  second Saudi Arabia. We need a super strong democracy that's an ally for the US and for the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  whole world in that region. So more from Politico. Erdogan's backlash against the opposition comes [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  after CHPs, that's the main opposition parties, unexpectedly convincing victories in cities [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=209.44s)]
*  nationwide and municipal elections in 2024, even in districts that had long been strongholds for [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=214.72s)]
*  the ruling AK party, that's Erdogan's party. On Wednesday, two separate investigations were [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=220.08s)]
*  launched against him and more than 100 others, including politicians, businessmen and journalists. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=225.6s)]
*  The investigations came a day after university authorities cancelled Imamo's diploma and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=230.8s)]
*  necessary requisite for running in the presidential election. Let me pause here one more time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  So guys, this is crossing the Rubicon. Erdogan has already taken so many steps towards autocracy [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  and a dictatorship. He's eliminated a lot of the media, as you're gonna see in a second, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=249.52s)]
*  that were opposed to him. He's fired, arrested and driven out of the country, many of the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  prosecutors and judges that were against them. But we still had some semblance of democracy, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=261.76s)]
*  as the news outlets are going to explain here in a second. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=270.08s)]
*  But when you say that the main opposition leader cannot run against you or cannot run against your [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=272.8s)]
*  party, you're basically saying democracy is over, I'm your dictator now. And again, we'll see how [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  the Turkish people react to that and you're already beginning to see it in five days of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=284.24s)]
*  massive protests. So now at CNBC, they say what is becoming increase, this is Wolf Gano Picoli, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=287.76s)]
*  co-president of Teneo Consultancy and expert on this, saying what is becoming increasingly [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=296.88s)]
*  clear is Erdogan's willingness to steer Turkey toward full autocracy, moving away from the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=301.04s)]
*  competitive authoritarian model that has characterized the country's governance over [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=305.2s)]
*  the past decade. I wanna focus on that because now you're seeing it in Hungary. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=309.04s)]
*  Hungary is in the competitive authoritarian model. That's where Putin and Russia began [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=314.56s)]
*  in the competitive authoritarian model. I'm afraid that the US is inching towards the competitive [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=319.68s)]
*  authoritarian model, which is it's largely authoritarian, but we do kind of have elections, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=325.2s)]
*  right, to full autocracy, full dictatorship. So this is a giant warning to many countries [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=331.52s)]
*  across the world. You saw Putin do it, now you're seeing Erdogan do it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=339.68s)]
*  Okay, so what is Erdogan calling his opponents? You're not going to be at all surprised. This is [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=344.88s)]
*  a movie you've seen here in America, in Israel, and many other places. He says they're doing, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=350.64s)]
*  quote, street terror. Here we go, and then earlier, Interior Ministry Ali Yalekaya accused some [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  protesters of, quote, terrorizing the streets and threatening national security. So how many [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  people have they arrested so far? 1,133 people have been detained during the five days of protests. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  And then Erdogan says, the main opposition is responsible for our injured police officers, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=376.56s)]
*  the broken windows of our shopkeepers, and the damaged public property. They will be held [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  accountable for all this politically in Parliament and legally by the judiciary. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=387.36s)]
*  So again, guys, you see shades of what's happening here. A window was broken. Terrorists, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=391.6s)]
*  some inanimate object was damaged after I declared myself, in essence, a dictator by doing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=398.88s)]
*  an informal coup against my main political opponent. How dare you protest? And then some things [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=409.36s)]
*  were broken along the way. That's it, you're all terrorists. That's it, I'm going to arrest you guys. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=417.12s)]
*  And not because I'm a dictator, but because, hey, what do we have? We had broken windows. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=421.92s)]
*  A shopkeeper's property was damaged. That's their excuse. That's their excuse. The prosecutor's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=429.2s)]
*  office, as Politico explains, also voiced, quote, strong suspicion that Imamullah had been involved [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=436.48s)]
*  in, quote, aiding an armed terrorist organization. Is that true? They've shown absolutely no evidence [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=442.96s)]
*  of that. And it is what everyone is called when you oppose an authoritarian government. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=451.28s)]
*  The word terrorism is super destructive. It's nonsense. It is created by America and Israel, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=456.72s)]
*  ironically, to blame all Muslims and never any Western countries, never any governments. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=463.92s)]
*  But anyone opposed to a government is usually called a terrorist. So now Erdogan has adopted [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  that for his Muslim fundamentalism. Said anyone opposed to Muslim fundamentalism is a terrorist. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=477.04s)]
*  You're for secular democracy, terrorist. My God, you broke a window just because I arrested my [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=482.64s)]
*  political opponent. So don't believe the hype when they use the words like terrorist. It's almost [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=488.8s)]
*  never true. And even if it is true, in some cases, definitely not in this case. But in cases where [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=494.8s)]
*  people have actually harmed or killed civilians, they never say it about a government, whether it's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=501.68s)]
*  the Turkish government, Israeli government or any other government. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=507.76s)]
*  When they kill innocent civilians, when they lock up innocent civilians, they never call [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=510.24s)]
*  themselves terrorists. Let's have the same standard apply to governments as they do to individuals. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=515.12s)]
*  So now let's turn to the point about social media. Because in order for dictators to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=520.32s)]
*  really cement their rule, they have to make sure that voice of dissent are shut out. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=527.44s)]
*  So Politico explains a number of opposition social media accounts [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  were blocked and the bandwidth of social media platforms was restricted. And this is what happens [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=537.76s)]
*  every time they do a crackdown. During the five days of demonstrations pro-government media shied [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=543.04s)]
*  away from reporting on the street protests. So Erdogan has been intimidating the larger media [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=548.16s)]
*  organizations and TV stations in Turkey for as long as he's been in power. And he's been in power [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=553.68s)]
*  for about 20 years. So far, first as prime minister, then as president. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=558.32s)]
*  These calls of him on tape bullying them and saying that they're gonna lose their lives, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=563.2s)]
*  they're gonna lose all their money if they don't report things the way that he wants them reported. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=567.6s)]
*  And that's why all of a sudden they're like, what street protests? Massive street protests [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=574.08s)]
*  all over Turkey, including in Erdogan's hometown, including in areas that were [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=578.0s)]
*  his strongholds. And media that is under the control of Erdogan was like, I don't see it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=585.2s)]
*  I'm not gonna report on it. And so where have I seen people cracking down on media that disagrees [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=590.48s)]
*  with them? Maybe threatening to sue media figures that disagree with them, etc. Yeah, Donald Trump [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=597.2s)]
*  and Elon Musk, which we're gonna get there in a sec. There he is, Elon Musk social media platform [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=603.84s)]
*  X has suspended several accounts belonging to opposition figures in Turkey amid widespread [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=609.12s)]
*  civil unrest in the country. I thought the brother was a free speech absolutist. What happened? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=614.4s)]
*  Remember Twitter files? Can you believe the government asked Twitter to censor some things [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=621.28s)]
*  and Twitter went along? Here, Turkey's like, hey, we're trying to be a dictatorship. Elon, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=626.88s)]
*  can you block those accounts? He's like, absolutely, right away, sir. Of course, sir. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=630.88s)]
*  An authoritarian, yes, of course, I'll block accounts for you. Turkey's interior minister [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=635.52s)]
*  Ali Yerlikaya said on X that authorities have found 326 social media accounts that are quote [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=640.4000000000001s)]
*  unquote inciting hatred. Of course, that's what they say, inciting hatred against them for being [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=646.88s)]
*  dictators. A coordinated action between cyber and security authorities led to the arrest of 54 [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  suspects related to the social media accounts, said Yerlikaya. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=659.04s)]
*  So when social media platforms like X help authoritarian leaders like Erdogan, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=664.24s)]
*  that's Twitter files on steroids. And it's not just shutting down their free speech. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=674.24s)]
*  54 of those people have been arrested. Okay, Musk, though, says he's got an excuse for it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=680.0s)]
*  Look, hear him out. Musk himself said that, quote, the choices have Twitter throttled in its [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=688.24s)]
*  entirety or limit access to some tweets. So I understand that logic, and I'll be fair. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=693.44s)]
*  He say, look, they could shut down all of Twitter or all of X if they wanted to. Yes, I understand [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=700.24s)]
*  that. But at the same time, if they shut down the entire platform, they look way more authoritarian, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=706.08s)]
*  way more dictatorial. Here you say, shut down anyone who's opposed to you. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=713.76s)]
*  Keep the rest of it up so it looks like people agree with you, and then secretly arrest the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=718.72s)]
*  people who disagree with you. I don't know that that's the right calculus. I understand the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=723.12s)]
*  calculus, but I don't agree with it. And then finally on this issue, X heated about 86% [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  of government requests to take down content in the second half of 2024 in Turkey. So there's [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=736.4s)]
*  standing up to the US government, we won't let you do, but the Turkish government, 86% of the time. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=743.6s)]
*  Yeah, anything you want, go ahead. You want their accounts and you want to arrest them? Okay, sure, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=749.04s)]
*  go ahead. So now, meanwhile, last couple things here. How did this work out for Turkey in the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=754.24s)]
*  markets? Disastrously, so things are only gonna get worse. The people are only gonna get angrier. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=760.3199999999999s)]
*  Reuters reports, he also sought to reassure investors who last week [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=766.0s)]
*  sold off Turkish assets following news of Imamoglu's detention, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=769.28s)]
*  sending stocks, bonds, and the lira currency tumbling and prompting the central bank [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=772.64s)]
*  to intervene with foreign exchange sales and other stabilizing measures. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  CNBC reports, a central bank official spent $12 billion in foreign reserves last week. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=780.16s)]
*  The prop of the lira, the Financial Times reported as of March 21st, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  after the currency hit a record low of more than 40 to the dollar. He's absolutely tanking the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  economy, but he doesn't care because it's all about his own power. And again, Piccoli, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=794.48s)]
*  the expert that we quoted earlier said, once again, President Erdogan's political agenda has [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=800.64s)]
*  inflicted serious damage on Turkey's economic outlook. But when you do that, brothers and [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  sisters, it isn't just about the Turkish stock market or Turkish businesses. That's about [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=810.4s)]
*  people being able to afford bread and basic goods. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=814.96s)]
*  And when people cannot afford basic goods because inflation is absolutely through the roof, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=819.36s)]
*  they're gonna get angrier and angrier and justifiably so. And what's interesting is that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=824.72s)]
*  one of his top allies, Abdullah Gil, who was president before him, even he said what was [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=830.16s)]
*  done to President Tayyip Erdogan and to me in the past should not be done to Ekrem Imamoglu either. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=835.04s)]
*  We must not lose the rule of law and justice, otherwise Turkey will lose. And he's basically [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=840.5600000000001s)]
*  saying to Erdogan, hey, remember, we got arrested earlier too. And so don't do the same thing. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, those are very different circumstances. I don't know that should have [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  happened either, by the way. But this is on the route to dictatorship. And even his top allies [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  say, what are you doing? Don't do this. This is gonna end in disaster, and I'm afraid that it will. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=862.16s)]
*  Last positive notice, CHP, the main opposition party, have about normally a million people [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=869.04s)]
*  who vote in their nomination process. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=874.88s)]
*  And Erdogan probably apparently thought that, hey, if I arrest him and I accuse him of corruption [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=879.76s)]
*  and terrorism and all this nonsense, that less people will vote in those and he might not get [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  nominated by the CHP. An unprecedented number of people showed up to vote for him anyway, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=890.64s)]
*  or probably because of this, a couple of days after. That's what I remember, he gets arrested [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=896.8s)]
*  a couple of days before that vote. Erdogan was trying to block him from running. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=901.04s)]
*  And Politico explains the CHP said 15 million people turned out to support [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=905.2s)]
*  Imamoglu in the ballot. The context there is normally again about a million people [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  vote in that party. Now all of a sudden, 15 million people are voting for that party. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=914.64s)]
*  And this is Imamoglu, his quote, he's got a lot of strong quotes, but I'll just read one. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=923.04s)]
*  I stand tall, I will never bow down. So that's spoken like a true Turk. And I'm very curious to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=929.76s)]
*  see what the Turkish people are gonna do, whether they're going to tolerate this or not tolerate [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=938.8s)]
*  this. But we cannot lose that democracy. And you see how it happens, that is a blueprint. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=942.4s)]
*  It's already happened in Russia, it's in the middle of happening in Turkey. We cannot let that [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=948.56s)]
*  come to a conclusion in Turkey, and that's up for the Turkish people to decide, of course. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  And here at home in America, we cannot start taking steps in that direction. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  This is a giant warning sign to everyone across the world. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKP3XPDPCNw&t=962.3199999999999s)]
