"U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said his early departure from the Group of Seven summit was owed to ‚Äúmuch bigger‚Äù things than planning a ceasefire between Tel Aviv and Tehran, after urging people to ‚Äúimmediately evacuate Tehran.‚Äù
The conflict also prompted a joint statement from G7 leaders, affirming support for Israel, while calling for a resolution to the escalating tensions in the Middle East."

# Trump CONFIRMS U.S. In War With Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA)
*  Are you open to negotiating with the Iranians right now or do you wanna wait? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=0.0s)]
*  I've been negotiating, I told them to do the deal, they should have done the deal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=4.4s)]
*  The cities have been blown to pieces and lost a lot of people. They should have done the deal, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=9.52s)]
*  I told them do the deal. So I don't know, I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=14.88s)]
*  As Israel's strikes on Iran continue and with Iran retaliating in self-defense, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=22.88s)]
*  Americans are growing increasingly worried that Donald Trump might drag us into the conflict next. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  And new updates today indicate that is on the table. But before we get to the latest, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=36.0s)]
*  Cenk, how are you feeling about this right now? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=41.68s)]
*  Yeah, so I think the jury's come in. Donald Trump has decided that he is going to drag us into this [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  war. I think the details of this story are really, really important cuz it shows you how he got there [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=49.68s)]
*  and how basically Netanyahu tricked the living crap out of him and how he's such a knucklehead. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=55.52s)]
*  And so he got tricked so easily into this war. And now it looks like America's gonna go in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=64.08s)]
*  not just knee deep but neck deep into this war. So let's explain. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's get into the latest. After four nights of launching missiles at Israel and heavy barrages, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=74.4s)]
*  Iran significantly scaled back its attacks overnight into Tuesday, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=82.72s)]
*  marking the lowest volume since it began retaliating for Israel's airstrikes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=86.88s)]
*  Experts say the change could reflect both Iran's diminished ability to strike back [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=91.52s)]
*  and also a deliberate shift toward lower intensity attacks sustained over a longer period. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=95.84s)]
*  Now G7 leaders, including Trump, signed a joint statement on Monday that, quote, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=102.8s)]
*  affirms Israel has a right to defend itself and, quote, reiterates their support for the security [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=108.72s)]
*  of Israel. In the same statement, they called for de-escalation in the Middle East. But despite [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=115.44s)]
*  signing on to that statement, Trump seems to be taking a different tone. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Axios reported today that US officials said Trump is seriously considering joining the war [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  and launching a US strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, especially its underground uranium [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=131.12s)]
*  enrichment facility in Fordow. Trump has also spent the last few days conducting foreign policy [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=137.84s)]
*  by truth with this coming earlier today. We now have complete and total control over the skies [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=144.8s)]
*  over Iran. Iran has good sky trackers and other defensive equipment and plenty of it, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=151.52s)]
*  but it doesn't compare to American-made, conceived, and manufactured, quote, stuff. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=157.36s)]
*  Nobody does it better than the good old USA, followed by this. We know exactly where the so-called [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=163.76s)]
*  supreme leader is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there. We are not going to take him out, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  parentheses, kill, at least for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians or American [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=178.72s)]
*  soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  But a post yesterday has critics both angry and alarmed. Iran should have signed the, quote, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=190.72s)]
*  deal I told them to sign. What a shame and waste of human life. Simply stated, Iran cannot have a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=197.28s)]
*  nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again. Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=204.56s)]
*  It's worth noting that Trump ripped up President Obama's Iran nuclear deal that did place limits [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=210.72s)]
*  on Iran's uranium enrichment. But more urgently, telling residents of Tehran to evacuate is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=217.36s)]
*  extremely troubling. Tehran's population in the city alone is nearly 10 million people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  And because of the panic that Trump induced, leaving presents a major logistical issue. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=229.52s)]
*  If you expand that area to the metropolitan area, which includes surrounding suburbs and towns, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=234.96s)]
*  its population stands at approximately 14 to 15 million. Heavy traffic congestion is already [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  common in Tehran, especially during rush hour or public holidays. But many of the roads on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=245.52s)]
*  Tuesday were at a standstill with traffic jams throughout the city as residents attempted to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=250.4s)]
*  evacuate. Tehran is also surrounded by mountainous terrain. And exit routes are limited to fewer [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=255.68s)]
*  than a dozen arteries that lead out of the city. Al Jazeera's Dorsa Jabari spoke to some residents [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=262.0s)]
*  who had been attempting to leave Tehran, noting that a trip that usually takes seven to eight [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=268.32s)]
*  hours to reach an area by the Caspian Sea can now take between 18 to 24 hours to complete due [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=273.44s)]
*  to traffic. Now one troubling factor that could lead to direct US involvement is capacity. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=281.04s)]
*  One of Iran's main nuclear facilities, Fordow, is located so deep inside a mountain that it [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=289.28s)]
*  could be effectively bombed only by the United States, which alone has the 30,000-pound bunker [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=294.88s)]
*  buster bomb that could damage the site and the B-2 stealth bomber needed to deliver it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=301.84s)]
*  Now with the US possibly on the brink of a new war with Iran, French President Emmanuel Macron [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  is urging everyone not to make the same mistake they did with Iraq. Does anyone think that what [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=316.08s)]
*  was done in Iraq in 2003 was a good idea, he told reporters in Canada where he was attending a group [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=322.32s)]
*  of seven summit? Does anyone think that what was done in Libya the previous decade was a good idea? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=328.0s)]
*  No, I think the biggest mistake today is to use military means to bring about regime change in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=336.24s)]
*  Iran because that would mean chaos. Cenk, there's a couple things here I think that are worth [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=342.72s)]
*  pointing out. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Trump, who was purportedly the no new wars [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=348.32s)]
*  candidate, seems to be pushing us into a new war. But also, this idea that through military force, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=353.84s)]
*  we are going to lead to regime change and the population there is going to welcome and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=361.52s)]
*  celebrating it, welcome and celebrate it, leading to a stable future seems to clash with history. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=366.4s)]
*  Well, what do you make of this? Yeah, so Trump's a sucker and a willing sucker at that. And he got [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  hoodwinked into this. And I'm gonna explain the details so you know that it wasn't just that he'd [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=381.04s)]
*  always wanted to do it. No, the dum dum got tricked into it. And is it his responsibility? Of course, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  he's the commander in chief president of the United States. It's 100% his responsibility. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=394.32000000000005s)]
*  So I'm gonna come back to that in a second. But first, the things that Jordan shared with you [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=398.72s)]
*  guys. First of all, the G7 leaders, look, they're inching towards criticizing Israel. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  And a couple of hundred years from now, they might gather up the courage to do that after [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=408.96s)]
*  Israel has wiped out the entire Middle East, right? But I mean, this statement where they [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=415.12s)]
*  quote, affirm Israel has a right to defend itself. Is that a joke? Are we supposed to laugh at that? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=420.0s)]
*  Israel started the war. Is that a thing that's allowed? Can we just go and just attack the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=425.92s)]
*  living crap out of Canada? And then if Canada fights back, we got a right to defend ourselves [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=431.44s)]
*  here. Let's obliterate Canada more. That's literally what Israel does. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=437.12s)]
*  And so enabling them is not helping. Look, American government's nearly hopeless except for [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=442.16s)]
*  the fight back that we're gonna tell you about throughout the show from the actual grassroots, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=449.52s)]
*  the population rising up now, cuz they've lost everyone, everyone. No one in America wants this [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=453.2s)]
*  war, and I'll prove that to you with the numbers in a second. But the European leaders, what are [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=459.12s)]
*  you guys doing? Why are you serving Israel loyally? What is wrong with you guys? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=462.64s)]
*  So gather up some courage to oppose Israel, constantly attacking their neighbors and starting [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=468.0s)]
*  wars. All right, so now, are we involved? Well, Trump says we have control over their skies. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  He said we, right? Then he talked about American weapons doing all the damage, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  bragging about it. American intelligence involved, American weapons involved, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=486.4s)]
*  not just on defense, but on offense. That is critical, absolutely critical. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=489.52s)]
*  Then third way that we're involved, he says, yeah, by the way, we can murder your leader at [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=495.68s)]
*  any time, and we might later. If we decide that we're gonna kill you, we reserve the right to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=499.2s)]
*  kill you. By the way, of course, if they killed our leaders, whether it's US or Israel, we would say, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=504.79999999999995s)]
*  terrorist, the worst terrorist in the world. But Israel's above the law, so Israel can kill any [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=509.76s)]
*  foreign leader they like. They can also kill any US citizen they like. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=517.44s)]
*  And you're not allowed to complain about it at all, otherwise, anti-Semite. So now, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=520.6400000000001s)]
*  there are three options involved in how the next phase of the attack happens. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  So option number one is Israel does it on their own. It turns out, guys, this is so sad, but it's [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=532.8800000000001s)]
*  a report from the New York Times, okay, with a lot of internal sources. So Trump, all the way through, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=538.1600000000001s)]
*  was hesitant about attacking. He did stop an attack in April from Israel. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=544.16s)]
*  Netanyahu's jonesing to attack Iran. Now, why now? We're gonna show you how he's been trying [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=549.84s)]
*  to get us to attack Iran for 33 straight years now. He's been lying for 33 straight years, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=555.44s)]
*  conclusive proof of that in a minute. So why now? Because they wiped out the Syrian forces, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=560.48s)]
*  why did Assad fall as Israel did that? This whole idea of some rando Al Qaeda dude just came out of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  nowhere and did it? No, Israel wiped out their air force and took a portion of Western Syria and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=575.0400000000001s)]
*  cleared out the airspace. They cleared out Hezbollah, they cleared out Hamas, so they're not [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=580.96s)]
*  worried about Iranian proxies anymore. This is when Iran is most defenseless and has the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=585.52s)]
*  least ability to strike Israel. So Netanyahu told the US intelligence and Trump, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  sometime in the last two months, listen, I don't really care about you. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=597.5999999999999s)]
*  You're gonna keep sending me money cuz you're a sucker and I own you, okay? So you don't have [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=601.8399999999999s)]
*  any right to do anything about what I'm doing, okay? But I'm going to go attack Iran, whether [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=608.64s)]
*  you like it or not. Do you understand me? And Trump was like, okay, okay. So then they started [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=614.56s)]
*  changing the game planning, the war planning inside the White House to, okay, Israel's [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=619.28s)]
*  definitely going to attack. Now there, if Trump was a man, what he would have done is, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=624.24s)]
*  what'd you say? Did you just boss me around and tell me that you're gonna do that attack, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=628.72s)]
*  even though I told you not to? Which he very clearly said in April not to. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=633.36s)]
*  Trump told Netanyahu that. Netanyahu comes back in a couple of weeks cuz, yeah, I'm gonna do it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=637.44s)]
*  What are you gonna do about it, huh? And Trump goes, nothing, nothing, I'm just sorry. So not a man, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=641.6s)]
*  okay, not a leader, and certainly not anti-war. So then they start planning around, okay, what do we [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=647.44s)]
*  do? And that's when they just presented the three options I mentioned earlier. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=653.84s)]
*  So option number one is Israel does it on their own, but now it looks like we are past that option. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=657.52s)]
*  And all the things that Jordan read you means that we are gonna do either option two or option three. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=664.72s)]
*  Because option one was, hey, good luck. I mean, we'll obviously help in defense, although I don't [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  think that should be obvious at all. But we'll knock down all their missiles, we'll get as [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=676.08s)]
*  involved as you want us to be, but we're not going on the offense, okay? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=680.24s)]
*  So we're past that, it looks like by all indications, New York Times reporting and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=683.6s)]
*  everything that Donald Trump has said publicly, we are going to go on the offense. We are going [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=687.52s)]
*  to start a war with Iran as the United States of America. And it's Israel's war, it has nothing to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=692.32s)]
*  do with us, nothing, nothing. They don't have nukes, it's all a lie, has absolutely nothing to do with [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=700.88s)]
*  America. But we're going to be forced to pay for this war. We're already paying a ton of money, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=707.04s)]
*  like the press never reports that all those missiles cost money. You're going on the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=712.16s)]
*  offense is gonna cost a lot more money. And God help us if we gotta go on the ground. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  Okay, but the third option is, hey, America, you do it on your own, okay? We started it, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  we're not gonna fight it. We're not gonna risk precious Israeli lives. Why don't you use your [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=726.8s)]
*  worthless American soldiers to go die for us, okay? And if you think, that's not a strategy. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=733.84s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, one of the leading neo-cons who pushed for the Iraq war, some of the fake [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=740.64s)]
*  intelligence about the WMD was from Israel. And at the time, Israeli leaders said Iraq was [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=746.1600000000001s)]
*  their number one enemy. Now they say Iran is their number one enemy. So we have to do that work for [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=752.0s)]
*  them. But not only that, Trump already lived this with the Kusum Soleimani killing in his first term, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=756.32s)]
*  the top military leader for Iran when they bombed him. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=762.4s)]
*  Israel said that they were gonna do it together with us. And at the last second, Netanyahu pulled [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  out and made America do it by itself. So it would have the full responsibility. And if a war started, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=769.36s)]
*  America would be forced to fight it, not Israel. That's who Netanyahu is. So there is some chance [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=776.0799999999999s)]
*  that we're gonna go in together. And at some point, Israel's gonna go, not my war. Now you go fight it [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  for me. Look at these bought corrupt politicians in America. So easy to buy. You just get eight [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=788.32s)]
*  back and give them a couple hundred million dollars. And then we get a couple hundred billion [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=794.4000000000001s)]
*  dollars back. The Iraq war cost trillions, bunch of suckers in America for Israel to abuse. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=798.0s)]
*  If you think, hey, wait, Cenk, come on. Now that sounds like it's hyperbole. I mean, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=804.4000000000001s)]
*  has Netanyahu and Israel really been lying to us this whole time? I mean, I hear on mainstream [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=808.88s)]
*  media that they are the beloved special ally. And that we should trust them more than anyone else [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=813.36s)]
*  than the rest of the Middle East combined, than the rest of the world combined. They are the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=819.12s)]
*  special ally. They cannot be questioned. And if you do, anti-Semite. Okay, so prepare for [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=822.96s)]
*  the entire country to become apparently anti-Semites by mainstream media and Washington's [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  definition. Because you're all about to find out how much of a liar Benjamin Netanyahu and [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=835.2s)]
*  the government of Israel is. So this is a clip, by the way, put together. Anybody could have done [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=840.24s)]
*  this as usual, embarrassing that ABC News, CNN, etc. Not only doesn't do this, but kind of hides [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=844.24s)]
*  it from you. It took The Daily Show to put together this clip. Now let's watch. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=851.04s)]
*  If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  it could be within a few months. They have the wherewithal, the stored up, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=861.92s)]
*  preserved knowledge to make a bomb very quickly if they wanted to do it. Iran is so dangerous, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=867.68s)]
*  weeks away from having the fissile material for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=873.76s)]
*  They're very close. They're six months away from being about 90% of having the rich uranium for [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=880.4799999999999s)]
*  an atom bomb. Iran is gearing up to have to produce 25 bombs, atomic bombs a year, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=885.12s)]
*  250 bombs in a decade. Ladies and gentlemen, time is running out. Iran will be capable [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=891.2s)]
*  of producing alone without importing anything, nuclear bombs within three to five years. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=898.16s)]
*  That was Benjamin Netanyahu for those of you on the audio podcast throughout all the years dating [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=902.96s)]
*  back to 1995. For 33 straight years, Benjamin Netanyahu and the government of Israel has been [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=909.6s)]
*  lying to America to get us to go into a war with Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=917.52s)]
*  And what they have told us, there's weeks away, they're so close. They're on the verge, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=924.56s)]
*  he said in that 1996 clip. They were on the verge in 1996. Our intelligence, and this is now [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=930.24s)]
*  absolutely public, because Solcy Gabbard said it in congressional hearings, say that Iran does not [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=938.24s)]
*  even have a uranium weapons program. It hasn't had one since 2003. The Grand Iotola has [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=944.0s)]
*  forbidden it and even done a religious edict saying that it is immoral to develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  And our intelligence has confirmed that they do not have a bomb. They're nowhere near having a bomb. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=958.16s)]
*  All of this has always been lies. And wait, what was the lie about Iraq that got us to go in? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=964.88s)]
*  Not that they did 9-11 because they actually didn't do 9-11. Saddam Hussein, as terrible as [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=970.24s)]
*  he was, was against Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was trying to topple his government as well. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  So not 9-11, that was a convenient excuse. It was WMD, weapons of mass destruction. Wait, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=978.88s)]
*  what's a nuclear weapon? All right, a weapon of mass destruction. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=985.6s)]
*  Another giant lie about WMD, and now we're getting dragged into another war. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=990.16s)]
*  So finally come back all the way around to Trump. So Israel goes, hey, listen, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=997.36s)]
*  you're not the boss of us. We're the boss of you. We're gonna go start this war in Iran, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1001.84s)]
*  and then you're gonna have to go use one of your three options where you come in and we do this. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1005.76s)]
*  Okay, so they start doing it. And then Trump, the reason they put out the statement with Marco [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1011.04s)]
*  Rubio on the first night saying, hey, this is Israel doing it, not us, is because Trump wanted [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1015.36s)]
*  to see how it went. And then on Fox News, this is why Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, and others are [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1020.64s)]
*  now in a war with Fox News. Fox News, because they know Trump is watching, puts out video reports of [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1027.52s)]
*  Israel with a genius strike inside Iran. How strong, how wonderful of Israel. They have done [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1035.28s)]
*  a brilliant job here. So then Trump watches that and it's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1041.92s)]
*  I want the credit to go to me. So he rushes out and goes, I knew it, I knew they were gonna do it. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1046.56s)]
*  We're involved. Jesus Christ, you're so easy and predictable and dumb. So we're involved. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1051.6799999999998s)]
*  So now the next and last layer is, now Israel is telling Trump, again, this is New York Times [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1062.56s)]
*  reporting and the reporting and mainstream media from sources inside the White House. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1068.48s)]
*  They're telling him, this is gonna be easy. Do you know that they said, the Neocon said [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1073.12s)]
*  that the Iraq war would only cost 1.9 billion? Instead, it literally cost at least [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1079.6799999999998s)]
*  1,000 times that. It cost over $2 trillion. And now they're telling Trump the same exact lie. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1086.96s)]
*  Donnie, this is gonna be so easy. No, no, we just bombed their nuclear, I mean, we don't do it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1095.2s)]
*  We can't do it. We don't have the capability to do it. So then why did you start the war? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1101.04s)]
*  We knew that if we start the war, even though we can't accomplish our mission of knocking out their [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1105.44s)]
*  non-existent nukes, America will do it for us. And so now the moron Donald Trump thinks, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1110.56s)]
*  oh yeah, I'm gonna be strong like Israel. Yeah, I'll fight this war for that. I'll knock out their [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1119.28s)]
*  nukes. So they're planning and again, they don't have that. They have nuclear facilities for energy. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1124.3999999999999s)]
*  And it's been confirmed by the world that it is for energy. Now, are they trying to enrich the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1129.68s)]
*  uranium past that? Because they started to worry that Israel is gonna attack them unless they have [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1134.0s)]
*  nukes? I don't know. I know that they're enriching uranium a little bit more now, but they don't even [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1138.24s)]
*  have a weapon to put it on. And it would take over a year for them to produce that weapon. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  Not according to me, according to Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend. He said that. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1147.6000000000001s)]
*  They're still, even by Netanyahu's standards, well over a year away from having that be a weapon. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1151.6000000000001s)]
*  So there is no weapon to bomb there, okay? There are facilities. So we're gonna go and do that, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1157.6s)]
*  apparently. That's apparently imminent. By the way, when we do that, our troops are sitting ducks [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1164.32s)]
*  all across the Middle East. They don't have Iron Dome. They're just waiting there to get killed on [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1170.1599999999999s)]
*  behalf of Israel so that Donald Trump and the neocons can come out and go, that's it. Iran attacked [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1174.9599999999998s)]
*  America, war, war, war, war, war. And Jordan, the last part of it is, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1180.4s)]
*  boom, they move the goalposts. And you'll see this all over the media now. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1187.44s)]
*  We tell you ahead of time now, you're gonna notice it if you make the mistake of turning on cable news [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1191.44s)]
*  or engaging in mainstream media in other ways. Now it's no longer knocking out their non-existent [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1196.8000000000002s)]
*  nukes, it's a regime change. Well, how are you gonna do a regime change? Well, we're gonna kill [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1202.8000000000002s)]
*  the Ayatollah, but that's not gonna do it. They'll just replace him with another mullah, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1208.64s)]
*  and then another one and another one. You gotta go on the ground. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1211.5200000000002s)]
*  Okay, and this is how America gets suckered into another war for Israel. Jordan? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1217.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. I wanna point out the intelligence that the US [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1224.5600000000002s)]
*  had and was shared and reporters learned of earlier this year showed they were around three years [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1231.1200000000001s)]
*  away from enriching uranium to weapons grade, which would allow them to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1238.6399999999999s)]
*  But the intelligence also found that isn't even actively what they're doing. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1246.72s)]
*  They are just using uranium and enriching uranium for medical devices, for necessities, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1252.32s)]
*  for infrastructure. And I wanna remind people that they have been subject to crippling sanctions, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1259.76s)]
*  which worsened their healthcare system, especially during the pandemic. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1264.96s)]
*  So that's why in part why they were enriching uranium on top of all of the other totally [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1269.52s)]
*  diplomatic reasons that every other country would like energy. So this idea that we have to take [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1275.8400000000001s)]
*  out their program and that in doing so we will topple their government and everyone in Iran will [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1280.48s)]
*  cheer and be happy is ludicrous. You can see from history time and time again, US intervention and [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1285.04s)]
*  regime change has created a vacuum in those countries or in those regions that allow even [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1290.8799999999999s)]
*  worse actors to come in, establish shop and make life a living hell. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1296.48s)]
*  And then the US uses that as justification for permanent occupation. At what cost? How many [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1301.6s)]
*  people need to lose their lives? How many people need to be harmed? How many billions and billions [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1306.96s)]
*  or trillions of dollars do we need to waste on these types of just wasteful efforts? These kind [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1311.44s)]
*  of Don Quixote escapades. Meanwhile, people here are suffering. You ask anybody in middle America [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1318.72s)]
*  who can't afford to make ends meet, who's struggling to afford groceries, who's struggling [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1325.3600000000001s)]
*  to pay for their medical bills or can't afford their car payment or even struggling to keep a [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1329.68s)]
*  roof over their head. Do you think they care right now about Iran? Do you think they care [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1335.04s)]
*  about who's in charge? Do you think they care about Iran's nuclear capabilities? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1338.88s)]
*  And if you had to ask them, what would you rather your tax dollars go to? Paying for essential [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1342.88s)]
*  services for you like SNAP and Medicaid, which are currently on the chopping block because of [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1347.84s)]
*  a reported debt and spending crisis according to Republicans. Or do you want it to go to Israel? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1353.6s)]
*  Or do you want to go to our military so they can bomb a mountain in Iran? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1358.48s)]
*  I'd say probably 90% if not more would say no, I'd rather my issues get taken care of. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1363.36s)]
*  So not only is this ridiculous, not only is this harmful and dangerous for people living in Iran, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1369.6799999999998s)]
*  you're neglecting the people that got you into office. And I know we've got more later in the [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1374.88s)]
*  hour of his base turning on him. But that is an important point to drive home. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1378.5600000000002s)]
*  Nobody wants this. Polling shows this is deeply, deeply unpopular. Regardless of political [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1383.7600000000002s)]
*  persuasion across the country, people do not want this. Only the hawks, only the military industrial [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1389.2s)]
*  complex and potentially now Trump. Yeah, so last couple things here. Yesterday we covered Tim [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1395.7600000000002s)]
*  Dillon talking about what Jordan was mentioning there. He's like, if you knocked on a trailer [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1402.88s)]
*  door in Arizona or something and you ask that brother, hey, what's your top three concerns? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1410.72s)]
*  Do you think Iran would be on that list? It's a joke, right? I mean, I said if you put [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1415.7600000000002s)]
*  top 20 Iran wouldn't be on that list. No, this only the people in Washington, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1420.8000000000002s)]
*  the elites, the powerful want this. In fact, I have a poll that absolutely positively proves that. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1425.1200000000001s)]
*  Poll came out today. Only 16% of Americans want America to get involved in the war with Iran. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1430.16s)]
*  16%. 16% is such a small number. That's like super radicals. The rest of the country looks at them [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1437.12s)]
*  like you're crazy, you're nuts. Overwhelming majority of the country does not want the US [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1445.2s)]
*  involved in this war. But almost everyone in Washington does. And they're basically giving [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1451.84s)]
*  a giant middle finger to the rest of us and going, you're on the left, you've always been anti-war. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1457.44s)]
*  We never listened to you guys anyway, right? You're on the right and you actually became [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1463.76s)]
*  anti-war and you voted for Trump because you thought he was anti-war. Suckers, we did the [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1468.24s)]
*  same thing with the Democrats. Yeah, Biden's anti-war. Did he vote for the Iraq war? Of course [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1474.3200000000002s)]
*  he did. Hillary's anti-war. Did she vote for the Iraq war? John Kerry, did he vote for the Iraq war? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1479.04s)]
*  They all voted for the Iraq war, you suckers. And who started that? The Republicans did. So you go [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1483.6s)]
*  to Republicans? Nope, we're gonna start the wars. Democrats, we're gonna bow our heads and go along [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1488.56s)]
*  with the wars. And who's back? Trump. He's different. He's not a unit party. He's not [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1493.52s)]
*  establishment. He's like, baby, how can I help you? How can I start a war? So no, the same old unit [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1497.28s)]
*  party, the same old establishment. And the elites are laughing at us. They're gonna look at this. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1503.76s)]
*  84% of the country doesn't want it, but we're gonna make them do it anyway. And those other 16% watch [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1509.12s)]
*  cable news, we brainwash the living crap out of them. And they think this helps America. Hilarious. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1515.6s)]
*  Okay, what's not gonna be funny is when we fight back. So we're gonna start that tonight. The show's [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1521.76s)]
*  live 68 PM Eastern. We'll give you the news. And then at eight, oftentimes we do interviews. So [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1527.04s)]
*  tonight we'll be doing an interview with Dave Smith, one of the leading libertarians in the country. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1530.8s)]
*  And I'm gonna propose to you guys a way that you could fight back and you could throw all [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1534.3999999999999s)]
*  these bombs out. And I think it's realistic. I think it can be done. Will it be done enough [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1538.6399999999999s)]
*  time to stop this initial bombing? No way. No chance of that. But later in the show, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1544.6399999999999s)]
*  we're gonna show you that there are a couple of heroes inside Congress that are trying to [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1550.48s)]
*  stop this war. And there is a way you can help them. And we could actually, at the very, very [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1554.56s)]
*  minimum, try really hard to stop this war. And if we can't stop it, well, there should be deep [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1560.0s)]
*  political consequences. So I'm calling that Operation Consequences. You'll see that tonight [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1568.16s)]
*  at eight o'clock Eastern. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1573.44s)]
*  Totally not true. But it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWmuOeqAVQA&t=1577.6s)]
