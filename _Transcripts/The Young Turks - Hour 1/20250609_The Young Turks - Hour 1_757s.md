TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Tim Dillon EXPOSES HUGE Palantir Secret
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c)
*  is the administration that got [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=0.0s)]
*  elected to purge the deep state, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  actually using the deep state to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=5.84s)]
*  compile a list of data on all [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=8.84s)]
*  the people that live here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=11.58s)]
*  This shadowy company Palantir that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=15.14s)]
*  works with the CIA, the military, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  if you don't have any reservations [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=18.92s)]
*  about Palantir taking everyone's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=20.78s)]
*  information, I don't know, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=22.66s)]
*  I can't, I don't know if I can [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=24.54s)]
*  trust you, I think you're [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=26.36s)]
*  buying people left and right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=28.16s)]
*  This is my guess, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=31.64s)]
*  they try to buy me, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=32.72s)]
*  my **** costs a lot of money. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=34.12s)]
*  Comedian Tim Dillon alleged that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=36.4s)]
*  Palantir, the data analysis firm [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=39.44s)]
*  with ties to Elon Musk and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=42.4s)]
*  tech mogul Peter Thiel is [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  essentially trying to buy public [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  figures to give them positive [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=49.74s)]
*  press to make them [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=52.24s)]
*  pro Palantir propagandists. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  And you want to know something, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=56.72s)]
*  I give Tim Dillon so much credit [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=58.12s)]
*  for disclosing that to the public. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  I also give him credit for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  calling it like he sees it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=63.76s)]
*  He's been pretty good on his [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=65.24s)]
*  commentary in regard to what's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=66.89999999999999s)]
*  going down in Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=68.8s)]
*  He's been critical of the Trump [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=70.16s)]
*  administration when they deserve [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=71.64s)]
*  it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=73.24s)]
*  I don't agree with him on [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=73.74s)]
*  everything, but his podcast is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=75.28s)]
*  among my favorites these days. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=77.2s)]
*  Anyway, before I give you more, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Waz, just want to get some initial [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=80.88s)]
*  thoughts from you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=82.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there are [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=84.44s)]
*  issues with the rise of new media [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=87.2s)]
*  with even guys that you would [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=90.16s)]
*  consider conservative influencers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=92.68s)]
*  However, they are definitely more [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=96.08s)]
*  independent than say, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=99.48s)]
*  Sean Hannity. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=101.88s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=103.76s)]
*  Or Bill O'Reilly back in the days [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=104.76s)]
*  or anybody that you would get on [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=107.44s)]
*  Fox or even like hate radio. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=110.28s)]
*  Those guys just would just never go [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=113.64s)]
*  against a Trump administration, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  a Republican administration as [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  readily and as willingly as these [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=122.05999999999999s)]
*  right wing influencer comedian [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  types are willing to do. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  Say what you want when a big person [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=129.76s)]
*  comes on the platform and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=132.0s)]
*  they kind of softball the questions. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=133.68s)]
*  That being said, man, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=136.44s)]
*  these people are more willing to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=137.48s)]
*  say what they think than most other [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  right wing commentators. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think your analysis is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=142.28s)]
*  spot on, right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=144.12s)]
*  And look, I'll give you another [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=145.24s)]
*  example of some areas in which some [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  of these podcasters do fall short [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=149.84s)]
*  because they're not political [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  analysts. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=154.36s)]
*  So they're not necessarily equipped [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  with the information to debate [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  someone who's on their show [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=160.56s)]
*  spreading lies or trying to, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=162.8s)]
*  like in the case of JD Vance who was [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  recently on Theo Vonn's podcast. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=167.84s)]
*  Look, Theo Vonn isn't some expert [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=170.88s)]
*  on what's happening in Gaza, but [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=173.12s)]
*  he's a human being who has seen [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=175.2s)]
*  the atrocities committed by the IDF [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=177.2s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip and felt the need [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=179.64s)]
*  to speak out about it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=182.0s)]
*  He says this looks like a genocide. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=183.68s)]
*  He had JD Vance on recently and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=186.96s)]
*  brought up this issue and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=188.84s)]
*  JD Vance tried to placate him. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=190.26s)]
*  I don't know if it worked, but [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=192.24s)]
*  I noticed that Theo Vonn didn't [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  have the tools in his toolbox to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=196.6s)]
*  refute what JD Vance was saying. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  But nonetheless, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=202.48s)]
*  his heart is in the right place. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  So I give him a lot of credit. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  The fact that he's saying what he [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  actually thinks without concern [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=207.2s)]
*  about placating or [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=209.16s)]
*  appeasing a political party or [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  political side, I think is more [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=212.16s)]
*  valuable than having the Sean [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=214.11999999999998s)]
*  Hannity's who always run cover for [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=216.0s)]
*  Donald Trump or whatever the right [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=218.16s)]
*  wing is up to. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=220.48s)]
*  Okay, so what was Dylan talking [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  about there? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, he was responding to a story [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=224.2s)]
*  that we actually covered last week [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  about how Donald Trump's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=228.4s)]
*  administration is essentially [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  tapping Palantir to compile [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=231.84s)]
*  Americans personal information into [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  this database. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=236.12s)]
*  And by the way, right now with [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=237.28s)]
*  the riots that are taking place in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=239.4s)]
*  Los Angeles, it's totally playing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=241.84s)]
*  into Donald Trump's hand because [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=244.4s)]
*  that type of civil unrest is [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=246.68s)]
*  exactly what the Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  administration will point to as [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=250.32s)]
*  a justification for increased [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=252.72s)]
*  surveillance of American citizens. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=255.0s)]
*  So just be aware of that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=257.76s)]
*  Let me give you more. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=259.92s)]
*  So the plan is a result of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=260.76s)]
*  an executive order that Trump had [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=262.32s)]
*  signed back in March calling for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=264.48s)]
*  the federal government to share [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=266.52s)]
*  data across agencies, which [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  naturally has raised some concerns [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=270.44s)]
*  about the federal government's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  surveillance power. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=274.48s)]
*  Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=275.8s)]
*  denies that the program has [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=277.96s)]
*  anything to do with surveillance, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=279.88s)]
*  even though surveillance is part of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=282.28s)]
*  what Palantir does. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=284.76s)]
*  But even some in the MAGA camp are [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=286.76s)]
*  not buying it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  In fact, I've seen some of them be [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=289.96s)]
*  very vocal against this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=292.0s)]
*  They're furious with Trump and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=293.84s)]
*  the fact that he's carrying out [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  this plan that seems to go against [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  everything he claimed to be before. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=299.79999999999995s)]
*  And now Tim Dillon is giving us [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=302.08s)]
*  a little more insight into the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=304.4s)]
*  manipulative behavior Palantir and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=306.67999999999995s)]
*  tech companies like Palantir who [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=309.55999999999995s)]
*  try to get people with platforms [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=312.23999999999995s)]
*  to cover them in a more favorable [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=314.92s)]
*  light. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=317.08s)]
*  So without further ado, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=317.64s)]
*  let's watch what Tim Dillon has to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=318.84s)]
*  say about that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=320.6s)]
*  I get invited to these dinners, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=321.32s)]
*  I don't go. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=323.12s)]
*  I've been invited to Teals House [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  multiple times for dinner, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=325.92s)]
*  I don't go. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=327.76s)]
*  It's no shade at them or whatever. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=328.48s)]
*  The reason I don't go is I remember [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=331.48s)]
*  one dinner like we'd like to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=334.28s)]
*  discuss the media. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=336.48s)]
*  I go, why? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=338.36s)]
*  I go, I don't want to go. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=339.24s)]
*  I don't want to go. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=340.84s)]
*  I don't want to go. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=341.88s)]
*  I go, what? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=343.96s)]
*  No thanks. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=345.44s)]
*  Here's what I'm doing every week. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=348.96s)]
*  I'm discussing the media. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=350.16s)]
*  Hey, good news, I have a show. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=351.28s)]
*  I have a show, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=353.64s)]
*  you can listen to it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=354.56s)]
*  You can listen to it if you're [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=356.48s)]
*  curious about but [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=358.16s)]
*  I've been to some of these places. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=359.12s)]
*  I've sat in these houses in Austin [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=360.96s)]
*  with these tech people. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=363.36s)]
*  And I know what they want. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=365.44s)]
*  And I know what they want me to go [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=367.64s)]
*  out and cheerlead for and say, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=369.44s)]
*  well, it's actually a great idea. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=371.04s)]
*  There's probably a lot of money in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=372.32s)]
*  it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=373.64s)]
*  There's probably a lot of money. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  And I just can't do it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=378.32s)]
*  I love the fact that he disclosed [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=380.96s)]
*  this and big shout out to Tim [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=383.24s)]
*  Dillon for being unwilling to be [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=385.24s)]
*  bought by any moneyed interests. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=387.76s)]
*  In this case, it would be seems [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=390.28s)]
*  like he's making clear that it's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  palantir. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=394.12s)]
*  But I just want to go to one more [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  video before I go to you was [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=396.76s)]
*  because look, the good news is that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  he agrees mainstream media is close [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  to dead, but there is bad news. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  And that bad news is that you're [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=405.76s)]
*  about to see independent media get [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  bought just based on his personal [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  experience and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  what you're about to hear him say. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=412.55999999999995s)]
*  This is the new way it used to be [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  the news media but [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=416.08s)]
*  I've been doing interviews with [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=417.08s)]
*  the news media. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=418.88s)]
*  They're. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=419.84s)]
*  It doesn't even work. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=420.35999999999996s)]
*  Who the left in the news media? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=424.23999999999995s)]
*  These people are broke. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=426.08s)]
*  Anyone with a half a degree of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=427.79999999999995s)]
*  talent is on YouTube. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=429.92s)]
*  I mean, these people are beyond [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=431.48s)]
*  no one's even buying them anymore. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=432.92s)]
*  They're going to start buying up [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=435.08s)]
*  podcasters and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=436.92s)]
*  youtubers and whatever. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=437.9s)]
*  I think that's totally true and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=440.04s)]
*  I'm sure that had already started [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=441.84s)]
*  years prior to Tim Dillon drawing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=443.92s)]
*  attention to it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=445.8s)]
*  I could name some names but [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=447.2s)]
*  I'll toss over to you was. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=448.76s)]
*  Bro, you think the Israelis [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=451.0s)]
*  haven't already started on many of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=453.28s)]
*  our least favorite right wing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=456.08s)]
*  podcasters. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=458.76s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  That's already happening. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=460.88s)]
*  I'm sure the Saudis have a program. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=465.48s)]
*  I'm sure it's not like [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=467.92s)]
*  the Israelis are alone. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=469.64s)]
*  I'm sure the Emiratis and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  Qataris I'm sure they all of these [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=473.0s)]
*  countries that want to curry favor [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=476.0s)]
*  amongst the population in America [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  are going to put their hats in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=481.6s)]
*  the ring. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's kind of why it's like [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=485.12s)]
*  Independent media is not going to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  save us, right? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=489.4s)]
*  Whereas with mainstream media where [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=490.67999999999995s)]
*  they're so beholden to their [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=493.2s)]
*  sponsors like the pharmaceutical [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=495.2s)]
*  companies and all these other [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=497.84s)]
*  moneyed interests that pay the bills [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=500.11999999999995s)]
*  via buying commercials with these [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=502.91999999999996s)]
*  news platforms. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  Independent media is no different. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  These guys are advertising based [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=509.76s)]
*  revenues, right? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=512.36s)]
*  And so if you are wholly dependent [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=514.16s)]
*  on your advertisement in order to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=516.64s)]
*  survive, yeah man, some people [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=519.2s)]
*  won't come along and be like, look, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  we could up your ad money, but [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=524.52s)]
*  you got to tow the company line. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=526.88s)]
*  It's no different. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=529.48s)]
*  And there will be some independent [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=530.32s)]

*  their business and what they can do [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=649.8000000000001s)]

*  end of story. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=656.52s)]
*  They don't care about [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=657.36s)]
*  the Democratic Party, they don't [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=658.24s)]
*  care about the Republican Party [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=659.72s)]
*  they're trying to maneuver in a way [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=661.24s)]
*  in which they can use the political [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=662.92s)]

*  And so far, and this isn't new, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=666.12s)]
*  this has been going on for decades, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=667.88s)]
*  it worked, it's working on their [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=669.88s)]
*  behalf. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=671.84s)]
*  And it's important for Americans [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=672.36s)]
*  across the political spectrum to be [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=674.48s)]
*  aware of that. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=676.64s)]
*  Because when you have tech [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=677.92s)]
*  companies essentially plotting to [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=679.92s)]

*  contracts to do mass surveillance [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=685.04s)]
*  on American citizens, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  that's a problem and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=689.48s)]
*  that shouldn't be a partisan issue. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=690.48s)]
*  So if there is common ground among [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=692.48s)]
*  Trump voters and us on the left in [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=694.7600000000001s)]

*  against the surveillance that will [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=699.1600000000001s)]
*  be done by Palantir on American [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=701.5200000000001s)]
*  citizens, we should work together [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=703.48s)]
*  and push back against it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=705.6s)]
*  And look, again, I say this all [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=707.24s)]
*  the time on the show, people hate [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=708.84s)]

*  There are areas where there is [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=712.12s)]
*  agreement, and if we keep allowing [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=713.8800000000001s)]
*  the elite, if we keep allowing [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=716.2s)]
*  those in positions of power to [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=718.28s)]
*  divide and conquer us, well, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=720.32s)]
*  our quality of life will continue [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=722.52s)]
*  being diminished, and I'm sick of [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=724.92s)]
*  that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=727.36s)]
*  I just want to win on something to [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=728.52s)]
*  make life better for all of us. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=731.12s)]
*  So if we can work together in some [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=733.92s)]
*  of these narrow areas, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=736.04s)]
*  we should work together. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=737.64s)]
*  We'll see if that happens, but [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=739.8s)]
*  for now, it looks like Palantir is [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=741.64s)]
*  poised to do mass surveillance on [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=743.64s)]
*  American citizens at the behest of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-z1AKOjW4c&t=745.5600000000001s)]
