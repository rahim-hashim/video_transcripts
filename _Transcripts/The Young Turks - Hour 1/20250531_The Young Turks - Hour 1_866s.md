Keeping an eye out for red flags when dating is one thing ‚Äî but now some daters of the digital age are sparing themselves from a future heartbreak by cutting off potential suitors early on for what some might consider to be very minor things."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# The WILD 'Cut Them Off' Dating Strategy That's Going Viral
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ)
*  I don't think there's any reason too small to cut off a romantic interest, man or woman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Last year I was seeing someone that I really liked and I cut him off because he didn't wish [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=4.16s)]
*  me a safe flight. I believe that especially in the early stages of dating, if you get any kind of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=7.84s)]
*  inkling that your needs are not being met, it's fine to move on. In fact, it should be welcomed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=12.16s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=21.04s)]
*  My God, that was insane. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=22.32s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=24.64s)]
*  Was insane. Girl, if you wanna be single for the rest of your life, just say it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=25.76s)]
*  Just say it, okay? Because that's what's gonna happen. So there's yet another new dating trend [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  making its rounds on social media. I think social media needs to be abolished. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=36.56s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. So this time people are breaking things off with their partner for literally [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=40.64s)]
*  the smallest nonsensical reasons. And you just got a sense of what I'm talking about here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  So the cut them off theory is a new trend circulating on social media where people [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=53.92s)]
*  are breaking things off with their lover. If that person cannot meet their small needs, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=59.52s)]
*  their thought process is that if they are this way early on, things will only get worse down the line. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=66.48s)]
*  Let me just say when me and my husband, who I do love deeply, okay, first started dating, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=74.48s)]
*  he committed many offenses. Let's just put, and they were not small offenses. They were big offenses. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=81.44s)]
*  Big offenses. All right. I'm not gonna get- [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=87.12s)]
*  Can we not? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=90.4s)]
*  I'm not gonna get specific, but I don't know. I just didn't give up on him because [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  I knew that he didn't know what he had. He just needed to learn and he did. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  So you're welcome, Christian. Anyway, no, but serious. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=107.52s)]
*  You never know. The example the woman gave in the video we just showed, okay, maybe he got caught [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=113.12s)]
*  up in a work meeting or something and it just, he didn't get a chance. Who cares? Who cares? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=119.04s)]
*  Who cares if he didn't wish it was a flight? Really? I don't get it. If you don't wanna [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=124.64s)]
*  have a partner, if you don't wanna have a love interest, then don't have a love interest. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=129.68s)]
*  But don't give off these ridiculous reasons for breaking it off. I think it's so lame. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=133.6s)]
*  The culture of entitlement amongst younger people, I hate it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk about that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=144.88s)]
*  I hate them for being honest. It's just like this idea that your feelings need to be tended to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=145.6s)]
*  by other people. Dudes that just met you and just started dating, which you probably [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=157.04s)]
*  ain't even have sex with you yet. And they're supposed to be, my God, I need to do everything [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=163.12s)]
*  perfect for this. No, fam, we're on a mutual path to seeing if this thing could work. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=169.28s)]
*  Let's not pretend also dudes out there, these man if it dudes, I'm the prize. Bro, be the prize. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=177.28s)]
*  I'm the prize, be somebody who somebody feels like you're indispensable. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that you're sucking up to them every single day. It's just like, yo, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=195.04s)]
*  be a human being, be thoughtful. The more you spend time with each other, the more you might [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=200.72s)]
*  realize, we wanna spend more time. It's not that complicated. These little, you didn't wish me, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=205.2s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. You didn't text me as soon as you woke up. You didn't, but shut your dumb ass up. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Just shut up. Okay, I hate talking on the phone. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. And [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=219.84s)]
*  lately I've been traveling a lot for work or for whatever reason. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=227.44s)]
*  And there have been a few trips where I'm gone for a few days. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=233.68s)]
*  Christian and I will text constantly, but we don't talk on the phone. And he was a little [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=238.0s)]
*  weirded out by that because I don't call him incessantly. He's like, you never call me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=242.88s)]
*  He's not bothered by it, but he's like, is that bad? Is that weird? Is that bad? I'm like, no. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=249.12s)]
*  Why would we live together? Why would I wanna talk on the phone all day? It's so weird. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=254.56s)]
*  But I also have friends who wanna get a second you land, they wanna get that phone call. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=260.08s)]
*  So different strokes for different folks. But you gotta understand the preferences [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=265.44s)]
*  and the personality of your love interest and ask yourself, okay, when I look at the whole package, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=272.24s)]
*  is this something I'm comfortable with? Is this something I can live with or is this a deal breaker? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=278.88s)]
*  If something as small as failing to wish you a good flight is enough for you to cut someone off, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=283.52s)]
*  you're probably going to lose a lot of opportunities for really, really great relationships. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  If you're insufferable and don't deserve a man. Yeah, look, they got a lot of great sex toys from [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=297.2s)]
*  what I'm told. And those that keep you warm at night, my love. They'll keep you warm, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=304.96s)]
*  but they'll do others. Because human interaction is not your thing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=310.32s)]
*  It is just not for you. The idea that a person can't make a social faux pas [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=316.96s)]
*  without you being like, I'm cutting them off. Go ahead, go fish. You're gonna be lonely as hell. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=324.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=331.28s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=332.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=332.32s)]
*  Bruno didn't like that. Bruno didn't like what you had to say here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=332.96s)]
*  Oh, hey, it is what it is. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  So look, before we pass judgment, let's hear a bit more from her and see. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=338.32s)]
*  I'm just gonna say ahead, she's not justified, but who knows? Maybe she says something here [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  that makes us think she is justified. Let's take a look. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=353.52s)]
*  I was seeing this guy for about a month. We were seeing each other steadily for maybe once, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=356.16s)]
*  twice a week, about four, five, six weeks, and texting, calling every day. A holiday was coming [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=360.8s)]
*  up where we were both going to be out of town that weekend. I was flying out of state to visit [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=366.8s)]
*  family. He was driving out of town to visit his. So we're texting after lunch and a little bit on [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=370.32s)]
*  Friday. And I let him know, hey, since you're driving up there today, have a safe drive. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  Let me know when you get there. And I didn't hear from him all weekend. A big thing for me is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  consideration and just general care. I think I like a person who is very intentional about how [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=384.0s)]
*  they treat you, because I'm that way with people that I love and people that I am acquainted to. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=392.4s)]
*  So my travel day, my weekend with my family came and went, and I didn't hear from him until Monday. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=397.28s)]
*  He said he was back in town, asked when I would be back so that we could hang out. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=401.84s)]
*  I let him know that, unfortunately, I just wasn't interested in pursuing anything further. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=405.2s)]
*  And I thought it would be best to just move on from here. He then proceeded to call me, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=410.24s)]
*  and we spent about five or ten minutes on the phone so that I could explain to him my issue [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=414.24s)]
*  with him not telling me to have a safe flight or enjoy my weekend or even checking up on me [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=419.12s)]
*  at all that weekend. I just- [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=423.92s)]
*  I can't. I can't. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=426.88s)]
*  Yeah, same, same, same. Okay, Brooks. Brooks. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  Brooke, I should say, wrote in our comments and said the following about Brett. And I love this [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=434.4s)]
*  so much because I relate to it. Brett calls me every time he drives home from anywhere. I'm like, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  what are we doing? And then Brett responded, I see this. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  All right, Christian does the same thing. And it's actually sweet, so I've never said anything to him [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=453.84s)]
*  about it, but he's on his way home and he'll be like, need anything? And it's like, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=461.36s)]
*  no, I don't need anything. If I need anything, I'd go get it. I'm a go-getter. You know what I mean? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=465.76s)]
*  Just come home. Come home to me. I want you to be home with me. But yeah, I just, I think [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=470.72s)]
*  there are two different types of people. There are the people who want [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=477.68s)]
*  to be suffocated by their partner. And then there are people who want space and appreciate [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=482.56s)]
*  a little bit of solitude, but also love spending time with their partner. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=487.52s)]
*  I'm in that camp, right? I don't want to be on top of my, well, I don't want to be suffocated [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  and vice versa. You get what I'm saying? I love him. I love spending time with him. I feel [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=498.79999999999995s)]
*  respected by him and vice versa. But we also love our independence and our time apart. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=503.2s)]
*  And I don't need him to check in on me. In fact, I hate when people check in. Don't check in on me. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  I'll be okay. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=515.28s)]
*  Chick, you weren't flying that plane. Bro was actually driving the car. He actually needed to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  keep the safe mentality on the road because Bro was driving. You were sitting your ass on a plane. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=530.16s)]
*  Yeah, I could wish you a safe flight, but you ain't doing nothing. So why are we even [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=539.28s)]
*  talking about? He literally was driving the whip. This is insane. And then also it's like, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=545.76s)]
*  yo, we clearly don't live in the same town as our family. I'm spending time with my family. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=552.9599999999999s)]
*  Why I need to be sweating you while you with your family? I'm going to see you in LA in two days. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  Calm down. This is crazy. I wouldn't hit you. You know what's so crazy, bro? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=565.12s)]
*  What's crazy? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  As soon as she would have said, yo, I'm not trying to like, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=573.84s)]
*  no response. Keep it pushing. Have a nice life. I don't like the closure thing. I think close is [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  fake. There's no closure. Nothing's going to make you feel better about being dumped after you get [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=585.76s)]
*  dumped. I don't believe that. I want to know I'm getting dumped though. You get what I'm saying? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=590.64s)]
*  She said like, I'm not going to do this no more. We just going to move on. Whatever. Don't talk to [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=596.24s)]
*  me then. You corny anyway. I'm good. He got done a favor. This chick sucks. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=601.52s)]
*  She does suck. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=609.28s)]
*  She sucks. She's miserable and insufferable. Everything in life ain't about you, yo. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=610.64s)]
*  Life, the world doesn't revolve around you and your little ass needs, your insignificant ass [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=617.68s)]
*  need to hear, to read the word safe flight on your phone. That's insane. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=623.84s)]
*  Okay, so- I can't stand these young people, Kate. Get them out of here. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=631.36s)]
*  Oh my God. I love your raps so much. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=636.16s)]
*  It's not much, just young people. I'm just messing with Kate to be honest with you at this point. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=642.08s)]
*  No, Kate doesn't count. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=645.92s)]
*  No, she's not. Kate is young. Kate is young. Don't get me wrong. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=647.28s)]
*  She's solid, super solid. Yeah, she is super solid. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=650.72s)]
*  She's an old soul. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=653.76s)]
*  You know some people your age that be like, boy, oh my God. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=657.12s)]
*  No, but was first of all, I want to give myself a lot of credit. Okay, because [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=662.64s)]
*  I think I did what might be impossible. I found the only three insanely bright, open-minded, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=670.0s)]
*  non-zoomers zoomers to work on the main show. Right? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=680.16s)]
*  That's dope. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=683.76s)]
*  Thank you. Congratulations to me. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=684.48s)]
*  No, you deserve the credit for talent acquisition and having an eye for talent. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=685.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=690.88s)]
*  For sure, because sometimes I hear these young people talking. I'm just like, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=691.12s)]
*  they must have dropped you on your head when you was born. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=695.36s)]
*  Because you just sound dumb. You're just dumb as hell. You're just dumb as rocks. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=700.16s)]
*  Oh my God. All right, in the comments in that video, other users agreed with her logic and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=707.52s)]
*  shared their own stories. They're not tolerating their partner's lack of consideration. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  By the way, lack of consideration is a problem. Don't get me wrong. But her example- [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=718.0s)]
*  Have a safe flight is not like a consideration. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=722.48s)]
*  It's really not. Okay, so one person wrote, he texted me pics of the cookies his mom baked [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=726.0s)]
*  for Christmas, then came to my house the next day without a single cookie. Bye. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=731.44s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh my God. More. He made himself a coffee in his kitchen right in front of me [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=736.96s)]
*  and didn't make me one or even offer. That is- [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  I bet she don't even drink coffee. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  I bet you $100 she don't even drink coffee. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=747.2800000000001s)]
*  You gotta at least ask. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=749.5200000000001s)]
*  But they still want the offer. I hate that. I just want to be able to say no. I hate that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=752.4000000000001s)]
*  It's like I knew the answer already. So I didn't ask you. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=759.44s)]
*  I cut him off when he didn't make sure I got home safe after our date. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=764.0s)]
*  Because my future husband would never Christian would never do that, by the way. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=768.24s)]
*  He would never hit me up and be like, are you home safe? And I prefer that. I think. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=771.84s)]
*  The safe thing. I had a conversation with my lady about it. I get it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=777.92s)]
*  Like the sort of back in the days when we didn't have cell phones and all that. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=785.6s)]
*  If somebody got in a car accident, you just would have no way to know. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=793.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=798.4000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=798.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=799.44s)]
*  I'm just like nowadays is like, babe, if I went out and I'm with my friends, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=800.24s)]
*  something happened to me, you would have found out about it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=805.2s)]
*  Right away. Yeah. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=808.48s)]
*  Like it's just no, this like, when I get home, I need the blood. It's like, you're going to know. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=809.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=815.6s)]
*  That's how the world works now. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=815.84s)]
*  I think. Yeah. For me, like there's a fine line between showing that you're considerate of your [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=818.1600000000001s)]
*  partner. And then just kind of suffocating your partner. And I don't want to check in on my [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=826.24s)]
*  husband all day. And I don't want him to check in on me all day. I just want to live my life. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  And I get to come home and we enjoy each other's company. And like take out the trash [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=840.5600000000001s)]
*  and walk the dogs more and we're good. That's it. That's all I want. I'm a simple woman. Okay. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=847.36s)]
*  God bless you. And keep that ass fat because I love it. And that's it. That's it. Happy marriage. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh5_bvMxItQ&t=851.9200000000001s)]
