# 'Alligator Alcatraz' Proposed To Detain Immigrants In The Everglades
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ)
*  Alligator Alcatraz. This 30 square mile area is completely surrounded by the Everglades. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Presents a efficient low cost opportunity to build a temporary detention facility because [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  you don't need to invest that much in the perimeter. People get out, there's not much [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=13.44s)]
*  waiting for them other than alligators and Pythons. Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=16.88s)]
*  That was Florida Attorney General James Uthmeyer pitching a new and less fun version of Gatorland [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=21.68s)]
*  called Alligator Alcatraz. The Attorney General posted the video on X on Thursday with his pitch [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=32.16s)]
*  for the new holding facility. Let's listen to the rest of what he had to say. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Within just 30 to 60 days after we begin construction, it could be up and running [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=43.2s)]
*  and could house as many as a thousand criminal aliens. This presents a great opportunity for [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  the state of Florida to work with Miami-Dade and Collier counties. Alligator Alcatraz, we're ready [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=53.440000000000005s)]
*  to go. Uthmeyer said the facility could be built at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=58.96s)]
*  Transition Airport. They move forward on the center, it could be operational within 30 to 60 [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=67.6s)]
*  days of construction, house up to a thousand immigrants and would be surrounded by alligators [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=73.36s)]
*  and Pythons. Here's what that area looks like on a map. You could see it is in the middle [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=78.88s)]
*  of the Everglades. The Department of Homeland Security reposted the video, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  but it's not clear if the proposal will move forward. Cenk, what do you make of this? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=89.28s)]
*  I think it's a great idea to build a building on top of a swamp. That sounds like a really genius [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  move, okay? And look, this is kind of a depressing story. Sounds funny, right, Alligator Alcatraz? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=100.88s)]
*  But the reason why it's a little bit depressing is because unfortunately this appeals to Republican [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=110.0s)]
*  voters. They think like, yeah, that's cool, man, that's badass. So if somebody escapes from the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  prison, the alligator's gonna eat him to death. Is that cool? I mean, if you saw that happening [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=120.88s)]
*  in the real world, even if the guy committed a robbery or something really bad, you really want [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=126.88s)]
*  him eaten to death by alligators? I mean, maybe it's fun in a movie to get the snakes off the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=131.92s)]
*  plane or the alligators off the Everglades, whatever, right? But it's not a movie, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  it's real life. And so are they really gonna do it? Almost certainly not. But did Trump actually [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=143.12s)]
*  send people to a dungeon in El Salvador? Yeah, he did. And did the Republican voters like that? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=148.16s)]
*  Generally speaking, not all of them, but generally speaking, did a significant majority of them like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=155.04s)]
*  it? Yeah, they did. Guys, you're telling on yourself. Maybe you're good with it, but you're [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=160.48s)]
*  saying, I like cruelty. That's why your politicians are giving you cruelty. That's why this guy is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  doing an ad about like, haha, you know what, guys, vote for me, man. I wanna feed human beings to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=174.0s)]
*  the alligators. And then I wanna feed the Christians to the lions. Wait, wait, wait, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=181.36s)]
*  I didn't mean Christians. I meant just feed, well, they might be Christian, but it doesn't matter, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=186.56s)]
*  bad guys to other animals. Okay, you must be really proud. Sharon? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=191.6s)]
*  Yeah, they are proud. And it's catchy. If you're of that ilk, if you're this Florida AG who wants [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=199.52s)]
*  to raise your profile and get attention of somebody like Trump, it's a reality show. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=206.48s)]
*  Most it's fun. And so it'll get done because it's entertaining. And I think much of people [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=210.4s)]
*  who look at that and say, yeah, great. They don't allow themselves to think beyond it. What if [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=217.44s)]
*  someone's eaten and we have to see that? And I wasn't really thinking about that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=224.16s)]
*  I mean, the electorate who backs this kind of thing has already proven that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  We're not interested in the details, just the fun part, just the branding and the marketing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  So it will likely happen. And this AG has dramatically raised his profile. He's all in. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, my takeaway here is this is going to be if this were to proceed, if they did get the funds [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=245.68s)]
*  for this, it would just be a handout to contractors, construction companies that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  support Republican politicians. What they see right now is dollar signs, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=260.8s)]
*  GEO group, Poor Civic, their stock prices are going up. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=264.32s)]
*  Palantir getting huge contracts from the government to facilitate this mass deportation effort. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=267.68s)]
*  I think what they're seeing here is, hey, there's tons of money flowing around [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=273.12s)]
*  with these mass deportations. How can we get some? We've got a plot of land. Let's build a prison on [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=277.44s)]
*  it and dress it up into something that Trump's baby brain might be interested in. Alligator [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=283.44s)]
*  Alcatraz, you remember, what was a couple weeks ago, he was talking about how we need to reopen [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  Alcatraz. So it's playing into that sensibility that Trump is drawn to basic stimuli. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=294.64s)]
*  They see dollar signs, their friends, their buddies, their campaign donors benefit. It's just, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=301.84s)]
*  it's so seedy all the way around. Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=308.0s)]
*  Yeah, and so you remember Trump considered doing the electric fence at the border with a moat and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=310.23999999999995s)]
*  alligators and snakes and etc. And he asked if the military could shoot protesters in the leg. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, so guys, if you watch The Young Turks at all, you know how much I can't stand [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=328.0s)]
*  corporate donors controlling our politics. Earlier in the show, we did a story about how the bankers [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=334.56s)]
*  are basically destroying the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau through the Republican Party, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=339.12s)]
*  so that they can keep ripping off the average American and steal money from them over and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=344.16s)]
*  over again. So I loathe those guys, right? Would I want them eaten by alligators? No, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=348.24s)]
*  because that's insane. Would I want them electrocuted on a fence? No, no, I would want them [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=354.4s)]
*  to stop buying our politicians and then go away. Or if they broke a law to have the law enforced, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  justice, but actual justice, real trial. If they're found guilty by a jury of their peers, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=368.0s)]
*  you go to prison. Not you're torn apart by lions and snakes and alligators, and they shot all over [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  the legs. No, why do you need that for? Again, it's telling on yourself and it makes no sense. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=381.52s)]
*  But if you weren't depressed enough, I talked to a friend of mine in Silicon Valley [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=389.12s)]
*  just the other day, and you wanna know what the hottest stocks are in the valley? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=395.12s)]
*  No. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=399.12s)]
*  Defense tech. So everybody thinks anything that looks like Palantir, and that's literally what he [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  said. They're gonna invest into, because defense tech is taking over the government. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=407.36s)]
*  And so corporations will now largely be running the military, and they're going to make a killing, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=412.8s)]
*  well, kind of literally. And then soon they'll be running our government. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=417.92s)]
*  Okay, I think I've done a good enough job of depressing over a weekend. My work is done here. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  That's it. Thanks, Cenk. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=429.36s)]
*  Wow, I need a bottle of whiskey. Yeah, take me into the weekend. Wow. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  Don't feed anyone to alligators. It's just a simple rule. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=441.76s)]
*  How so simple? You're over. They give it too simple. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=446.0s)]
*  Yeah, Jesus. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9O2GV_BJxQ&t=454.56s)]
