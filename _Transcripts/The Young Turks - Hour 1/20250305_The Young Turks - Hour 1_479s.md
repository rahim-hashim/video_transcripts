On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# HUGE Setback for Trump's Agenda After SCOTUS Emergency Order
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0)
*  In a split decision this morning, the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=0.0s)]
*  freeze on foreign aid through the State Department and the USAID or USAID program. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=5.36s)]
*  This is a huge, huge story. It's a big deal because I think there's this assumption [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=12.16s)]
*  that the Supreme Court is always gonna side with Donald Trump. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=17.36s)]
*  Remember, he's the one who managed to nominate and confirm three conservative justices. And [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=21.36s)]
*  the thinking was that these justices are always gonna go along with Trump. But I will say, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=28.8s)]
*  Justice Amy Coney Barrett has been a surprising figure within the Supreme Court because she has [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  actually been more consistent in ruling against Trump than voting with Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=41.6s)]
*  So let me tell you what I'm talking about. So Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=46.08s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett joined the court's three liberal justices in a five to four order, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=52.64s)]
*  which was the high court's first significant move on lawsuits related to President Donald [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=58.72s)]
*  Trump's initiatives in his second term. Namely, in this case, it has to do with the freeze on [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  federal funding for foreign aid. So the lawsuit in this case was brought [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=68.24s)]
*  by the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=72.48s)]
*  So look, I'm sure a lot of you have seen news stories about some of the more ridiculous [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=77.92s)]
*  programs carried out by USAID. And honestly, I agree with the critics. I don't want tax dollars [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=82.0s)]
*  to go to some of the more ridiculous programs. I certainly don't want tax dollars to go toward [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=87.44s)]
*  efforts in causing unrest in various countries so they can engage in regime change actions. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=92.88s)]
*  I'm not in favor of that, but I am in favor of some of these health initiatives. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=99.6s)]
*  Because it's not only good for the people in these foreign countries that we're helping, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=104.4s)]
*  it's also good in preventing the spread of dangerous diseases. And so the group said that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=110.32s)]
*  the Trump administration's 90 day freeze on foreign aid had pushed organizations to the brink of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=117.44s)]
*  insolvency, forced layoffs, and delayed the delivery of life-saving HIV drugs and food [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=122.32s)]
*  assistance to unstable regions worldwide. Now, the Supreme Court has essentially, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=127.44s)]
*  through their ruling here, sent this case back to the district court, arguing that the judge, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=133.84s)]
*  who also ruled against Donald Trump, absolutely had the authority to order that the money gets [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=139.6s)]
*  paid to the programs that it was allocated for. Soon after the ruling, US District Judge Amir Ali [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=145.92s)]
*  ordered the government to develop a schedule for reinstating the payments. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=154.0s)]
*  Aid groups had argued that the Trump administration was flouting his order to pay its bills and hailed [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=158.32s)]
*  the high court's decision as a sign that the president cannot ignore the law. Now, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=165.28s)]
*  since this was an emergency order, the justices who ruled against the Trump administration did [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=170.4s)]
*  not have to explain their decision. So here's CNN's senior legal analyst Ellie Honig explaining [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=175.52s)]
*  what the Supreme Court's decision means. Let's watch. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=181.84s)]
*  I think this is a substantial setback for the Trump administration. Now, the winning side here, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=184.48s)]
*  the challengers, they had argued in the lower courts that essentially the president has no [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=190.72s)]
*  power to block this federal funding because Congress had already allocated it and under [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=195.28s)]
*  Article 1 of the Constitution, Congress has the power to tax and spend. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=199.6s)]
*  That was ultimately the argument that prevailed here. Now, the other side of it, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=203.28s)]
*  the Trump administration and the dissenters in this case argue, first of all, the district [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=207.04s)]
*  court judge had no power to do what he did, that he overstepped. Second of all, that the way this [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=211.36s)]
*  case was brought by private businesses was procedurally improper. And third, the dissenting [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=216.8s)]
*  conservative justices argue what we, the Supreme Court, should have done is put this whole thing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=222.4s)]
*  on hold so that we can have the full rounds of briefing and argument that we ordinarily have. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=227.12s)]
*  And as the dissent correctly notes, the practical impact of this is that $2 billion is almost [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=231.84s)]
*  certainly going to get out the door and nobody can stop it at this point. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  And look, the majority decision here really riled up the conservative justices who absolutely [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=240.48s)]
*  disagreed with them, of course. And these are the Supreme Court justices who have a more expansive [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=248.88s)]
*  view on executive power, which is concerning because I think it's important to have a system [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=254.0s)]
*  of checks and balances. Congress is supposed to make decisions about funding. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  The President of the United States might have the ability to implement a 90-day freeze on funding, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=266.0s)]
*  but he ultimately does not have the decision-making capability of essentially preventing [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=272.08s)]
*  the money that's been allocated from Congress from going to where it was intended. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=278.4s)]
*  And by the way, this is important to keep in mind when it comes to the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=282.64s)]
*  You guys know that I've been very critical of the policies that were passed by the Biden [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=288.4s)]
*  administration. I think the infrastructure bill privatizes too much of our public infrastructure. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=293.52s)]
*  I hate that. The Inflation Reduction Act, of course, had nothing to do with inflation. It was [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  basically a climate bill. But regardless of how I feel about it, Congress allocated funding [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=304.64s)]
*  for those policies. It is not a good precedent to have a new president get elected into office and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=312.32s)]
*  essentially dismantle everything that Congress did in the previous term or administration. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=318.56s)]
*  That would make our government totally useless. And so anyway, Justice Alito wrote the dissenting [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=325.68s)]
*  opinion joined by Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. He says, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=332.96s)]
*  does a single district court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=337.44s)]
*  compel the government of the United States to pay out and probably lose forever $2 billion [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=341.92s)]
*  in tax, $2 billion taxpayer dollars? The answer to that question should be an emphatic no. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=347.2s)]
*  But a majority of this court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=353.68s)]
*  The power of the purse lies with Congress. We have a clear system of checks and balances. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=359.52s)]
*  If Congress legislates, and by the way, and then the president signs that legislation into law, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=366.16s)]
*  how does it make sense for a new president to come in and essentially make that law null and void? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=375.28s)]
*  That would mean that, I mean, just put the shoe on the other foot. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=381.52s)]
*  Seriously. So if Biden gets elected into office and he decides, I don't like the 2017 tax bill, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=385.44s)]
*  I'm just gonna ignore it. We're gonna revert back to what the previous tax laws are. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=396.4s)]
*  Justifiably, Republicans would be upset, no? They would be upset, and they should be upset. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=401.52s)]
*  The reason why I say that is because, again, Congress has the power of the purse. And if we [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=407.76s)]
*  know, if we have a system in which a new president could just dismantle everything that was done in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=413.68s)]
*  the previous administration, then I mean, government is totally useless. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=417.76s)]
*  And I mean, it's already pretty useless as it is, Congress specifically, because of how much [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=424.24s)]
*  power they've ceded to the executive branch. But I totally disagree with the dissenting opinion [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=429.28s)]
*  here. I'm glad the Supreme Court ruled the way they did, even though I agree there is some waste [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=434.32s)]
*  in regard to USA programs. I don't think the health related programs are waste, other programs are [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=440.0s)]
*  waste. But nonetheless, this was, in my opinion, the right ruling. You can't have an expansive [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  executive branch that just ignores what Congress is up to. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=454.24s)]
*  You're really asking for a lot of harm in the future if you do that. So Amy Coney Barrett, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=458.48s)]
*  again, continues to surprise me with her rulings. I hope she continues to have [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=463.12s)]
*  principles and a moral core and rule in the right way. So we'll see what happens. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6CIZa7NX0&t=467.6s)]
