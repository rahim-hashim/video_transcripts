Video Description: Trump abruptly exits the G7 summit as he teases deeper U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict. In a rare move, AOC and several Democrats side with Republicans to try and prevent a new U.S. war. Meanwhile, the MAGA movement turns on itself—Steve Bannon blasts Fox News and insists real conservatives don't work there, while Gov. Chris Sununu distances the movement from Bannon and Tucker Carlson. Don Jr. says Trump isn’t touching his crypto fortune, even as polls show Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget is wildly unpopular. Katie Miller allegedly pressured the Social Security chief to support Elon Musk’s agenda, and Oscar-winner Javier Bardem takes a stand on Gaza. Plus, Dave Smith joins TYT for a big conversation.

# Libertarian Commentator DAVE SMITH Joins TYT After Calling For Donald Trump’s IMPEACHMENT
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls)
*  BUTT Banana [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=0.0s)]
*  revolution. I'm so upset. Oh my god. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=60.0s)]
*  All righty. Well, young Turks, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=90.0s)]
*  I'm Jake Huger Jordan Yule with you guys. So big, big show ahead. So we're talking about [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=117.36s)]
*  the potential for World War Three. So already that's kind of huge. And then we're going [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  to get into different factions with the right wing, the libertarians, the progressives, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=128.56s)]
*  etc. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=133.0s)]
*  Who's for war? Who's against war? People are choosing sides. And if you've been following [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=134.0s)]
*  the show lately, a lot of that won't surprise you. If you haven't, I realized today that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=140.12s)]
*  a lot of folks that are in the outside world and have not interacted with any of these [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=146.42s)]
*  people have no idea how much they hate war. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=152.82s)]
*  And so that's why people are always confused and confounded when I tell them that. But [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  you're about to see it with your own eyes in this show. And then I'm going to ask you [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=162.42s)]
*  guys, I'm asking you right now on the website, should we form a coalition with the right [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=167.54s)]
*  against the war with Iran? Yes or no? And well, I'm curious how you guys vote on it, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=171.58s)]
*  but nevertheless, I'm going to go forward, depends on whether you think libertarians [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=178.22s)]
*  are right wing or not. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=182.14s)]
*  But Dave Smith's going to join us at the top of the eight o'clock hour, eight o'clock Eastern. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=183.26s)]
*  He's arguably the leading libertarian in the country. And he has not only turned on the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=189.54s)]
*  war, he was never in favor of the war, but he has now turned on Trump and saying it was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=194.78s)]
*  a mistake to vote for him. And he's going as far as saying he should be impeached. But [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=199.9s)]
*  I'm going to give you guys something actionable. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=204.94s)]
*  That's what we always try to do here at TYT. We get caught trying, okay? So we're going [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=207.74s)]
*  to try to actually stop the war. And so I will explain that plan with Dave Smith at [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=212.38s)]
*  eight o'clock Eastern. So now it's a lot for a show, let alone all the news of the day. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=219.02s)]
*  So Jordan, let's get started. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=224.96s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=228.06s)]
*  Are you open to negotiating with the Iranians right now or do you want to wait? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=229.06s)]
*  I've been negotiating. I told them to do the deal. They should have done the deal. The [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=235.06s)]
*  cities have been blown to pieces and lost a lot of people. They should have done the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=239.06s)]
*  deal. I told them do the deal. So I don't know, I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=244.06s)]
*  As Israel's strikes on Iran continue and with Iran retaliating in self-defense, Americans [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=253.7s)]
*  are growing increasingly worried that Donald Trump might drag us into the conflict next. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=259.58s)]
*  And new updates today indicate that is on the table. But before we get to the latest, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=265.76s)]
*  Cenk, how are you feeling about this right now? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=270.9s)]
*  Yeah, so I think the jury's come in. Donald Trump has decided that he is going to drag [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  us into this war. I think the details of this story are really, really important because [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  it shows you how he got there and how basically Netanyahu tricked the living crap out of him [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  and how he's such a knucklehead. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=290.74s)]
*  And so he got tricked so easily into this war and now it looks like America's gonna [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=293.82s)]
*  go in not just knee deep but neck deep into this war. So let's explain. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=299.26s)]
*  Let's get into the latest. After four nights of launching missiles at Israel in heavy barrages, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=305.94s)]
*  Iran significantly scaled back its attacks overnight into Tuesday, marking the lowest [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=312.73999999999995s)]
*  volume since it began retaliating for Israel's airstrikes. Experts say the change could reflect [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=317.38s)]
*  both Iran's diminished ability to strike back and also a deliberate shift toward lower intensity [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=322.78s)]
*  attacks sustained over a longer period. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=328.58s)]
*  Now, G7 leaders, including Trump, signed a joint statement on Monday that, quote, affirms [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=332.02s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself and, quote, reiterates their support for the security [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=338.82s)]
*  of Israel. In the same statement, they called for de-escalation in the Middle East. But [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=344.82s)]
*  despite signing on to that statement, Trump seems to be taking a different tone. Axios [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=350.06s)]
*  reported today that US officials said Trump is seriously considering joining the war and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=355.12s)]
*  launching a US strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, especially its underground uranium [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=360.88s)]
*  enrichment facility in Fordow. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=367.44s)]
*  Trump has also spent the last few days conducting foreign policy by truth with this coming earlier [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=370.36s)]
*  today. We now have complete and total control over the skies over Iran. Iran has good sky [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=376.88s)]
*  trackers and other defensive equipment and plenty of it, but it doesn't compare to American-made, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=383.76s)]
*  conceived, and manufactured, quote, stuff. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=389.36s)]
*  Nobody does it better than the good old USA, followed by this. We know exactly where the so-called [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  supreme leader is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there. We are not going to take him out, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=400.88s)]
*  parentheses, kill, at least for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians or American [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=408.24s)]
*  soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=414.48s)]
*  But a post yesterday has critics both angry and alarmed. Iran should have signed the, quote, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=420.24s)]
*  deal I told them to sign. What a shame and waste of human life. Simply stated, Iran cannot have a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=426.8s)]
*  nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again. Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=434.08s)]
*  It's worth noting that Trump ripped up President Obama's Iran nuclear deal that did place limits [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=440.24s)]
*  on Iran's uranium enrichment. But more urgently, telling residents of Tehran to evacuate is [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=446.88s)]
*  extremely troubling. Tehran's population in the city alone is nearly 10 million people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=453.44s)]
*  And because of the panic that Trump induced, leaving presents a major logistical issue. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=459.12s)]
*  If you expand that area to the metropolitan area, which includes surrounding suburbs and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=464.56s)]
*  towns, its population stands at approximately 14 to 15 million. Heavy traffic congestion is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=469.04s)]
*  already common in Tehran, especially during rush hour or public holidays. But many of the roads [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=474.72s)]
*  on Tuesday were at a standstill with traffic jams throughout the city as residents attempted to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=479.76s)]
*  evacuate. Tehran is also surrounded by mountainous terrain, and exit routes are limited to fewer [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=485.2s)]
*  than a dozen arteries that lead out of the city. Al Jazeera's Dorsa Jabari spoke to some residents [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=491.52s)]
*  who had been attempting to leave Tehran, noting that a trip that usually takes seven to eight [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=497.84s)]
*  hours to reach an area by the Caspian Sea can now take between 18 to 24 hours to complete due to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  traffic. Now, one troubling factor that could lead to direct US involvement is capacity. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=510.8s)]
*  One of Iran's main nuclear facilities, Fordow, is located so deep inside a mountain that it could [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=518.8s)]
*  be effectively bombed only by the United States, which alone has the 30,000 pound bunker buster [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=524.72s)]
*  bomb that could damage the site and the B-2 stealth bomber needed to deliver it. Now, with [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=531.76s)]
*  the US possibly on the brink of a new war with Iran, French President Emmanuel Macron is urging [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=540.08s)]
*  everyone not to make the same mistake they did with Iraq. Does anyone think that what was done [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=546.1600000000001s)]
*  in Iraq in 2003 was a good idea, he told reporters in Canada where he was attending a group of seven [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=552.32s)]
*  summit? Does anyone think that what was done in Libya the previous decade was a good idea? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=558.0s)]
*  No, I think the biggest mistake today is to use military means to bring about regime change in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=565.76s)]
*  Iran, because that would mean chaos. Cenk, there's a couple things here I think that are worth [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=572.24s)]
*  pointing out. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Trump, who was purportedly the no new wars [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=577.84s)]
*  candidate, seems to be pushing us into a new war. But also, this idea that through military force, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=583.36s)]
*  we are going to lead to regime change and the population there is going to welcome and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=591.12s)]
*  celebrating it, welcome and celebrate it, leading to a stable future, seems to clash with history. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=596.0s)]
*  Well, what do you make of this? Yeah, so Trump's a sucker and a willing sucker at that. And he got [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  hoodwinked into this. And I'm gonna explain the details so you know that it wasn't just that he'd [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=610.56s)]
*  always wanted to do it. No, the dum dum got tricked into it. And is it his responsibility? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=616.24s)]
*  Of course, he's the commander in chief president of the United States. It's 100% his responsibility. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=623.52s)]
*  So I'm gonna come back to that in a second. But first, the things that Jordan shared with [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=628.32s)]
*  you guys. First of all, the G7 leaders, look, they're inching towards criticizing Israel. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=632.4s)]
*  And a couple hundred years from now, they might gather up the courage to do that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=638.48s)]
*  after Israel has wiped out the entire Middle East, right? But I mean, this statement where they [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=643.84s)]
*  quote, affirm Israel has a right to defend itself. Is that a joke? Are we supposed to laugh at that? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=649.52s)]
*  Israel started the war. Is that a thing that's allowed? Can we just go and just attack the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=655.44s)]
*  living crap out of Canada? And then if Canada fights back, we got a right to defend ourselves [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=660.96s)]
*  here. Let's obliterate Canada more. That's literally what Israel does. And so enabling them [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=666.64s)]
*  is not helping. Look, American government's nearly hopeless except for the fight back [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=673.68s)]
*  that we're gonna tell you about throughout the show from the actual grassroots, the population [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=679.68s)]
*  rising up now, cuz they've lost everyone, everyone. No one in America wants this war, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  and I'll prove that to you with the numbers in a second. But the European leaders, what are you [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=689.04s)]
*  guys doing? Why are you serving Israel loyally? What is wrong with you guys? So gather up some [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=692.2399999999999s)]
*  courage to oppose Israel, constantly attacking their neighbors and starting wars. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=698.72s)]
*  All right, so now, are we involved? Well, Trump says we have control over their skies. He said [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=704.4s)]
*  we, right? Then he talked about American weapons doing all the damage, bragging about it. American [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=710.4s)]
*  intelligence involved, American weapons involved, not just on defense, but on offense. That is [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  critical, absolutely critical. Then third way that we're involved, he says, yeah, by the way, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  we can murder your leader at any time, and we might later. If we decide that we're gonna kill [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=727.52s)]
*  you, we reserve the right to kill you. By the way, of course, if they killed our leaders, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=732.56s)]
*  whether it's US or Israel, we would say, terrorist, the worst terrorists in the world. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=736.56s)]
*  But Israel's above the law, so Israel can kill any foreign leader they like. They can also kill [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  any US citizen they like. And you're not allowed to complain about it at all, otherwise, anti-Semite. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=748.8s)]
*  So now, there are three options involved in how the next phase of the attack happens. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=755.68s)]
*  So option number one is Israel does it on their own. It turns out, guys, this is so sad, but it's [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  reported from the New York Times, okay, with a lot of internal sources. So Trump, all the way through, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=767.68s)]
*  was hesitant about attacking. He did stop an attack in April from Israel. Netanyahu's [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=774.88s)]
*  jonesing to attack Iran. Now, why now? We're gonna show you how he's been trying to get us [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=780.72s)]
*  to attack Iran for 33 straight years now. He's been lying for 33 straight years, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=786.0s)]
*  conclusive proof of that in a minute. So why now? Because they wiped out the Syrian forces. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=790.64s)]
*  Why did Assad fall as Israel did that? This whole idea of some rando Al Qaeda dude just came out of [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=798.32s)]
*  nowhere and did it? No, Israel wiped out their air force and took a portion of Western Syria and [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  cleared out the airspace. They cleared out Hezbollah, they cleared out Hamas, so they're [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=810.48s)]
*  not worried about Iranian proxies anymore. This is when Iran is most defenseless and has the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  least ability to strike Israel. So Netanyahu told the US intelligence and Trump, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  sometime in the last two months, listen, I don't really care about you. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=827.12s)]
*  You're gonna keep sending me money cuz you're a sucker and I own you, okay? So you don't have [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=831.36s)]
*  any right to do anything about what I'm doing, okay? But I'm going to go attack Iran whether [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=838.24s)]
*  you like it or not. Do you understand me? And Trump was like, okay, okay. So then they started [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  changing the game planning, the war planning inside the White House to, okay, Israel's [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=848.88s)]
*  definitely going to attack. Now there, if Trump was a man, what he would have done is, what'd you say? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=853.8399999999999s)]
*  Did you just boss me around and tell me that you're gonna do that attack even though I told [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=859.6s)]
*  you not to? Which he very clearly said in April not to. Trump told Netanyahu that. Netanyahu comes [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=863.52s)]
*  back in a couple of weeks cuz, yeah, I'm gonna do it. What are you gonna do about it, huh? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=869.12s)]
*  And Trump goes, nothing, nothing, I'm just sorry. So not a man, okay, not a leader, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=872.8s)]
*  and certainly not anti-war. So then they start planning around, okay, what do we do? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=878.24s)]
*  And that's when they presented the three options I mentioned earlier. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=884.0s)]
*  So option number one is Israel does it on their own, but now it looks like we are past that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=887.04s)]
*  option. And all the things that Jordan read you means that we are gonna do either option two or [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=893.36s)]
*  option three. Because option one was, hey, good luck. I mean, we'll obviously help in defense, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=898.16s)]
*  although I don't think that should be obvious at all. But we'll knock down all their missiles, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=905.04s)]
*  we'll get as involved as you want us to be, but we're not going on the offense, okay? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=909.04s)]
*  So we're past that. It looks like by all indications, New York Times reporting and [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=913.12s)]
*  everything that Donald Trump has said publicly, we are going to go on the offense. We are going [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=917.04s)]
*  to start a war with Iran as the United States of America. And it's Israel's war, it has nothing [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=921.84s)]
*  to do with us, nothing, nothing. They don't have nukes, it's all a lie, it has absolutely nothing [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=930.32s)]
*  to do with America. But we're going to be forced to pay for this war. We're already paying a ton [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=936.1600000000001s)]
*  of money, the press never reports that all those missiles cost money. Going around the office is [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=941.36s)]
*  gonna cost a lot more money. And God help us if we gotta go on the ground, okay. But the third option [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=945.44s)]
*  is, hey, America, you do it on your own, okay? We started it, we're not gonna fight it. We're not [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=951.12s)]
*  gonna risk precious Israeli lives. Why don't you use your worthless American soldiers to go die for [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=958.72s)]
*  us, okay? And if you think, that's not a strategy. Benjamin Netanyahu, one of the leading neocons who [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=966.48s)]
*  pushed for the Iraq war, some of the fake intelligence about the WMD was from Israel. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=972.64s)]
*  So and at the time, Israeli leaders said Iraq was their number one enemy. Now they say Iran is their [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=979.04s)]
*  number one enemy. So we have to do that work for them. But not only that, Trump already lived this [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=983.52s)]
*  with the Kusum Soleimani killing in his first term, the top military leader for Iran when they bombed [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=988.48s)]
*  him. Israel said that they were going to do it together with us. And at the last second, Netanyahu [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=994.0799999999999s)]
*  pulled out and made America do it by itself. So it would have the full responsibility. And if a war [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=998.56s)]
*  started, America would be forced to fight it, not Israel. That's who Netanyahu is. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1005.04s)]
*  So there is some chance that we're gonna go in together. And at some point, Israel's gonna go, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  not my war. Now you go fight it for me. Look at these bought corrupt politicians in America. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1016.0s)]
*  So easy to buy. You just get eight back and give them a couple hundred million dollars. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1022.0799999999999s)]
*  And then we get a couple hundred billion dollars back. The Iraq war cost trillions, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1025.84s)]
*  bunch of suckers in America for Israel to abuse. If you think, hey, wait, Cenk, come on. Now that [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1030.4s)]
*  sounds like it's hyperbole. I mean, has Netanyahu and Israel really been lying to us this whole time? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1036.24s)]
*  I mean, I hear on mainstream media that they are the beloved special ally. And that we should trust [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1041.92s)]
*  them more than anyone else. Then the rest of the Middle East combined, then the rest of the world [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1046.88s)]
*  combined, they are the special ally. They cannot be questioned. And if you do, anti-Semite. Okay, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1051.1200000000001s)]
*  so prepare for the entire country to become apparently anti-Semites by mainstream media [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1058.96s)]
*  and Washington's definition. Because you're all about to find out how much of a liar Benjamin [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1063.68s)]
*  Netanyahu and the government of Israel is. So this is a clip, by the way, put together. Anybody [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1069.04s)]
*  could have done this as usual, embarrassing that ABC News, CNN, etc. Not only doesn't do this, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1073.3600000000001s)]
*  but kind of hides it from you. It took The Daily Show to put together this clip. Now let's watch. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1084.24s)]
*  it could be within a few months. They have the wherewithal, the stored up, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1091.4399999999998s)]
*  preserved knowledge to make a bomb very quickly if they wanted to do it. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1097.1999999999998s)]
*  Iran is so dangerous, weeks away from having the fissile material for an entire arsenal of nuclear [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1101.1999999999998s)]
*  bombs. They're very close. They're six months away from being about 90% of having the rich [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1109.52s)]
*  uranium for an atom bomb. Iran is gearing up to have to produce 25 bombs, atomic bombs a year, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1114.0s)]
*  250 bombs in a decade. Ladies and gentlemen, time is running out. Iran will be capable [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1120.6399999999999s)]
*  of producing alone without importing anything, nuclear bombs within three to five years. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1127.68s)]
*  That was Benjamin Netanyahu for those of you on the audio podcast. Throughout all the years, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1134.32s)]
*  dating back to 1995, for 33 straight years, Benjamin Netanyahu and the government of Israel [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1138.88s)]
*  has been lying to America to get us to go into a war with Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1146.5600000000002s)]
*  And what they have told us, there's weeks away, they're so close. Oh my, they're on the verge, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1154.0800000000002s)]
*  he said in that 1996 clip. They were on the verge in 1996. Our intelligence, and this is now [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1159.7600000000002s)]
*  absolutely public, because Solzy Gabbard said it in congressional hearings, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1167.76s)]
*  say that Iran does not even have a uranium weapons program. It hasn't had one since 2003. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1171.84s)]
*  The Grand Ayatollah has forbidden it and even done a religious edict saying that it is immoral [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1179.6s)]
*  to develop a nuclear weapon. And our intelligence has confirmed that they do not have a bomb, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1186.0s)]
*  they're nowhere near having a bomb. All of this has always been lies. And wait, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1191.28s)]
*  what was the lie about Iraq that got us to go in? Not that they did 9-11 because they actually [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1197.04s)]
*  didn't do 9-11. Saddam Hussein, as terrible as he was, was against Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was trying [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1201.6s)]
*  to topple his government as well. So not 9-11, that was a convenient excuse. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1206.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, it was WMD, weapons of mass destruction. Oh wait, what's a nuclear weapon? All right, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1211.76s)]
*  a weapon of mass destruction. Another giant lie about WMD, and now we're getting dragged into [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1216.8s)]
*  another war. So finally come back all the way around to Trump. So Israel goes, hey listen, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1225.84s)]
*  you're not the boss of us, we're the boss of you. We're gonna go start this war in Iran and then [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1231.28s)]
*  you're gonna have to go use one of your three options where you come in and we do this. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1235.4399999999998s)]
*  Okay, so they start doing it. And then Trump, the reason they put out the statement with Marco [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1240.48s)]
*  Rubio on the first night saying, hey, this is Israel doing it, not us, is because Trump wanted [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1244.8799999999999s)]
*  to see how it went. And then on Fox News, this is why Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, and others are [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1250.08s)]
*  now in a war with Fox News. Fox News, because they know Trump is watching, puts out video reports of [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1256.96s)]
*  Israel with a genius strike inside Iran. How strong, how wonderful of Israel. They have done [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1264.72s)]
*  a brilliant job here. So then Trump watches that and it's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1271.4399999999998s)]
*  I want the credit to go to me. So he rushes out and goes, I knew it, I knew they were gonna do it. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1276.0s)]
*  We're involved. Jesus Christ, you're so easy and predictable and dumb. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1281.12s)]
*  So we're involved. So now the next and last layer is, now Israel is telling Trump, again, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1289.44s)]
*  this is New York Times reporting and the reporting in mainstream media from sources inside the White [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1296.96s)]
*  House. They're telling him, this is gonna be easy. Do you know that they said, the Neocon said, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1301.76s)]
*  that the Iraq war would only cost 1.9 billion? Instead, it literally cost at least [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1309.2s)]
*  1,000 times that. It cost over $2 trillion. And now they're telling Trump the same exact lie. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1316.48s)]
*  Donnie, this is gonna be so easy. No, no, we just bombed their nuclear, I mean, we don't do it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1324.72s)]
*  We can't do it. We don't have the capability to do it. So then why'd you start the war? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1330.56s)]
*  We knew that if we start the war, even though we can't accomplish our mission of knocking out their [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1335.04s)]
*  non-existent nukes, America will do it for us. And so now the moron Donald Trump thinks, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1340.08s)]
*  oh yeah, I'm gonna be strong like Israel. Yeah, I'll fight this war for that. I'll knock out their [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1348.8s)]
*  nukes. So they're planning, and again, they don't have that. They have nuclear facilities for energy. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1353.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's been confirmed by the world that it is for energy. Now, are they trying to enrich the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1359.2s)]
*  uranium past that? Because they started to worry that Israel is gonna attack them unless they have [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1363.44s)]
*  nukes? I don't know. I know that they're enriching uranium a little bit more now, but they don't even [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1367.68s)]
*  have a weapon to put it on. And it would take over a year for them to produce that weapon. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1373.1200000000001s)]
*  Not according to me, according to Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend. He said that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1377.1200000000001s)]
*  They're still, even by Netanyahu's standards, well over a year away from having that be a weapon. So [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1381.04s)]
*  there is no weapon to bomb there, okay? There are facilities. So we're gonna go and do that, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1387.36s)]
*  apparently. That's apparently imminent. By the way, when we do that, our troops are sitting ducks [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1393.84s)]
*  all across the Middle East. They don't have Iron Dome. They're just waiting there to get killed on [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1399.6799999999998s)]
*  behalf of Israel so that Donald Trump and the neocons can come out and go, that's it. Iran attacked [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1404.4799999999998s)]
*  America, war, war, war, war, war. And Jordan, the last part of it is, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1409.92s)]
*  boom, they move the goalposts. And you'll see this all over the media now. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1416.96s)]
*  We tell you ahead of time now, you're gonna notice it if you make the mistake of turning on cable news [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1420.96s)]
*  or engaging in mainstream media in other ways. Now it's no longer knocking out their non-existent [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1426.3200000000002s)]
*  nukes, it's a regime change. Well, how are you gonna do a regime change? Well, we're gonna kill [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1432.3200000000002s)]
*  the Ayatollah, but that's not gonna do it. They'll just replace him with another mullah, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1438.16s)]
*  and then another one and another one. You gotta go on the ground. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1441.0400000000002s)]
*  Okay, and this is how America gets suckered into another war for Israel. Jordan? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1446.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. I wanna point out the intelligence that the US [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1454.0800000000002s)]
*  had and was shared and reporters learned of earlier this year showed they were around three years [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1460.64s)]
*  away from enriching uranium to weapons grade, which would allow them to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1468.1599999999999s)]
*  But the intelligence also found that isn't even actively what they're doing. They are just using [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1476.24s)]
*  uranium and enriching uranium for medical devices, for necessities, for infrastructure. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1483.9199999999998s)]
*  And I wanna remind people that they have been subject to crippling sanctions, which worsened [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1490.08s)]
*  their healthcare system, especially during the pandemic. So that's why, in part, why they were [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1496.0s)]
*  enriching uranium on top of all of the other totally diplomatic reasons that every other [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1501.52s)]
*  country would like energy. So this idea that we have to take out their program and that in doing [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1506.96s)]
*  so we will topple their government and everyone in Iran will cheer and be happy is ludicrous. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1512.0s)]
*  You can see from history time and time again, US intervention and regime change has created a [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1516.48s)]
*  vacuum in those countries or in those regions that allow even worse actors to come in, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1522.16s)]
*  establish shop and make life a living hell. And then the US uses that as justification [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1528.3200000000002s)]
*  for permanent occupation. At what cost? How many people need to lose their lives? How many people [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1533.28s)]
*  need to be harmed? How many billions and billions or trillions of dollars do we need to waste [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1538.24s)]
*  on these types of just wasteful efforts? These kind of Don Quixote escapades. Meanwhile, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1544.0800000000002s)]
*  people here are suffering. You ask anybody in middle America who can't afford to make ends meet, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1551.12s)]
*  who's struggling to afford groceries, who's struggling to pay for their medical bills, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1556.6399999999999s)]
*  or can't afford their car payment, or even struggling to keep a roof over their head. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1561.28s)]
*  Do you think they care right now about Iran? Do you think they care about who's in charge? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1565.36s)]
*  Do you think they care about Iran's nuclear capabilities? And if you had to ask them, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1569.6s)]
*  what would you rather your tax dollars go to paying for essential services for you, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1573.6s)]
*  like SNAP and Medicaid, which are currently on the chopping block because of a reported debt and [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1578.96s)]
*  spending crisis according to Republicans. Or do you want it to go to Israel? Or do you want [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1584.16s)]
*  to go to our military so they can bomb a mountain in Iran? I'd say probably 90% if not more would [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1588.4s)]
*  say no, I'd rather my issues get taken care of. So not only is this ridiculous, not only is this [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1596.0800000000002s)]
*  harmful and dangerous for people living in Iran, you're neglecting the people that got you into [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1601.92s)]
*  office. And I know we've got more later in the hour of his base turning on him. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1606.4s)]
*  But that is an important point to drive home. Nobody wants this. Polling shows this is deeply, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1610.4s)]
*  deeply unpopular, regardless of political persuasion. Across the country, people do not want [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1616.4s)]
*  this. Only the hawks, only the military industrial complex, and potentially now Trump. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1622.16s)]
*  Yeah, so last couple things here. Yesterday we covered Tim Dillon talking about what Jordan [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1628.64s)]
*  was mentioning there. He's like, if you knocked on a trailer camp door in Arizona or something, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1634.48s)]
*  and you ask that brother, hey, what's your top three concerns? Do you think Iran would be on [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1641.92s)]
*  that list? It's a joke, right? I mean, I anize that if you put top 20, Iran wouldn't be on that list. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1646.5600000000002s)]
*  No, this only the people in Washington, the elites, the powerful want this. In fact, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1652.72s)]
*  I have a poll that absolutely positively proves that. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1656.72s)]
*  Poll came out today. Only 16% of Americans want America to get involved in the war with Iran. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1659.76s)]
*  16%. 16% is such a small number. That's like super radicals. The rest of the country looks at them [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1666.64s)]
*  like you're crazy, you're nuts. Overwhelming majority of the country does not want the US [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1674.72s)]
*  involved in this war. But almost everyone in Washington does. And they're basically giving [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1681.36s)]
*  a giant middle finger to the rest of us and going, you're on the left, you've always been anti-war. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1686.9599999999998s)]
*  We never listened to you guys anyway, right? You're on the right and you actually became [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1693.28s)]
*  anti-war and you voted for Trump because you thought he was anti-war. Suckers, we did the same [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1697.76s)]
*  thing with the Democrats. Yeah, Biden's anti-war. Did he vote for the Iraq war? Of course he did. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1704.08s)]
*  Hillary's anti-war. Did she vote for the Iraq war? John Kerry, did he vote for the Iraq war? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1709.28s)]
*  They all voted for the Iraq war, you suckers. And who started that? The Republicans did. So you go [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  to Republicans? Nope, we're gonna start the wars. Democrats, we're gonna bow our heads and go along [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1718.0800000000002s)]
*  with the wars. And who's back? Trump, he's different. He's not a unit party, he's not [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1723.04s)]
*  establishment. And he's like, baby, how can I help you? How can I start a war? So no, the same [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1726.8s)]
*  old unit party, the same old establishment. And the elites are laughing at us. They're gonna look [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1732.88s)]
*  at this. 84% of the country doesn't want it, but we're gonna make them do it anyway. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1737.76s)]
*  And those other 16% watch cable news, we brainwash the living crap out of them. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1743.44s)]
*  And they think this helps America. Hilarious. Okay, what's not gonna be funny is when we fight [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1748.08s)]
*  back. So we're gonna start that tonight. The show's live 6 to 8 PM, we'll give you the news. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1753.2s)]
*  And then at 8, oftentimes we do interviews. So tonight we'll be doing an interview with [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1758.72s)]
*  Dave Smith, one of the leading libertarians in the country. And I'm gonna propose to you guys [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1761.6s)]
*  a way that you could fight back and you could throw all these bombs out. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1765.76s)]
*  And I think it's realistic. I think it can be done. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1768.96s)]
*  Will it be done enough time to stop this initial bombing? No way. No chance of that. But later in [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1773.12s)]
*  the show, we're gonna show you that there are a couple of heroes inside Congress that are trying [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1779.6s)]
*  to stop this war. And there is a way you can help them. And we could actually, at the very, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1783.92s)]
*  very minimum, try really hard to stop this war. And if we can't stop it, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1789.2s)]
*  well, there should be deep political consequences. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1795.6000000000001s)]
*  So I'm calling that Operation Consequences. You'll see that tonight at 8 o'clock Eastern. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1799.92s)]
*  All right, we're out of time in this first segment. When we come back, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1805.8400000000001s)]
*  MAGA coalition split. Well, I was gonna say right in half, but not really. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1810.0800000000002s)]
*  The overwhelming majority are opposed to Trump here. If you don't believe it, stick around, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1815.68s)]
*  we'll show you the numbers and we'll show you the actual clips. We'll be back. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1820.8000000000002s)]
*  See, I'm good at this stuff. That's what I do. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1824.32s)]
*  Back on to our T. Let's go to our members. Boomer Dragon Cat says, shoulda, coulda, woulda. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1884.32s)]
*  The day Trump takes responsibility for his actions is the day I die of a massive heart attack. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1889.2s)]
*  No, no, don't wait on that. Look, there are things that you can believe in that [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1893.76s)]
*  are sensible and maybe they're hard to get, but it could, it's possible. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1899.2s)]
*  Trump saying, I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was doing, my bad. Absolutely impossible. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1904.3999999999999s)]
*  That's like, that's 100 out of 100 in impossibility scale. The only thing more [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1910.56s)]
*  impossible is Benjamin Netanyahu opening his mouth and telling the truth. It's never happened, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1914.72s)]
*  never going to happen. We're not gonna own it. I'm not gonna own it. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1920.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's exactly what you're gonna do. You're gonna own a bitch. Okay, so anyways. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1923.52s)]
*  So I gotta tell you about something that's happening here in LA. So if you're anywhere near LA, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1929.44s)]
*  next week, June 26th, on Thursday, we're gonna do a screening with Brave New Films. It's a movie [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1935.44s)]
*  about Palestinian journalists killed by Israel in the Gaza Strip. It is a super powerful dramatic [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1941.84s)]
*  movie. It's a free screening. I'm gonna be there. Robert Greenwald from Brave New Films is gonna be [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1950.72s)]
*  there. He's an absolute American hero who did this movie about journalists in Gaza, and it shows how [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1957.6s)]
*  Israel has killed so many journalists. It shows their actual life stories. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1964.96s)]
*  So tyt.com slash event, June 26th, Thursday, tyt.com slash event. Okay, and while you're at all of that, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1969.76s)]

*  Rebel Dragon Riders. Yay, Jordan is here. I need your dimples today. And Cenk, I need your passion. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1989.3600000000001s)]
*  I think we can deliver on both. Wind Spirit Feathers says, yes, form a coalition against war, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=1994.64s)]
*  all wars. You got that right, gonna do that. Hakuna Matata says, we'll never answer a poll [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2000.3200000000002s)]
*  more quickly than this one. It's on tyt.com. Should we form a coalition with the right against [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2005.6000000000001s)]
*  the war with Iran? That's the question. Go answer it on there. You don't have to be a member to take [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2010.64s)]
*  the poll. Hedgehog Dragon says, if Donnie puts Americans on the ground in Iran, his approval [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2014.88s)]
*  rating is going to drop faster than his hand when Melania slaps it away. That's both funny [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2018.96s)]
*  and true. Now guys, the next set of polls that come out on Trump are going to be a disaster. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2024.32s)]
*  His budget is super unpopular. My read of the situation in LA and all the military in the [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2030.72s)]
*  streets is unpopular. And then the war is super unpopular. He's gonna sink like a rock. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2037.36s)]
*  And then I'm curious what he does at that point. CB wants his Mosul Magna still hardcore with [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2044.32s)]
*  Trump. They won't turn until bombs start exploding right in front of them. Maybe, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2049.44s)]
*  no, a lot of them have already turned. Stay here, you're gonna begin to see. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2053.44s)]
*  I'll read this one just cuz it's funny. American user Reboot says, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2060.56s)]
*  I think Cenk needs his own show, right? All right, we'll be back. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2063.92s)]
*  It's nuclear warming. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2079.44s)]

*  a YouTube member on TYT. I lost my shoe is this handle. They say Trump are here. I'm really [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2147.1200000000003s)]
*  disappointed. I think that's what a lot of America first guys are feeling today. So we're gonna talk [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2154.8s)]
*  about that as we go forward. Jordan, tell us what's next. Take a look at this. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2162.8s)]
*  This vote isn't about supporting or opposing President Trump. I voted for President Trump. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2168.96s)]
*  I plan to vote for President Trump again. This vote is about exercising our constitutional [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2174.32s)]
*  authority. But more importantly, our moral obligation to decide when and where our [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2180.6400000000003s)]
*  troops are gonna be asked to give their lives. And we certainly don't need another war. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2186.5600000000004s)]
*  And if we do go to war, it needs to be with the blessing and the support of the people [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2191.12s)]
*  and a mission that our soldiers can accomplish. And we do that by following the vision of our [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2195.76s)]
*  founding fathers. We debate it here on the floor of the house. That's what this resolution is about. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2200.4s)]
*  Five years ago, GOP Congressman Thomas Massey was one of three Republican representatives [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2208.88s)]
*  that supported a resolution to stop Trump from taking military action against Iran [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2214.56s)]
*  without congressional approval. Now that our special ally Israel has waged war with Iran, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2219.52s)]
*  Massey is urging opposition to war again. Massey is one of the most outspoken Republicans [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2226.32s)]
*  in urging the President and Congress against further US military action abroad. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2233.04s)]
*  And he is consistent about this, to his credit. He posted this to X yesterday. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2237.6s)]
*  This is not our war. But if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2242.96s)]
*  Constitution. I'm introducing a bipartisan war powers resolution tomorrow to prohibit [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2248.24s)]
*  our involvement. I invite all members of Congress to co-sponsor this resolution. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2253.9199999999996s)]
*  Now, Cenk, before we get into the details and the reactions, what are your thoughts on this? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2259.8399999999997s)]
*  Cenk G. Thank God. So we should all be helping them. In fact, you know what? I'm gonna go to [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2264.3199999999997s)]
*  it later in this story. I'm gonna tell you how you can help them. So we'll talk more about it [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2273.4399999999996s)]
*  with Dave Smith at 8 o'clock Eastern tonight too. But I wanna get you started on helping this [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2277.52s)]
*  movement that has organically started in Congress. Bernie's a big part of it. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2282.56s)]
*  And the co-sponsor for Tom Massey is Ro Khanna. You see that? That's actual bipartisanship. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2287.92s)]
*  A Republican with principles and a Democrat with principles who are both against war, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2295.44s)]
*  saying not on our watch. Now, of course, the great majority of Congress is bought by AIPAC. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2299.6s)]
*  But we have a plan for that. I'll tell you about that in a minute. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2304.88s)]
*  Cenk G. Yes, Ro Khanna also very consistent on this, not just with Iran or Gaza, but also with [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2307.44s)]
*  Yemen. And he posted this. No war in Iran. It's time for every member to go on record. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2314.6400000000003s)]
*  Are you with the neocons who led us into Iraq or do you stand with the American people? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2321.76s)]
*  I'm proud to co-lead this bipartisan war powers resolution with Representative Massey. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2327.12s)]
*  That is privileged and must receive a vote. The text of the resolution states, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2332.8s)]
*  Congress hereby directs the president to terminate the use of United States armed forces from [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2338.0800000000004s)]
*  hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or military. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2344.48s)]
*  Unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2349.1200000000003s)]
*  force against Iran. It clarifies though, but the resolution should not be used to disrupt [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2356.32s)]
*  intelligence gathering or the sharing of intelligence between the United States [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2362.48s)]
*  and any coalition partner. If the president determines such sharing is appropriate and in [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2366.8s)]
*  the national security interests of the United States. Key Democratic representatives have [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2372.08s)]
*  already signaled their support to back the resolution, including AOC and Rashida Tlaib. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2376.72s)]
*  AOC said, signing on. You see that here, Rashida Tlaib. I look forward to supporting this war [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2381.76s)]
*  powers resolution. The American people aren't falling for it. Again, we were lied to about [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2387.6s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that killed millions and forever changed lives. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2394.4s)]
*  It's unconstitutional for Trump to go to war without a vote in Congress. Representative Don [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2398.7999999999997s)]
*  Beyer has also stated he would sign on. As of right now though, no other Republicans have [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2404.96s)]
*  co-sponsored the resolution. We will see if there is meaningful bipartisan support [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2410.7999999999997s)]
*  as it develops. But over in the Senate, Senators Bernie Sanders and Tim Kaine have already [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2416.56s)]
*  introduced two different but similar resolutions. Yesterday, Bernie released a statement introducing [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2421.6s)]
*  his legislation prohibiting the use of federal funds for any use of military force in or against [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2427.04s)]
*  Iran with the exception of self-defense. He posted here, tonight I introduced legislation [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2433.52s)]
*  to stop Trump from leading us into an illegal war with Iran. Another war in the Middle East [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2439.12s)]
*  could cost countless lives, waste trillions more dollars and lead to even more deaths, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2443.84s)]
*  more conflict and more displacement. The following senators are joining Bernie [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2449.1200000000003s)]
*  on the legislation. Peter Welsh, Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkley, Chris Van Hollen, Ed Markey, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2455.28s)]
*  Tammy Baldwin and Tina Smith. Senator Tim Kaine, as we mentioned earlier, filed a separate [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2461.92s)]
*  resolution but with the same premise of enacting a war powers resolution. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2469.36s)]
*  Kaine led the charge with an almost identical resolution back in 2020, which passed in both [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2473.52s)]
*  the House and the Senate, but was vetoed by Trump and failed a veto vote in the Senate. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2478.6400000000003s)]
*  In a statement regarding his most recent resolution, Senator Kaine stated, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2484.4s)]
*  it is not in our national security interest to get into war with Iran unless that war is [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2489.36s)]
*  absolutely necessary to defend the United States. I'm deeply concerned that the recent [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2494.64s)]
*  escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2500.0s)]
*  endless conflict. The American people have no interest in setting service members to fight [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2506.08s)]
*  another forever war in the Middle East. This resolution will ensure that if we decide to [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2511.6s)]
*  place our nation's men and women in uniform in a harm's way, we will have a debate and vote on it [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2516.64s)]
*  in Congress. Kaine stated earlier today that he didn't have any co-sponsors ready to announce, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2522.08s)]
*  but quote, I definitely have interest. According to a new economist and YouGov [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2528.16s)]
*  poll released earlier today, like Cenk mentioned in the last block, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2533.52s)]
*  only 16% of Americans back US involvement. 60% say the US should not be involved, 24% were unsure. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2536.72s)]
*  And the numbers are pretty similar when you get into party affiliation. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2546.48s)]
*  Just 15% of Democrats believe the US should get involved and 23% of Republicans agree. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2550.08s)]
*  More than 60% of Democrats, however, and more than 50% of Republicans believe the US should not [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2557.12s)]
*  be involved. Among Trump voters specifically, 19% believe the US should get involved in the [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2563.28s)]
*  growing conflict while 53% believe we should stay out of it. Another 28% said they were unsure. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2570.16s)]
*  But does Trump care? No, I have not reached out to Iran for peace talks in any way, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2576.88s)]
*  shape or form. This is just more highly fabricated fake news. If they want to talk, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2584.6400000000003s)]
*  they know how to reach me. They should have taken the deal that was on the table, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2590.32s)]
*  would have saved a lot of lives. Cenk, you know what would have saved a lot of lives? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2594.32s)]
*  Not ripping up the deal that was already in place simply because Obama did it. I'm going crazy here. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2598.96s)]
*  Yeah, so that's definitely true. And that deal was perfectly fine. We'd stopped their [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2606.64s)]
*  uranium enrichment program entirely. Everybody was happy with that deal, except [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2613.36s)]
*  Israel. And Israel didn't like the deal because it was a good deal. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2618.72s)]
*  And it's prevented war and they've been wanting war since 1995. We already showed you the clip [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2623.36s)]
*  of Benjamin Netanyahu since 95 to now saying, it's imminent, Iran's gotta get a nuke any day now, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2628.72s)]
*  any week now, right? So they've been lying about this from day one. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2634.48s)]
*  That's why they were furious with Obama that he made a really good [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2637.52s)]
*  peace deal with Iran that prevented them from having nukes. And he's like, what are you doing? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2640.64s)]
*  You're gonna take away my excuse to drag you guys into this war to knock out one of my [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2644.96s)]
*  regional rivals so I can dominate the Middle East and take more Palestinian land. And if you think [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2650.32s)]
*  that's conspiratorial, well, it's a conspiracy that's out in the open now, because the Israeli [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2655.28s)]
*  cabinet voted to take Gaza for Israel. But there's nobody to fight back. There's no Hamas [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2660.32s)]
*  is gone, Hezbollah is gone, etc. You can say those are terrible organizations, but Israel [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2667.52s)]
*  wanted all of them wiped off the face of the earth. And now wants Iran wiped off the face of [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2672.56s)]
*  the earth. They wanted Iraq wiped off the face of the earth. Why? So they could completely dominate [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2677.6800000000003s)]
*  and no one can complain when they take Gaza, West Bank, Western Syria, Southern Lebanon, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2682.88s)]
*  and set up greater Israel. And they have maps of greater Israel in their cabinet. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2688.32s)]
*  So it's not like they're hiding it. They talk about Judea, Samaria, etc. and how it's theirs. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2693.52s)]
*  So this is an aggressive imperial empire, but they don't wanna pay their own bills. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2699.1200000000003s)]
*  They wanna make us pay their bills. We've already given them $311 billion in adjusted inflation, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2705.36s)]
*  inflation adjusted numbers. So are we ever gonna get the 311 billion back? No, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2710.8s)]
*  they're just gonna keep it, right? Special ally only takes. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2715.28s)]
*  They dragged us into the Iraq war with fake intelligence about WMD. What are they claiming [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2718.5600000000004s)]
*  about Iran? Fake intelligence about WMD. And so how much did that cost us in the global war on [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2723.2000000000003s)]
*  terror that we didn't need at all? All of these are all the people that have attacked us, etc. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2729.28s)]
*  From the Muslim world, they're all Israel's enemies. Israel just dragged them over here [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2734.2400000000002s)]
*  to America and said, congratulations, they're now your enemies, you deal with it. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2739.28s)]
*  Global war on terrorists cost America $8 trillion. Are we gonna get that money back from Israel? No. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2743.12s)]
*  And if you ask for money back, they'll say, anti-Semite, shut up and give me your money, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2750.96s)]
*  okay? It's almost like a goddamn robbery. Now to be fair to Israel, I guess if any government can [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2758.4s)]
*  just bribe our politicians, they could all do this. And by the way, others have begun to figure it [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2764.08s)]
*  out. So Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia now funneling money to Trump, to our politicians, to our think [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2769.28s)]
*  tanks. Cuz they're like, Israel just figured it out first. It's an open auction. They allow [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2774.48s)]
*  unlimited money in politics. These idiots will let anyone bribe their politicians. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2780.48s)]
*  The Supreme Court did that. We need an amendment to go above their heads. Check out Wolfpack. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2785.76s)]
*  Okay, back to how we're gonna stop the war today. So originally I had a plan where I was gonna [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2789.44s)]
*  go on with a right winger and ask for him to pick their champion and I was gonna pick our champion. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2797.2000000000003s)]
*  Not because I'm the guy who has the credibility to pick it, etc. Forget about me. I'm totally [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2803.84s)]
*  irrelevant. But everybody agrees to who our champion is. It's Bernie Sanders, right? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2808.0s)]
*  But and I'm positive that whoever it was on the right would have picked Tom Massey. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2813.04s)]
*  And it turns out they're already champions. They don't need us to nominate them. They already did [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2817.6s)]
*  it without anybody asking them. Introducing bills to stop this war in the House and in the Senate. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2823.2s)]
*  Okay, so step one's already done. Look, by the way, getting anyone to be opposed to war [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2828.3999999999996s)]
*  in Congress is a very hard ask. When Bernie used to do it decades ago, he was sometimes the only [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2834.3999999999996s)]
*  person in Congress. Barbara Leah on Afghanistan was literally the only vote, right? So all right, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2841.9199999999996s)]
*  so step two is, well, now we all take a pledge. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2846.64s)]
*  Because this is very important before I get to step two. They have to get you to do a vote on [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2853.2799999999997s)]
*  this. War powers resolution cannot be blocked by the president cuz it checks the president's power. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2859.2799999999997s)]
*  The Congress has the power to declare a war according to the Constitution, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2865.2799999999997s)]
*  so the president cannot object, okay? And since this is what is called a privileged bill, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2868.8799999999997s)]
*  it must get a vote and it will get a vote within about 15 days. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2875.6s)]
*  So they have to wait for 15 days in committee and then vote on this right around 4th of July. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2880.7200000000003s)]
*  That is very powerful symbolism. And they're all gonna have to go on the record, okay? So step two [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2884.96s)]
*  is we all take a pledge to never, ever vote for anyone who votes for this war. Okay, if they vote [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2892.32s)]
*  no on the war, then use your own judgment. Hey, you like their policies on Medicare and taxes and [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2901.6s)]
*  all the other immigration, etc., all the other factors. But if they vote yes on this war, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2907.2s)]
*  that's it. That's the last vote they ever take, okay? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2912.4s)]
*  Now, are we going to be able to muster up enough people to do that? I don't know, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2915.7599999999998s)]
*  but I'm gonna go around the country and try to find out, okay? So who appointed me? No one, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2919.12s)]
*  other than you guys, Young Turks members, you always send me on these missions, right? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2924.3199999999997s)]
*  And so that mission starts tonight at eight o'clock with Dave Smith. Well, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2928.4s)]
*  I would argue the head of the Libertarians in this country at this point. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2932.48s)]
*  And I'm gonna ask him if he's willing to go along with this pledge. The pledge is right now on [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2935.76s)]
*  unitedagainstwar.com, okay? So check that out, unitedagainstwar.com. And it's super simple. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2940.7200000000003s)]
*  I pledge to vote against any legislator that supports US involvement in the war with Iran, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2948.56s)]
*  period. They all have to vote on it, they don't have a choice. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2954.0s)]
*  And we're all gonna see it. And step three is we're gonna track it. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2957.44s)]
*  And look, I don't know how many of us will see with the pledge, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2961.28s)]
*  how many of us are gonna vote based on that. But if it gets to a million, I bet they get [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2965.92s)]
*  uncomfortable. If it gets to 2 million, 5 million, they start to get super uncomfortable. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2970.48s)]
*  Because those votes, Republican or Democrat, are gonna be locked in, set in stone. You vote [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2975.6s)]
*  to get America into war, that's the last goddamn vote you're gonna take. That's our pledge, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2983.6s)]
*  as American citizens. Remember, only 16% want this war. The rest of us don't want it. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2988.7999999999997s)]
*  So if the rest of us rise up, if these establishment figures, the Uniparty, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2994.16s)]
*  Neocons, whatever you wanna call them, if they have awoken a sleeping giant, we're gonna find out. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=2999.8399999999997s)]
*  Now look, if Young Turks doesn't buy this by themselves, sometimes we've moved [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3006.08s)]
*  the progressives in Congress. Other times we've created, helped to create the Justice Democrats, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3009.92s)]
*  and that made a difference, etc. But we cannot do it on our own. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3016.2400000000002s)]
*  So we've gotta bring in the Libertarians for sure. They're definitely anti-war. And we've gotta bring [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3019.52s)]
*  in true America first, that actually believed in America first more than they believed in Trump. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3025.28s)]
*  If you say no, Trump's my daddy. And if he says war, then I love war. And if he says [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3032.0s)]
*  Israel first, America second, then I'm for America second. Then you're not gonna sign it, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3037.52s)]
*  and you're not gonna be interested, and you're not anti-war, you're not part of our group. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3041.68s)]
*  That's okay. Go off into the corner. Some in the radical left will say, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3045.2s)]
*  I'm never gonna work with the Republicans, never. It would taint my morality and my purity. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3049.04s)]
*  All right, go away, go away. Go sit on your couch, do whatever you're gonna do, okay? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3053.7599999999998s)]
*  But for the rest of us, for the 84%, for God's sake, let's do something. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3057.84s)]
*  So we're gonna track those guys, and if they vote yes for the war, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3063.76s)]
*  let's all pledge to make sure that they never win. And one thing that's important, guys, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3068.96s)]
*  this is not partisan. You defeat them in their primaries. So you don't have to worry, my God, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3073.36s)]
*  is this a trick to get me to vote for Republicans? Is this a trick to get me to vote for Democrats? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3079.36s)]
*  No, you eliminate them in the primary, okay? So that way you're gonna have a Republican if [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3083.6800000000003s)]
*  you're a Republican, you're gonna have a Democrat if you're a Democrat. But you're just not gonna [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3089.5200000000004s)]
*  have that incumbent who is not for this country, who's for a different country, okay? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3092.72s)]
*  We're gonna get American representatives back into Congress. That's the plan. If it doesn't work, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3097.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm fine with it, okay? If it turns out there's, look at that jank and the Young Turks and [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3103.2s)]
*  Young Turks members and all this. The good earnest people wanted to stop war who were honest, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3108.16s)]
*  ha ha, they tried but they failed. Okay, I can live with it as long as we try. Jordan. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3112.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's worth trying. I really appreciate Thomas Massey for remaining consistent and just [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3118.32s)]
*  being consistent on war powers resolutions, US involvement abroad, intervention and regime [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3127.1200000000003s)]
*  change. It's seldom you see people who are consistent on that. I think he really is the [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3134.7200000000003s)]
*  most consistent out of everyone on the broader right. We'll throw Libertarians in there to some [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3143.04s)]
*  extent. But yeah, on Gaza, on this, on Iran, both as we showed you in 2020 and now, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3148.0s)]
*  really appreciate that from him. So credit words do. Good on him and he was out early on this. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3157.52s)]
*  It's not someone waiting until it's convenient to do something. So I really, really appreciate that. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3163.52s)]
*  Good to see others jumping on. Love to see more Democrats sign on. Of course, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3168.96s)]
*  we welcome Republicans in Congress signing on. I don't know how many we'll get. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3174.64s)]
*  But yeah, I think hanging this around their necks is good, not just for preventing, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3180.0s)]
*  hopefully preventing war now, but also down the line when some of these inevitably seek [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3184.16s)]
*  potentially the presidency or if they're in the House, a Senate race. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3190.08s)]
*  Hang this around their necks in those campaigns as well. Make them wear this for the rest of [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3194.64s)]
*  their political career. You saw how that hurt Hillary in 2016. People didn't want to support [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3199.68s)]
*  her in large part because of her support for the war in Iraq. So the more we can do this and the [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3206.16s)]
*  more we can brand these career politicians who are in there to represent the military industrial [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3213.12s)]
*  complex and almost nothing else, maybe some corporate interests to diversify, but make that [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3218.16s)]
*  their political brand for the rest of their careers. I would support any and all efforts [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3224.3999999999996s)]
*  to try to do that. Yes, and look guys, the most important part of the plan is you have to vote [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3228.72s)]
*  against them. If they get away with this, they're basically saying, it's not a democracy anymore. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3235.2s)]
*  It's not your country. Whichever government comes in here and whichever corporation comes in here [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3242.0s)]
*  and bribes us, and we're told all of us are open for bribes. They are, they literally take billions [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3246.56s)]
*  of dollars in bribes, which mainstream media calls campaign contributions, because it largely [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3251.7599999999998s)]
*  goes to them when they spend ads in mainstream media, right? When they buy those ads, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3256.24s)]
*  the media is the beneficiary of all that corruption. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3261.6s)]
*  So that's why mainstream media never tells you about it, right? But any corporation in any [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3264.24s)]
*  government can buy these guys. So if these guys go, no, I don't serve America. I serve my donors [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3268.3199999999997s)]
*  and my donors at APAC, which APAC is given to almost everyone in the house, but 30 members. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3275.2799999999997s)]
*  So they control, and if you're in mainstream media and you say no, no, giving a couple of million [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3282.48s)]
*  dollars to a congressman doesn't mean you control them. You're funny, you're hilarious, but you don't [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3287.92s)]
*  even realize that you're a joke, that the rest of the country now is not listening to you anymore. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3293.44s)]
*  We think that your guys are disgusting propagandists, telling us no, politicians are so [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3299.52s)]
*  honorable, they'd never be affected by millions of dollars. What kind of a fool says that, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3305.44s)]
*  let alone a so-called reporter? So we're not listening to any of that garbage anymore. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3311.2s)]
*  So if they vote yes for this, there has to be accountability. You're the accountability. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3316.24s)]
*  That's why I'm calling this operation consequences. You take that war vote to drag America into a yet [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3322.3199999999997s)]
*  another census war in the Middle East, and there's going to be political consequences. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3329.68s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break here, guys. When we come back, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3334.8s)]
*  it's not just Tom Massey. Half of the MAGA hosts have risen up in ranging anywhere from objections [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3341.6800000000003s)]
*  to rage about this war that they did not want. We'll be back. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3348.8s)]
*  I'm a very stable genius. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3354.56s)]
*  All right, guys, we're gonna go to super chat first. But first, look, there's a lot of [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3384.56s)]
*  ways that you can help the show that are just for free, just so that you spread the word. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3397.68s)]
*  But there's actually a show that fights for anti-war, fights for you guys, fights for honesty, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3401.68s)]
*  and what's real, and doesn't give a damn about the parties. No, say that Biden's good on Israel, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3406.88s)]
*  cuz he had a strongly worded letter or call with them. No, I'm not gonna say it. I'm not gonna lie. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3412.16s)]
*  That's ridiculous. No, no, no, pretend that Trump is America first when he does Israel's bidding and [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3417.7599999999998s)]
*  starts this war. No, we're not gonna do that. We're not gonna pretend on behalf of any party [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3423.6s)]
*  or any special interests. So look, if you can join us, when you join the Young Turks, either by [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3428.72s)]
*  hitting the join button below or going to tyt.com slash join. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3436.48s)]
*  You're saying, yeah, I like what these guys are doing. I might not agree with everything they say [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3440.1600000000003s)]
*  and everything they do, but at least they're trying. They're trying to give me honest news, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3444.96s)]
*  and they're trying to make a difference in this world, a positive difference. So that's what it [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3448.7200000000003s)]
*  means to be a Young Turks member. But even if you don't wanna go there, I get it, everybody's got [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3452.56s)]
*  tight budgets, etc. At least ring the bell, share our videos, subscribe to the channel, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3456.8s)]
*  do whatever you can that takes about five seconds to help spread the word. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3463.12s)]
*  There is actually an anti-war movement in this country, a significant one if we can all [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3468.3199999999997s)]
*  rally together, okay? So now let's go to Super Chat. Chris Mailport says, I'm so effing proud of [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3472.96s)]
*  the TYT family. Cenk shows a ton of courage partnering with the other side where we agree. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3479.92s)]
*  This is how we save our soldiers, our tax dollars, and this is how we unite when we're so divided. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3485.52s)]
*  My family has hope, you gave us that. Well, Chris, thank you for saying that, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3490.64s)]
*  I appreciate that so much. Look, that's why we do Operation Hope, and those are the most wonderful [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3494.48s)]
*  people on Earth. And I told the Operation Hope guys this so many times, I want right wingers in [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3498.7999999999997s)]
*  there, I want libertarians in there. I want us to be a united country again, and a fight back. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3505.2799999999997s)]
*  If we disagree on things, that's okay, you go do that on your own, okay? We'll go do this on our [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3509.8399999999997s)]
*  own, you go do that on your own, okay? And sometimes we'll even fight if it turns out, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3513.68s)]
*  hey, you and I went on that path, I went on this path, and now we're clashing on a different issue, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3518.0s)]
*  no problem. But on issues that we agree on, and war is the most important one, for God's sake, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3522.56s)]
*  let's reunite and let's give the country a little bit of hope. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3527.36s)]
*  Okay, so now Billy Kozlowski writes in, truly absolutely ludicrous, referring to the war. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3530.88s)]
*  Idiocracy is here, referring to presumably the White House. Tyton, brother, you almost [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3538.64s)]
*  stole my line, man. I'm gonna talk about this with Dave Smith, writes in, don't look up. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3545.36s)]
*  Okay, remember that, because I'm gonna talk about looking up when we talk to Dave Smith at [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3549.52s)]
*  8 o'clock. R. Stone says, every senator who cares about America should renounce as Republicans, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3553.6800000000003s)]
*  end the big beautiful bill if he declares by decree. They helped curate his beast and they [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3558.96s)]
*  must fix it. Look, me, I hate the big beautiful bill. I think it's a giant giveaway to corporations, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3563.36s)]
*  to the rich, etc. And it takes from the average guy. And a lot of people share my sentiment, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3568.88s)]
*  we'll get to that later in the show. But for now, they're not gonna, the Republicans, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3572.8s)]
*  it's tax cuts for their donors. They're never, ever, ever going to stop that, right? So [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3577.36s)]
*  I don't want to die on that hill because that's their prize golden calf. They'll never give that [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3582.96s)]
*  up, right? But there is a better way to stop the war. Ilo Broccoli says, have you noticed how Trump [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3588.7200000000003s)]
*  backpedals as soon as Danielle contradicts him? I'm a Republican and this is pathetic. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3593.04s)]
*  Hear, hear, brother, way to be open minded. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3598.0s)]
*  All right, back on TYT, Cenk and Jordan with you guys, but also Rob Hick. He just hit the [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3622.64s)]
*  join button below. Drew Wilson gifted 20 Young Turks memberships on YouTube. Drew, you're awesome, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3626.24s)]
*  I appreciate you. Jordan, real quick, I'm gonna read two comments because I found them to be [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3631.6s)]
*  really powerful, both on Super Chat. Citi Witt wrote in, as a Jewish person, in my opinion, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3634.8799999999997s)]
*  you're now an anti-Semite. If you blindly support Israel, that's not my Jewish state. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3640.72s)]
*  Oh, I love that. See, look guys, some of the best fighters for peace are Jewish Americans, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3647.6s)]
*  okay? Bernie Sanders, Dave Smith, Glenn Greenwald, I could go on and on. They're so good, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3654.88s)]
*  sex tapes come out about them, okay? So this is not about that. And the people who conflate [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3660.2400000000002s)]
*  it are not only hurting Jewish Americans in this country, Jews across the world. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3666.48s)]
*  They don't speak for them, right? And they're doing an anti-Semitic trope of dual loyalty. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3671.76s)]
*  So I think Citi Witt is exactly right. Last one, and Guzwi Trust wrote in, Libertarian here, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3676.96s)]
*  your channel is chill AF and fun to listen to. You guys have come a long way and I respect you for [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3682.16s)]
*  reaching across the aisle. I pledge to not vote for anyone who votes for this war. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3689.8399999999997s)]
*  We're on the board, okay? So there we go, unitedagainstwar.com. Jordan, what's next? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3694.8799999999997s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3700.7999999999997s)]
*  Trump, it feels like he's a little bit at war with himself because he said all the time. I mean, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3704.3199999999997s)]
*  he wants to be known as the peacemaker, the deal maker, the guy who ends wars. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3709.12s)]
*  And yet here he finds himself defending another war. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3713.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, I don't know, I don't think Trump's defending the war. Trump's defending [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3717.12s)]
*  Israel's actions and within a week or two, he's gonna try to find an off ramp to bring it to [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3720.0s)]
*  peace. And as for Tucker Carlson, C. Bannon, they do not define what the MAG or the conservative [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3723.68s)]
*  base is. There's two idiot conspiracy theorists. The base, the MAGA base, the conservative base, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3728.0s)]
*  believe me, they're all behind Trump and that's it. He's the one that calls the shots on what kind [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3732.56s)]
*  of defines that MAGA base. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3736.64s)]
*  The neocons and the Republican Party are out in full force, desperately trying to define [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3738.8799999999997s)]
*  themselves as true MAGA as they push for war with Iran. There you had former New Hampshire [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3746.48s)]
*  Governor Chris Sununu dismissing Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon as idiots for being the loudest [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3752.96s)]
*  opponents of Trump's decision to lead us head first into war. But before we move on here for [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3758.72s)]
*  more war hawkery from neocons, Cenk, what do you think of Sununu's claims? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3766.08s)]
*  Cenk What [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3770.72s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon don't represent MAGA. Instead, neocon war hawks represent MAGA [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3771.84s)]
*  and they're all behind Trump in invading Iran. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3781.6s)]
*  What's amazing about that, guys, is that no one else on that panel realizes that that's not even [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3789.2s)]
*  remotely true. That's not within miles of true, right? But they're all, yeah, because all they do [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3795.44s)]
*  is bring on establishment people and establish people, yeah, MAGA sucks, right? I mean, MAGA's [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3802.32s)]
*  pro-war, right? Right, right, MAGA's pro-war, yeah, yeah, totally agree. And even Scott Jennings is [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3807.6s)]
*  like, yeah, MAGA's great and Sununu, who fought Trump the entire time, now pretending to be on [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3811.84s)]
*  Trump, so when Trump said it, that's MAGA. You're the real man, Sununu, and who was, if I remember [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3816.8s)]
*  right, was a never-Trump-er. You're the real MAGA, but Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon are [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3824.16s)]
*  the fake MAGA? Look, I got a thousand problems with Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3829.52s)]
*  but they're definitely real MAGA. Wait, a thousand times more real than Sununu [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3835.3599999999997s)]
*  or anyone on television pretending to be like know what populace thing. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3842.72s)]
*  Although they are gonna get a rude awakening, potentially could get a rude awakening tonight. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3848.7999999999997s)]
*  Because for the first time, a populace is going to be on that panel, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3854.24s)]
*  Anna Kasparian on that exact show tonight at 10 o'clock Eastern. Anything can happen, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3857.92s)]
*  okay, but these guys are a joke. So let's tell you about all the Republicans who are trying to start [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3865.2799999999997s)]
*  the war, and later in the show, we'll show you the Republicans or the MAGA guys who are against the [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3872.3199999999997s)]
*  war. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3877.28s)]
*  So we'll get into more. Mark Levin joined in once again on the Tucker bashing, writing a blistering [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3879.52s)]
*  op-ed in the New York Post telling MAGA Republicans to ignore the isolationists. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3886.6400000000003s)]
*  In it, he claims isolationism is just appeasement that promotes war. Even worse, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3892.1600000000003s)]
*  these knuckleheads can't coherently explain what they mean. Have you watched them on TV? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3899.1200000000003s)]
*  They're too self-righteous in their ignorance to realize how absurd they sound. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3903.84s)]
*  They don't agree among themselves. What the hell they're talking about. He also insists that the [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3907.84s)]
*  current foreign policy is nothing like the recent failed policies we've seen in Iraq, Afghanistan, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3913.2000000000003s)]
*  and elsewhere. President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are together [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3919.04s)]
*  demonstrating how to deal with a genocidal terrorist regime. How to use diplomacy and [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3923.76s)]
*  military power. How to use intel and special forces. How to use the media and public statements [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3930.64s)]
*  and more to defeat the biggest terror supporting regime on the planet. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3937.2799999999997s)]
*  It is and has been brilliant. And if all goes well, it will result in a transformed Middle East, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3943.52s)]
*  an expansion of the Abraham Accords, and a world free of a nuclear terror regime. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3949.6s)]
*  If all goes well is doing a lot of work in that sentence. Yet the isolationists such as Chatsworth [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3955.76s)]
*  Carlson, referring to Tucker Carlson, are turning on our president as they've spent [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3964.0800000000004s)]
*  months demeaning Netanyahu. They prefer the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3970.6400000000003s)]
*  who is apparently more MAGA than Trump. These reprobates have never been MAGA. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3976.0800000000004s)]
*  The isolationists tell us that to oppose a regime change war in Iran is to be a warmonger [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3982.48s)]
*  and anti-MAGA. Just close your eyes and cover your ears. They also don't seem to care that they [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3990.32s)]
*  attract Marxists, Islamists, and anti-Semites. Unfortunately, every indication so far is that [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=3996.64s)]
*  Trump is siding with these people and not his MAGA base. Last night he posted a truly insane [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4004.64s)]
*  text he received from Mike Huckabee, his ambassador to Israel. It read, Mr. President, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4010.4s)]
*  God spared you in Butler, Pennsylvania to be the most consequential president in a century, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4016.96s)]
*  maybe ever. The decisions on your shoulders, I would not want to be made by anyone else. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4022.64s)]
*  You have many voices speaking to you, sir, but there is only one voice that matters, his voice. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4030.2400000000002s)]
*  I am your anointed servant in this land and am available for you, but I do not try to get [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4036.48s)]
*  in your presence often because I trust your instincts. No president in my lifetime has been [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4044.0s)]
*  in a position like yours, not since Truman in 1945. I don't reach out to persuade you, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4049.44s)]
*  only to encourage you. I believe you will hear from heaven, and that voice is far more important [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4055.84s)]
*  than mine or anyone else's. You sent me to Israel to be your eyes, ears, and voice, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4062.24s)]
*  and to make sure our flag flies above our embassy. My job is to be the last one to leave. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4067.04s)]
*  I will not abandon this post. Our flag will not come down. You did not seek this moment. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4073.52s)]
*  This moment sought you. It is my honor to serve you. Cenk, do you think heaven is telling Trump [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4079.7599999999998s)]
*  to bomb Iran? I wonder if it's telling Huckabee to swallow or spit. So he's been doing hard work [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4087.12s)]
*  praying on his knees in Israel to serve his true master. Anyways, so the trick that Huckabee's [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4097.92s)]
*  doing is, yeah, God wants you to start a war. How do I know? I talked to him. Did you? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4106.96s)]
*  Did God, I mean, you want to talk about blasphemous? Huckabee, did you talk to God? Who talked to God? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4114.240000000001s)]
*  They asked him specifically, should we help Israel attack Iran? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4120.8s)]
*  Should we help kill civilians there? Should we bring American troops to die there? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4125.360000000001s)]
*  Should we spend trillions? You ask God that? I can't imagine anything more blasphemous than this guy [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4129.360000000001s)]
*  pretending to speak for God. And he does the obvious trick, but to Trump it won't be obvious at all. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4134.72s)]
*  He's like, God has picked you. You're so special and wonderful, but only if you attack Iran. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4141.4400000000005s)]
*  If you attack Iran, then God selected you for this, and you're pretty much a prophet. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4150.400000000001s)]
*  You know Trump's gonna eat that up, right? Yes, yes, God has selected me to murder people in [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4156.16s)]
*  Iran on behalf of Israel and to spend America's children and fortune on it. Has he, or is my [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4162.96s)]
*  Huckabee a low grade con man? Okay, why don't you go sell some fricking tupperware in Arkansas? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4170.08s)]
*  Okay, and by the way, that would be far more noble than what he's doing, a thousand times more [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4176.8s)]
*  noble than what Huckabee's doing now. But the scary part of what Huckabee said was about 1945. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4182.4800000000005s)]
*  Why did that get into this conversation? You know what happened in 45, Truman dropped a bomb. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4189.200000000001s)]
*  Jordan, I don't know, that scared the hell out of me because I'm like, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4195.2s)]
*  is there talk of like a nuclear bunker buster that they're gonna use on those [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4201.2s)]
*  Iranian facilities? Because why is he mentioning 1945? That's not a World War II reference. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4205.2s)]
*  That's a Hiroshima and Nagasaki reference. Truman had the courage to use nuclear weapons. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4214.0s)]
*  And by the way, if Israel wants to nuke Iran, you think they're gonna use their own nukes [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4222.0s)]
*  and be held culpable for that? No, they're gonna get a moron like Donald Trump to do their dirty [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4227.04s)]
*  work for them so that when the world explodes in rage, it's not against Israel. They're gonna say, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4233.5199999999995s)]
*  well, I had nothing to do with it. I'm not America, right? And that rage is gonna be [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4239.76s)]
*  directed to all of us. And then mainstream media is gonna come and tell you they hate us [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4246.4s)]
*  cuz they hate us just randomly for no reason at all. They hate us cuz they hate us. Look, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4249.92s)]
*  are they gonna do that? I don't know. I hope not. It's just one reference. Don't over panic about [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4254.88s)]
*  it, but it was a weird, weird thing. Guys, I gotta show you the Charlie Kirk poll. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4262.24s)]
*  So later in the show, in fact, the next story we'll do after the break is about [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4266.16s)]
*  MAGA that's turned on Trump. And that's why you're seeing this battle in this war between [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4270.32s)]
*  neocons. Everybody we just read from is a neocon or a Christian Zionist, all either working for [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4274.8s)]
*  Israel or have some deranged genocidal fantasies of their own like Huckabee does, okay? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4281.360000000001s)]
*  So Charlie Kirk asked his own audience, and remember Charlie Kirk said, I love Israel, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4288.24s)]
*  I love Israel, Israel the greatest, right? But I'm a little concerned. Why is he a little concerned? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4292.0s)]
*  Cuz his own audience is like, are you kidding me, Charlie? Are you kidding me? We all said anti-war. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4296.400000000001s)]
*  So he does a poll, and let's find out, is MAGA really anti-war or not? Maybe it's 50-50, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4302.08s)]
*  maybe it's 90-10. Well, I'll tell you what it was, 90-10 against the war. Charlie Kirk's audience, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4308.0s)]
*  deeply right wing, 90 to 10, not interested in this war, not interested in Huckabee's BS, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4317.12s)]
*  not interested in all these neocons. And a lot of what MAGA is saying all over the internet, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4325.04s)]
*  I know if you haven't seen it, you think, really, that can't be. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4330.16s)]
*  I mean, four years ago, they all agreed with Trump no matter what. Well, it's a different MAGA. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4333.28s)]
*  And this time around, they mean a lot of what they say. And so what they're saying is, listen, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4338.8s)]
*  brother, we didn't pick you to be America's second. We said anti-war, we meant anti-war. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4345.92s)]
*  And if you're pro-war and you're just gonna serve Israel, we're not interested. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4351.2s)]
*  So that's why there's this huge drift. And that is why they're trying to keep Trump in a little [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4355.92s)]
*  bit of a cocoon, where they're like, don't, don't, don't, just watch TV. Turn on Fox News for him, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4362.24s)]
*  turn on Fox News. That's why Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson are attacking Fox News, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4367.28s)]
*  which is what we're gonna show you next. So they're like, don't talk to Tucker, Tucker's [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4371.04s)]
*  kooky. Tucker's not even on TV. That's why Trump said, Tucker's not even on TV, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4376.32s)]
*  because somebody whispered that in his ear. Don't do it and don't watch anything that isn't on TV, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4380.32s)]
*  because then you might find out that your base has left the building, okay? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4385.12s)]
*  So he doesn't realize it. But when those new poll numbers come out and he's in the goddamn [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4389.28s)]
*  20s, yes, I said 20s, people could say, you're nuts, he was at 45 in the last poll. You think [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4393.84s)]
*  he's gonna drop to like 29 or something? Yes, I do. Yes, I do, because no one wants this war. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4398.719999999999s)]
*  Only the Warhawk establishment, uniparty elites in Washington do, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4405.6s)]
*  and they're in for a rude awakening. The American people are gonna despise this. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4411.6s)]
*  All right, we're out of time. When we come back from the break, finally we show you the [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4416.4800000000005s)]
*  MAGA revolt. It has increased against Donald Trump. More and more voices now coming out going, nope, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4421.6s)]
*  nope, nope, nope, we did not vote for this. And then eight o'clock, Dave Smith joins the rebellion. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4428.8s)]
*  We'll be back. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4434.56s)]
*  Next, that's what's happening at the border. The things that got him banned, he's still spreading. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4465.4400000000005s)]
*  So presumably, I think it's reasonable to say that if you allow him back on the website, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4469.76s)]
*  he's going to do it again. Any legal voter that we deem not willing to vote for my side [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4472.88s)]
*  shouldn't vote because it'll replace me. They're supposed to vote for my side. That's not how [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4477.76s)]
*  voting works. That's not how democracy worked. And while many people following today's political [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4481.4400000000005s)]
*  news can get discouraged about the direction of the nation and the world, that's not us. At TYT, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4485.52s)]
*  we're genuinely optimistic about the future. And with good reason. Today, wide majorities [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4490.64s)]
*  of Americans agree with our progressive stances on issues ranging from healthcare and education [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4495.12s)]
*  to climate, immigration, and wages. The rising generation of young people are also overwhelmingly [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4500.08s)]
*  progressive in their political beliefs and policy objectives. And they're increasingly flexing their [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4505.360000000001s)]
*  muscle as voters and activists to demand change from our elected officials. The traditional [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4510.0s)]
*  mainstream media is mostly AWOL. They, along with the government and many other cherished [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4515.52s)]
*  institutions, have been captured by corporate interests. Audiences sense that they're not [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4519.68s)]
*  getting the whole story or even the truth from once trusted outlets, whether broadcasting cable [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4523.92s)]
*  TV news networks or national newspapers and magazines. The antidote is the young Turks. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4528.64s)]
*  Unlike mainstream corporate outlets, we're not beholden to corporate advertisers, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4534.08s)]
*  the defense contractors, the Wall Street or the Big Pharma. And we don't carry water for the [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4538.0s)]
*  Republican or Democratic parties. So watch us Monday to Friday at 6 PM Eastern, 3 PM Pacific, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4542.64s)]

*  we do original exclusive investigative reporting. You'll find nowhere else. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4573.28s)]

*  specific forms of abuse and discrimination in the federal prison system. We're catching these [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4591.68s)]

*  situation being created. A black woman who was driving for Uber was allegedly assaulted by a [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4613.92s)]
*  white male passenger. After we got involved, roughly 24 hours later, the police all of a sudden [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4620.72s)]
*  opened up an investigation. What was going through your mind when bullets were simply flying inside [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4627.28s)]

*  the description of somebody they were looking for? Did they say that? Never. Okay, that means they [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4639.280000000001s)]

*  you took me in. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4686.08s)]
*  All right, back on TYT. Cenk, Huger, and Yasmin, come with you guys. Yasmin and Jordan are both [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4716.48s)]

*  like ending this war. Veronica Orr became a member and gifted a membership. Veronica, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4735.76s)]
*  you're awesome. And I'm going to read one comment, Yaz, before we go back to our stories. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4739.6s)]
*  Veronica also wrote in Super Chat. I'm a Latina who voted for Trump. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4744.56s)]
*  I lost friends and family. My mom hasn't spoken to me since election day. I spent 10,000 to fly [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4749.12s)]
*  my family to the inauguration. It took them five months to betray us. So, Veronica, thank you for [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4754.64s)]
*  keeping an open mind in terms of realizing that he did betray you. And I'm not going to do what [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4763.2s)]
*  everybody else does, like, haha, yeah, you should have known better. No, no, no. Thank you for having [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4769.76s)]
*  an open mind and seeing what he's actually done. And welcome back. And this is not a show for the [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4774.88s)]
*  Democratic establishment, okay? So we're not going to tell you, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4782.24s)]
*  are amazing. They ran perfect campaigns. They're both 13 years old. Don't worry, Biden's not too [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4786.72s)]
*  old. No, we're not going to lie to you like a lot of other shows lie to you, right? No, our job is [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4793.84s)]
*  to deliver for the audience, for the average American, and not for any party in power. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4798.8s)]
*  They're all full of crap. So we got to get our country back and we're going to do it together. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4803.92s)]
*  All right, now, Yaz, an important story regarding Iran. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4809.04s)]
*  Yeah, kind of exactly that. So let's roll the tape. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4812.96s)]
*  There's an awful lot of people I notice right now saying how they're true MAGA and they're pure MAGA. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4816.320000000001s)]
*  I don't think anybody at Fox can possibly be true MAGA and hardcore MAGA. And the reason is, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4824.0s)]
*  to be brutally frank, when President Trump had the election stolen from him [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4829.92s)]
*  and had the White House taken away because everybody at Fox takes a paycheck from Murdoch, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4834.64s)]
*  you all supported DeSantis and Nikki Haley and whoever else came along, right, as an opportunity [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4839.5199999999995s)]
*  to replace President Trump. So if you work at Fox by definition, you can't be true MAGA. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4846.16s)]
*  It's impossible. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4852.08s)]
*  Well, as Cenk said, they're all full of crap. The Republican Civil War has reached the point [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4855.44s)]
*  where right wingers are now attacking Fox News. On multiple occasions this week, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4860.5599999999995s)]
*  Steve Bannon called out the conservative network and even went so far as to claim [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4866.08s)]
*  that if you work there, you can't be true MAGA. Here's another moment from just a few days ago. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4870.8s)]
*  I don't hear, we got American troops in Iraq. Why we got American troops in Iraq? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4877.6s)]
*  Because Fox News and all of them and Bush lied to us, lied. This was not a, it wasn't a [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4881.44s)]
*  failure of intelligence or we made some bad calculations. It was bald face lies. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4891.759999999999s)]
*  So we're gonna go a little bit deeper into the war within Trump's base. But first Cenk, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4897.12s)]
*  we've seen hints of this in the past where they would attack Fox News or just things that were [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4905.36s)]
*  said on Fox News, certain anchors or whatever, different hosts. But we've never really seen [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4910.88s)]
*  anything quite to this extent. So are you surprised that we're seeing them completely just turn their [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4915.68s)]
*  backs on Fox News? Because it's almost like, where are they gonna get their news from? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4920.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's the state of affairs now that is so interesting. They are not getting their news [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4925.84s)]
*  from Fox News as much as they used to. Now there's tons of people still watch Fox News. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4931.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's why people online refer to like boomer neocons that got brainwashed by Fox News. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4935.36s)]
*  Because where I disagree with Steve Bannon on a ton of things, including that the 2020 election [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4942.5599999999995s)]
*  was stolen. No, it wasn't, okay? So there's plenty to assume because we're on different sides. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4948.88s)]
*  That's why I don't agree with Steve Bannon on that. But he's now telling his audience the truth about [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4953.759999999999s)]
*  Fox News. It's because they're now political opponents, right? Bannon doesn't wanna go into [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4958.64s)]
*  Iran and Fox News definitely wants to start another war. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4966.4800000000005s)]
*  But in the midst of this fight, they're beginning to spill the tea about each other. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4970.400000000001s)]
*  And Bannon is absolutely correct that Fox News lied us into Iraq war. One of the top people who [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4974.64s)]
*  did that was Sean Hannity. So you're gonna see here, they're in open warfare against each other. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4980.08s)]
*  So Tucker Carlson also hit Sean Hannity saying along similar lines, you guys have started wars [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4985.36s)]
*  before, you wanna start wars now. And so I love that they're in open revolt. And I think that [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4990.96s)]
*  you have to give credit where credit is due. Not that they're right about everything, guys. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=4998.96s)]
*  Just agreeing on one thing or giving one piece of credit honestly does not mean you agree with [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5002.96s)]
*  everything they say, please, please. Just this is not that hard to figure out, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5009.04s)]
*  okay? But on this, can you agree with Steve Bannon that Fox News lied right wingers into [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5014.72s)]
*  the war with Iraq? Of course they did, of course that's true. And are they trying to line them into [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5021.04s)]
*  the war in Iran? Absolutely, Rupert Murdoch is the biggest warmonger of my lifetime. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5026.72s)]
*  There is an award that he hasn't wanted to snuggle with and make out with and push onto [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5034.56s)]
*  the American people and make us fight it, make us pay for it. So the fact that they're taking on [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5040.320000000001s)]
*  Murdoch and Fox News is awesome news. And yes, you're gonna see it in the comments that she's [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5045.52s)]
*  gonna read for you guys from other maga, etc. In the beginning, they don't wanna take on [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5051.4400000000005s)]
*  Daddy Trump because they're worried that everybody on their side likes Trump. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5057.4400000000005s)]
*  And strategically, they're not wrong from their point of view on their side, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5062.0s)]
*  cuz they're trying to win Trump over to their side. And if they insult him even a tiny bit, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5066.8s)]
*  you know how thin skin he is. No, they hurt my feelings. I'm going with the neocots, right? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5071.76s)]
*  Yeah, he'll do that until his polling's in the 20s. Anyways, so that's why instead of directly [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5077.68s)]
*  attacking Trump, they're attacking one another and they're attacking Fox News. And they're going to [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5084.32s)]
*  war internally and trying to win Trump over to their side. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5090.0s)]
*  Yeah, it all feels very passive aggressive and a strange way for them to achieve whatever goals [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5093.52s)]
*  are actually after. I also love that you mentioned the war in Iraq, but let me not get too far ahead [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5099.52s)]
*  of myself. Let me get to the story first, then we'll get to that. So in addition to attacking [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5104.4s)]
*  Fox News, Steve Bannon is putting out a dire warning. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5109.2s)]
*  he and Tucker were careful to put most of the blame for Trump's foreign policy decisions [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5115.04s)]
*  on the Warhawks surrounding him rather than Trump himself. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5120.08s)]
*  But they did say that getting involved in another foreign war would break up Trump's coalition. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5124.32s)]
*  Take a look. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5129.68s)]
*  Donald J. Trump gets elected in November on the back of this amazing coalition, unprecedented [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5131.68s)]
*  coalition. But this coalition, which you described earlier and more precisely than anybody by far, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5136.88s)]
*  is the defining fact of American politics. And it kind of feels like it's being blown up [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5145.36s)]
*  over this war in Iran. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5151.44s)]
*  And I'm a big supporter of Israel. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5152.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5154.56s)]
*  And I'm telling people, hey, if we get sucked into this war, which inexorably looks like it's [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5154.96s)]
*  going to happen on the combat side, it's going to not just blow up the coalition. It's also [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5160.72s)]
*  going to thwart what we're doing with the most important thing, which is the deportation of [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5165.68s)]
*  the illegal alien invaders that are here. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5170.8s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump, for his part, as you can imagine, is not too happy that his former friend [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5175.6s)]
*  and ally, Tucker Carlson, is calling him out publicly. So here's how Trump [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5180.72s)]
*  responded to a reporter's question about Tucker yesterday. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5185.6s)]
*  I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying. Let him go get a television network and say it so [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5188.8s)]
*  that people listen. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5200.56s)]
*  Quickly, have you spoken? [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5201.44s)]
*  And on Truth Social last night, he posted this. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5205.04s)]
*  Somebody please explain to Kookie Tucker Carlson that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5208.24s)]
*  But you might be surprised at who took Tucker's side in this fight. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5214.96s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, typically one of the biggest Trump bootlickers there is, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5218.8s)]
*  responded to Trump on X. She had a lot to say. She said, Tucker Carlson is one of my favorite [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5223.679999999999s)]
*  people. He fiercely loves his wife, children and our country. Since being fired by the [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5228.64s)]
*  Neocon network, Fox News, he has more popularity and viewers than ever before. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5233.92s)]
*  He unapologetically believes the same things I do, that if we don't fight for our country and [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5239.4400000000005s)]
*  our own people, then we will no longer have a country for our children and our grandchildren. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5245.200000000001s)]
*  And foreign wars, intervention, regime change, put America last, kill innocent people, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5250.400000000001s)]
*  are making us broke and will ultimately lead to our destruction. That's not Kookie, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5256.88s)]
*  that's what millions of Americans voted for. It's what we believe is America first. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5262.0s)]
*  So Candace Owens responded to Trump's attack on Tucker with this. She said Donald Trump just [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5268.4800000000005s)]
*  completely fractured his base. And he did it for the very Neocons who minted the Never Trump [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5273.92s)]
*  movement, truly unbelievable. And of course, Alex Jones backed him up saying, I am proud [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5279.52s)]
*  that Tucker Carlson is standing his ground against the psychotic, war mongering Neocons [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5285.76s)]
*  that have brought the world to the verge of thermal nuclear Armageddon. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5291.2s)]
*  So what we're witnessing here is imperialism. And Israel is simply following the American example, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5296.64s)]
*  which is I think what you were alluding to earlier, Cenk. This reeks of 9-11 and the post-9-11 era, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5303.76s)]
*  and the war in Iraq when we invaded a country that had nothing to do with 9-11, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5309.76s)]
*  citing weapons of mass destruction that we never found, calling it a preemptive strike against them, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5314.24s)]
*  which is literally what's happening right now with Israel and Iran. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5320.24s)]
*  And a significant portion of the American people supported it at the time because honestly, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5323.36s)]
*  we didn't know any better. And I know that's a bit of an oversimplification of the mood of that time, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5327.92s)]
*  but it's essentially what it boiled down to. And the Israelis who see themselves still as [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5333.92s)]
*  victims in all of this, according to reports at least, they support what their government is [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5338.16s)]
*  doing in Iran. Meanwhile, Netanyahu is making an absolute fool out of Donald Trump, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5342.72s)]
*  which would be hilarious if it wasn't actually so dangerous and deadly. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5348.0s)]
*  But Americans do not want to get involved with any of this. That's what Marjorie Taylor Green [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5352.16s)]
*  was referencing. This is not what Trump voters actually voted for. They voted for a no-war [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5356.96s)]
*  president. So seeing him on the verge of engaging in Iran is very troubling for a lot of them, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5362.4800000000005s)]
*  and it should be. And seeing these debates happening within right-wing media is sort of [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5368.24s)]
*  encouraging because we're so used to Fox News viewers only ever getting one side of a story, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5373.2s)]
*  or only getting the Trump-approved perspective or the messaging. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5379.04s)]
*  It would be nice if these conversations actually had some bearing on the administration and the [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5383.44s)]
*  way that it proceeds. But Trump, honestly, he's just gonna do whatever makes him look and feel [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5387.599999999999s)]
*  the most powerful. So what do you think, Cenk? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5392.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, in the first hour, I explained how Trump had Rubio put out the statement saying we were [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5395.200000000001s)]
*  not involved in that attack on the first night cuz he didn't know how it was gonna go. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5402.320000000001s)]
*  But the next morning when he was watching Fox News, they made it sound like it was such a strong [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5406.240000000001s)]
*  and brilliant maneuver by Israel. And they kept complimenting with the genius of the Israeli [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5414.320000000001s)]
*  military. That's why Bannon and Tucker and Marjorie Taylor Greene, etc., are telling you [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5420.16s)]
*  not to watch Fox News. That was a propaganda trick designed to appeal to one man, Donald Trump. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5425.44s)]
*  And it totally worked. So Trump, according to the New York Times reporting from inside sources [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5431.5199999999995s)]
*  in the White House, then was like, yeah, it's strong and brilliant. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5437.599999999999s)]
*  I did that, it's me, it's me. And then he came out and sort of take ownership over it, like, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5442.4s)]
*  we control the skies and you never know what we're gonna do. And they didn't come to the [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5447.52s)]
*  negotiating table and that's why we did this. And today he's been all we, we, we, we have the best [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5451.68s)]
*  weapons and sources. And that's why we use intelligence against Iran and we knocked out [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5458.0s)]
*  their ability to defend themselves. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5464.0s)]
*  So he's now bragging that we not only helped Israel defend themselves, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5466.8s)]
*  but also went on the offense against Iran. Because Fox News was like, whoever did this is a genius. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5471.040000000001s)]
*  And strong, and he's like, okay, that's me, that's me. God, what a fool, so easy to manipulate. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5477.36s)]
*  So now look, you talked about the Iraq war. And at the time, yeah, that's true, not a lot of Americans [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5484.16s)]
*  saw that coming, but they were lied to. So mainstream media, including Fox News, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5490.24s)]
*  Fox News is part of mainstream media. Overwhelmingly told him the lie over and over and over again, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5495.04s)]
*  that Iraq had something to do with 9-11. Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11. Iraq was opposed to [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5502.4s)]
*  Al Qaeda. Instead, they did this racist thing of Muslim, Muslim, same thing, right? No, two sets of [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5509.759999999999s)]
*  Muslims fighting against each other all the time. Al Qaeda wanted to topple Saddam's government. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5516.639999999999s)]
*  Saddam was a bad guy, but he had absolutely nothing to do with Al Qaeda other than killing them every [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5522.0s)]
*  once in a while, right? So 69% of Americans on the day we went to war in Iraq thought Saddam had [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5526.24s)]
*  personally attacked us on 9-11. That's part of how we got lied into that war. And then, of course, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5533.12s)]
*  there was a story about, my God, Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. We better act before the [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5539.12s)]
*  evidence comes in in the form of a mushroom cloud over an American city. That's what they said to [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5546.0s)]
*  us, right? And now what are they saying about Iran? Iran has nuclear weapons all by the door. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5551.76s)]
*  They're about to. They're about to. Weapons of mass destruction. And Fox News is printing that [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5557.360000000001s)]
*  lie over and over and over again. Gigantic liars, right? Netanyahu, although to be fair, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5561.68s)]
*  the one time he got caught was on Fox News. Super ironically, I'll give Brett Breyer, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5568.56s)]
*  I always give credit where credit is due. And Breyer asked him about it. And Netanyahu said, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5572.64s)]
*  because Breyer said, wait, US intelligence says they don't even have a nuclear weapons program. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5577.04s)]
*  They stopped it back in 2003. They have never reconstituted it. The Grand Atoll is opposed to [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5581.92s)]
*  it. And then Netanyahu goes, yeah, I mean, they could have a weapon within a year. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5588.08s)]
*  What happened to any week now, any day now? And I had to go, right? And of course, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5595.44s)]
*  Netanyahu is a giant liar. And he's been saying that Iran was about to have a nuke since 1995. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5599.92s)]
*  But there were shows on the air that were opposed to the Iraq war and did see through the lies. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5606.64s)]
*  Two of them. One was Democracy Now, national shows. There's local shows too. A couple of those, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5612.0s)]
*  about a handful of those. But national level, there was Democracy Now with Amy Goodman, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5618.96s)]
*  who's a hero for that, and the Young Turks. So we've been around for 23 years, oldest show [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5623.4400000000005s)]
*  in internet history, first YouTube partner ever. And we were on the air. And Ben Mangus and I were [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5629.84s)]
*  at the time going, no, don't go in just like we are today. Don't go in. It's a trap. Don't go in. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5636.4s)]
*  It has nothing to do with us. So some people saw it, but a lot of people got lied to in the war. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5643.679999999999s)]
*  So look, guys, we do see things from time to time before others do. I'll tell you why in a minute. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5648.639999999999s)]
*  But first, I want to give you an example of what I saw apparently a little bit earlier than others. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5654.0s)]
*  So I was on David Pakman's show. We'll run the full clip for you guys. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5659.839999999999s)]
*  And this was before inauguration, so before Trump even got into office. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5662.96s)]
*  And here's what I told David Pakman. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5669.44s)]
*  Look, this is where I think the rubber hits the road. And this is now I'm really out on a limb, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5672.32s)]
*  okay? I think his base is gonna turn on Israel. And so when he goes, yeah, no, I'm gonna give [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5677.2s)]
*  Israel another $30 billion and I'm gonna help them bomb more countries. At some point, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5686.32s)]
*  Maga is gonna go, no, that's enough, brother, man. That's enough. We said America first, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5691.44s)]
*  not Israel first. And so I think they're gonna turn on that. And that's no one, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5695.759999999999s)]
*  the right wing has never turned on Israel. The left wing's really never really turned on Israel. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5701.759999999999s)]
*  No one's allowed to turn on Israel in America. But when you tell the right wing, you're not [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5706.24s)]
*  allowed to do something. Okay, let's see what happens. So again, we'll see. I get that I'm [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5710.879999999999s)]
*  predicting unprecedented things, but I'm doing that based on what I'm actually seeing on the ground. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5718.64s)]
*  And here we are, Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Steve Bannon, Jack Posobiak, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5723.52s)]
*  Mike Cernovich, Candace Owens. List goes on and on. Charlie Kirk says, I love Israel, but [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5730.8s)]
*  I don't know if they should do this. Why does he say that? Because there's a giant uprising [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5736.4800000000005s)]
*  in his own audience. He did a poll of his audience. You wanna see how it turned out? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5739.84s)]
*  Should we go into, should the US government get involved in Israel's war against Iran? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5744.8s)]
*  10%, yes. 90%, no. 90% of Charlie Kirk's audience said no, do not go to war with Iran. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5750.400000000001s)]
*  Right now, Trump is going to war with Iran. So Trump is wrong. So guys, why did I think that [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5762.0s)]
*  was gonna happen when before inauguration, everyone on the left thought it was totally nuts [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5770.4s)]
*  to say that, right? Because I actually talked to them and I listened to them. And I know it's [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5775.44s)]
*  heresy, heresy to talk to the other side, heresy to listen to them and treat them as human beings, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5782.879999999999s)]
*  fellow citizens that we should have a conversation. I know that there's a lot of disagreement, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5789.599999999999s)]
*  and we think they do terrible things and they think we do terrible things. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5795.04s)]
*  But as citizens, as fellow Americans, if we don't talk to one another, we don't listen to one another, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5799.6s)]
*  the guys up top are always gonna win. They're always gonna get us to fight each other. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5805.28s)]
*  So when I went on the right wing shows and I went on independent shows, what I heard, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5808.96s)]
*  not from just the hosts, but from their audience, was this giant clarion call for, [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5812.88s)]
*  we're actually anti-war. We're not lying. We're not kidding. We're anti-war. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5820.8s)]
*  So they're not gonna agree with us on immigration. They're not gonna agree with us on a lot of things, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5828.4s)]
*  but we agree on this. That's why I said it and that's why it's true today. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5833.04s)]
*  Yeah, and speaking of giving credit, words do. I just wanna say this real quick, Cenk. This is why [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5836.88s)]
*  I think you're great. This is what I appreciate about you. I don't know anyone else who really [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5843.44s)]
*  called out the reason that so many Americans supported the invasion of Iraq and it was racism, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5848.16s)]
*  right? I've always believed Americans just couldn't tell the difference between [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5853.36s)]
*  Saudis and Afghans and Iraqis. So they just supported the invasion of someone over in the [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5856.88s)]
*  Middle East as retribution for 9-11. But yeah, it's hard to remember what that time was like [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5861.5199999999995s)]
*  here in the US. But we had been hearing at that time that this is what needed to be done [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5867.36s)]
*  to protect ourselves from foreign threats. Before 9-11, most Americans didn't even realize that we [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5872.639999999999s)]
*  had foreign enemies who hated us so much that they'd want to attack us directly on our own soil. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5877.6s)]
*  So our fear was then weaponized to garner support for that war. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5882.88s)]
*  Now we're seeing a very similar pattern playing out in Israel. Israelis feel like victims. They [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5887.6s)]
*  feel as though their neighbors are all against them and they have been told not just for years, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5893.280000000001s)]
*  but for decades that Iran has nukes and Iran is on the brink of having nukes. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5897.52s)]
*  And Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal because Benjamin Netanyahu wouldn't be able to [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5902.320000000001s)]
*  use that as propaganda against his own people as long as that deal was in place. So the deal was [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5906.88s)]
*  pulled. It was never replaced with anything else. So now the narrative again is Iran has nukes or [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5913.36s)]
*  Iran is about to have nukes. Iran doesn't have any nukes. Israel has nukes and I'll leave it there. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5918.400000000001s)]
*  All right, last thing here, guys, unitedagainstwar.com. Go sign the petition. Anybody who votes yes for [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5923.4400000000005s)]
*  this war, never gonna vote for them again. You vote against them in your own primaries, whether [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5929.52s)]
*  you're a Republican or a Democrat. If we had this rule in place during the Iraq war and we'd done a [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5934.8s)]
*  pledge large enough, then Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the candidate in 2016. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5940.64s)]
*  The whole world could have been different. Could have been Bernie Sanders or could have avoided so [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5944.400000000001s)]
*  many of these wars, right? Make a pledge, whether they're a Democrat or Republican, you're gonna [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5947.92s)]
*  vote for a different person in your own party in the primaries against the warmongers, unitedagainstwar.com. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5951.84s)]
*  And then finally, look, to your point about racism, even Candace Owens, of all people, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5958.64s)]
*  so she's against this war and she had some good comments today and I'm like, okay, that's good, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5964.16s)]
*  and I like that. And then later on, I'm like, no, don't say that, Jesus Christ, right? So there's [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5972.5599999999995s)]
*  still tons of things we disagree with, even within this issue, it happens, right? But she did say [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5976.5599999999995s)]
*  something powerful the other day that really did affect me. She said, I realized that mainstream [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5981.5199999999995s)]
*  media in this country convinced me to be racist against Muslims. They told me that Muslims were [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5987.84s)]
*  all terrorists and savages and all they believed in was violence. And now that I've woken up and [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=5995.92s)]
*  I'm looking around, they've been the ones that have been attacked over and over and over again. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6002.400000000001s)]
*  The Muslims aren't occupying the Israelis, the Israelis are occupying Palestinians and Muslims. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6008.32s)]
*  It's a lot of times Israel doesn't get attacked, Israel does the attacking. We just saw it [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6015.84s)]
*  spectacularly with Iran right now. They did the attacking, they started the war. But American [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6020.8s)]
*  media, my entire life has been telling you, dark Muslims, so they're terrorists. You should be [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6027.12s)]
*  really worried and afraid and fearful and hate and filled with hate towards Muslims. Why do we hate [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6035.76s)]
*  Muslims? Where did that thought even get into the minds of Americans? And who planted that thought [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6042.48s)]
*  there? So look, it doesn't matter what you think about race at the end of the day today. Today, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6048.16s)]
*  what matters is America doesn't need to be in this war. It is not our war and we should not go die [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6056.0s)]
*  there and spend trillions of dollars like we did in Iraq, unitedagainstwar.com. We'll be right back. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6063.759999999999s)]
*  My button is bigger than yours and my button works. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6069.36s)]
*  All right, let's go to super chat. MJSC writes in, what pisses me off is in Iraq war veterans that [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6159.36s)]
*  they won't be sending their kids. Barron will not be going. I have three boys, 20, 18 and 15. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6178.88s)]
*  It'll be my kids dying in this war. So yeah, of course, Barron's gonna find some bone spurs [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6183.92s)]
*  real quick, right? Just like his papa. The autonomous penguin says, so Trump's gonna [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6189.36s)]
*  side with a rogue state that got us into a disastrous Iraq war over his own base. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6194.4800000000005s)]
*  He wrote in Kenny, I don't know if he means that in Yahoo, has been lying to Congress with false [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6200.16s)]
*  intelligence for 30 years. Absolutely shameful. That is true. Urban Sub set right since US [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6204.4800000000005s)]
*  do not need this war for your citizens sake and for the good of the world. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6211.92s)]
*  Fight for America first, TYT from your real ally, Singapore. Interesting. Okay, Singapore [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6215.12s)]
*  weighing in with the anti war vote. I like it. 00083 says, over the last 30 years, we've been had [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6222.24s)]
*  the most incompetent and impatient leadership on the world stage. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6228.4800000000005s)]
*  And now we're back here again, going to war for Israel. Well, guys, I mean, part of what we're [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6231.4400000000005s)]
*  saying here is, what I'm sensing is both from the left and the right, this giant awakening, [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6238.8s)]
*  where we're kind of waking up out of a hypnosis and going, wait, why do we have to do everything [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6246.4800000000005s)]
*  Israel tells us to do? Why is it the most important thing in the world to follow all of their orders [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6252.16s)]
*  and commands? No, it's not. Right, exactly. No, it's not. That's just a lie you were told. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6257.92s)]
*  Land of the free, home of the my ranch, right? So eating Israel in a war, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6264.08s)]
*  it initiates risk dragging the US into a wider conflict, fueling extremist backlash, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6267.68s)]
*  could spark attacks on our soil, just like the blowback that led to 911. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6272.16s)]
*  He writes, continues, let's not forget FBI testimony to Congress 2002 on why Bin Laden [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6276.96s)]
*  attacked on our soil because of US policy in the Middle East. Netanyahu agenda is to destabilize [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6282.240000000001s)]
*  the region for his own greater Israel. Yes, well, for whatever it's worth, I don't know how much [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6288.400000000001s)]
*  it's worth, but Bin Laden's letter did write in, it was because of the Israeli occupation. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6294.96s)]
*  Of course, nobody ever bothered to report on that because you're not allowed to report on [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6299.84s)]
*  things like that. And I don't really care what Bin Laden thinks, but I do care that we not needlessly [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6304.72s)]
*  get dragged into these wars. All right, we'll be right back. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6310.08s)]
*  All right, back on TYT, Cenk and Yaz with you guys. At the top of the hour at eight o'clock [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6324.96s)]
*  Eastern, one of the leading libertarians in the country, Dave Smith, is gonna join us. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6334.64s)]
*  He is definitely also anti-war and now says he regrets his vote for Trump and thinks he [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6338.4s)]
*  should be impeached. We're gonna have that conversation in about 15 minutes. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6344.8s)]
*  Right now, Yaz, what do you have next for us? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6348.8s)]
*  All right, we have Harry Enton. Let's roll the tape. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6350.4s)]
*  You know, I'm really, really surprised when I look at polling data, I look at it every day. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6380.719999999999s)]
*  But the amount of disapproval for this bill, holy cow, my goodness gracious. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6385.36s)]
*  All right, well, despite Trump's attempts to sell his big, beautiful budget bill to the American [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6392.719999999999s)]
*  people, it seems that most Americans actually hate it. So we're gonna hear all about it now [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6397.92s)]
*  from CNN's Harry Enton, and he's always fun. The new KFF survey finds that Americans [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6403.36s)]
*  generally not so in favor of the bill with nearly two-thirds of the American public [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6410.08s)]
*  expressing their disapproval. We're talking about 29 points underwater on the net favorable rating, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6414.32s)]
*  but that matches the Quinnipiac University poll from last week when it was 26 points underwater. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6418.96s)]
*  Oh my god, you need Greg Louganis to get that far underwater. And I mean, we're talking about a [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6425.12s)]
*  negative 41 net favorability rating among independents in the center of the electorate. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6429.6s)]
*  You rarely ever see pieces of legislation or proposed pieces of legislation as unpopular as [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6434.4s)]
*  but here you see it in two polls, 26 points underwater and 29 points underwater, no good. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6440.08s)]
*  No good. So in addition to the KFF poll, another poll published by the Washington Post today [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6447.6s)]
*  shows opposition to the tax and spending legislation and mixed opinions on specific [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6454.08s)]
*  provisions. So you can see here House Republicans budget bill has nearly twice as many opponents as [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6458.88s)]
*  supporters, though many have no opinion. So even among Republicans, you can see [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6464.8s)]
*  barely half of them support the bill. And you'll also notice that 19% of Dems have no opinion on [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6469.84s)]
*  the bill. That number is doubled among Republicans. So I don't know if that means they're just not [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6476.0s)]
*  paying as close attention to what's going on, or maybe the media they consume isn't talking [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6480.320000000001s)]
*  about the bill, or maybe they just don't want to speak out against their party and the administration. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6484.8s)]
*  But let's look at how Americans actually feel about the specific policies in the bill. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6490.0s)]
*  Here are the areas that show a majority of support. So things that Americans like about [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6494.72s)]
*  the budget bill, they support increasing the child tax credits, extending tax cuts for single [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6501.6s)]
*  incomes under 100K and also between 100 and 200K, supporting eliminating taxes on tips, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6507.4400000000005s)]
*  and extending tax cuts. I already said that one, requiring low income childless adults under 65 [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6515.12s)]
*  to prove that they're working or disabled to get Medicaid, extending the 2017 federal tax cuts for [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6522.08s)]
*  everyone, and extending the electric vehicle tax credit. So conversely, here's a look of what they [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6527.6s)]
*  oppose. So the majority opposes repealing some loan forgiveness programs. They oppose increasing [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6535.2s)]
*  military spending by $150 billion. They oppose spending $50 billion on the border wall between [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6541.68s)]
*  the US and Mexico. They oppose ending tax breaks for clean energy and extending tax cuts for [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6548.16s)]
*  corporations and extending tax cuts for single incomes over 400K. And they oppose spending [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6554.08s)]
*  $45 billion on migrant detention centers and reducing federal funding for food assistance [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6560.08s)]
*  programs. So as you can see, some of the most decisive parts of the bill are with regard to [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6566.24s)]
*  the size and scope of cuts to entitlement programs. And an interesting thing that this poll uncovered, [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6571.2s)]
*  which is bad news for Trump, and we sort of alluded to it earlier, is that the more people [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6577.52s)]
*  learn about this bill, the less they like it. So most people are not very aware of the legislation. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6582.080000000001s)]
*  And among those who have heard about the bill, it is unpopular. About two-thirds of the public say [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6588.400000000001s)]
*  they have heard either little or nothing about the bill. Those who have heard a great deal or [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6594.4800000000005s)]
*  a good amount about it oppose it by roughly two to one margin, 64% to 33% with nearly half [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6600.24s)]
*  strongly in opposition. Well, of course, people haven't heard enough about the bill. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6607.28s)]
*  It seems like half of our representatives who voted to pass the bill in the House haven't even [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6612.5599999999995s)]
*  read the bill. So how could the public, especially Republican voters, be expected to be educated on [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6617.36s)]
*  it? Cenk, do you think that we as voters have a responsibility to stay informed on [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6622.88s)]
*  matters like this one? The details and contents of such a huge spending bill, especially when [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6628.32s)]
*  our own representatives are themselves not informed, or is there just nothing we can do [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6634.08s)]
*  about it now since there's no immediately upcoming election? It feels like the representatives who [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6638.639999999999s)]
*  have openly admitted that they had not read the bill before they voted on it, they're just not [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6644.24s)]
*  afraid of any consequences for admitting that much, just the fact that they haven't read it [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6649.2s)]
*  to their constituents. Yeah, so look, independent media is the answer, because all my life, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6654.48s)]
*  mainstream media has been giant liars. They never tell you what the American people actually want. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6660.32s)]
*  They tell you what the elites want and pretend that the American people want it. And this poll [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6665.28s)]
*  shows you exactly what I'm talking about. And I'm gonna give you productive answers as to what we [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6669.44s)]
*  should do in a second as well. But first, as to how badly this poll, this bill is doing right now, [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6674.719999999999s)]
*  guys, 17% of independents approve. If you're a Republican, you can make any excuse you like. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6681.84s)]
*  If you're a MAGA and you love the bill, okay, go ahead. But 17% of independents is a disaster. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6687.4400000000005s)]
*  And we're a fair show. We're not one of these partisan hacks. Our side is great, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6694.4800000000005s)]
*  your side is terrible, right? So no, when Joe Biden was in the low 30s with independents, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6698.88s)]
*  I came on the show in 2023 and said he cannot recover. You can't be this low with independents [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6704.56s)]
*  and win an election. I mean, the age is super relevant. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6711.04s)]
*  But whether it's the age or anything else, the juries come in. You can't be this low with [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6714.4s)]
*  independents. And so that's what I'm telling you, Republicans. Now, it doesn't mean the bill's not [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6718.64s)]
*  gonna pass cuz almost everyone in Congress is a crook. And they can't wait to give themselves [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6722.64s)]
*  tax breaks, right? Let alone deregulation and all the other goodies in here for corporations [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6727.12s)]
*  that are all of their donors. It'll pass. But Republicans, if later [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6731.76s)]
*  the country holds it against you, don't be surprised. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6736.320000000001s)]
*  They told you ahead of time they don't want the damn bill. Now, when you get into the details, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6739.84s)]
*  that shows you exactly what the American people do and don't want, right? So yeah, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6744.240000000001s)]
*  I was ready to, but I just wanna focus on a couple of things here. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6749.92s)]
*  Child tax credits. What do we tell you about Biden? We said, when he put that in for a year [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6753.4400000000005s)]
*  in the beginning of his term for the COVID relief bill, it was the single most popular thing that [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6758.320000000001s)]
*  he did. And when he took it away, that's when his ratings started to decline. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6763.28s)]
*  And we said, my God, no fight for the child tax credit. And progressives in Congress said, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6768.48s)]
*  no, trust Biden. And of course, the corporate Democrats were like, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6772.8s)]
*  we don't really wanna do it. Are you kidding me? Our donors don't want that. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6776.4s)]
*  Anyway, where is it? Look, that's the number one provision in the bill at 72% approval. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6780.0s)]
*  Told you. Why? Cuz it's not complicated. Look at the others, right? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6784.96s)]
*  Ending tax cuts for people making under $100,000, 71%. Eliminating taxes on tips for people who are [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6789.4400000000005s)]
*  middle class and work at 65%. Those are the most popular provisions in the bill. Why? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6795.84s)]
*  Cuz they go to you, obvious. It's so obvious. Isn't it amazing how much mainstream media has [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6802.08s)]
*  brainwashed the American people and lied to you your whole lives? Of course, give people [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6808.08s)]
*  what they want instead of what the elites want. Now, what are the mainstream media [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6812.160000000001s)]
*  always says? People love tax cuts. No, they like tax cuts for people making under $100,000. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6816.32s)]
*  Do they like tax cuts for people making above $500,000 or $400,000? Good news, it's in the poll. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6822.88s)]
*  Let's look, ending tax cuts for single incomes above $400,000. Deeply unpopular at 29% [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6829.36s)]
*  at the bottom. Nobody, and I've told you this 100 times, I wrote it in my book, Justice is Coming. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6838.0s)]
*  76% of the country in almost every poll says raise taxes on the rich. Don't lower them, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6843.92s)]
*  raise taxes. That's three quarters of the country. How many times have you heard that [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6851.04s)]
*  on CNN or even MSNBC? My guess is zero. They're in the top. They all make about $400,000. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6854.4s)]
*  They're lying to you. Okay, so how about the $45 billion for migrant detention centers? [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6863.28s)]
*  MAGA thinks people want migrant detention centers. No, they don't. 24% approval, okay? [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6868.96s)]
*  How about reducing food assistance? Yeah, we're gonna take food away from them so we can give [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6874.96s)]
*  tax cuts to people making above 400,000. People love that. No, they hate it. The single least [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6880.4s)]
*  popular provision in the bill at 23%. Because you know why? The American people are decent human [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6886.32s)]
*  beings. They don't want you to take money and food out of the mouths of hungry children and [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6892.08s)]
*  give it to the richest people in the country. And guys, the tax cut that goes to people making [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6899.92s)]
*  above $500,000 a year is valued at least $1.1 trillion. Cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6905.36s)]
*  $1.1 trillion. They are very literally stealing from the poor and the middle class [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6914.8s)]
*  and giving it to the richest people. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6920.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's why this bill is 29, 26 points underwater, deeply unpopular, only 17% of [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6922.4s)]
*  independents support it. This bill sucks and the American people hate it. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6929.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I just wanna say real quick that Senate Republicans are now scrambling to get [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6934.08s)]
*  this thing passed by the July 4th deadline. So we're in for a very interesting Independence Day. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6939.6s)]
*  But there is some hope that they'll at least amend some things in the bill before it gets [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6946.08s)]
*  passed. There does seem to be some opposition from the Republican side that could stifle its [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6950.48s)]
*  passing. But they're not gonna get rid of those tax cuts. Everything this administration has done [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6955.52s)]
*  this far for the past few months has been in service of these tax cuts. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6961.04s)]
*  Everything we've seen with Trump, everything we've seen with Elon and Doge, it has been to get the [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6965.44s)]
*  rich their tax cuts. And it's a very specific number that they're after. They're not gonna [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6970.16s)]
*  give it up. They're not even gonna budge from that number. So either way, the American people [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6974.56s)]
*  are gonna have to deal with it. And hopefully the Republican Party will have to deal with the [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6978.72s)]
*  consequences of what they've done to the American people come midterms. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6983.280000000001s)]
*  All right, we're gonna take a quick break here. Just a couple of minutes, Dave Smith's gonna join [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6986.320000000001s)]
*  us and we're gonna start a rebellion against the war. We'll be right back. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6990.64s)]
*  Oh my god, you need Greg Louganis to get that far underwater. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=6993.28s)]
*  All right, let's go to Super Chatty on Jerry Olson said, Cenk, relax. We learn about the nuclear [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7023.28s)]
*  bomb through a signal message. We'll probably get a 24 hour heads up. Or at least maybe an Atlantic [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7038.96s)]
*  reporter will, so that's a good joke. Veronica Horst writes in, is there any anti-war party though? [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7044.8s)]
*  Right wing and left wing both seem to love bombing the Middle East. Islamophobia and [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7051.2s)]
*  Russophobia are a huge problem. There are a few wars on both sides. It's depressing. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7056.96s)]
*  So you gotta look for the people that are anti-war within the parties. So right now that [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7061.36s)]
*  is a contingent of one, maybe two in the Republican Party. Tom Massey, good principled man, [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7066.5599999999995s)]
*  disagree with him on a lot of issues, but he's always been anti-war and he's true and he's honest. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7072.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, so that's a very rare in Congress. Marjorie Taylor Greene hasn't joined that [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7080.0s)]
*  War Power Resolutions Act yet of Thomas Massey, but probably will. I wouldn't call her the most [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7085.84s)]
*  honest person in Congress as I would with Massey. Well, the second most honest after Bernie Sanders. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7091.52s)]
*  So they're going in an anti-war direction. We'll see how many of them follow. On the left, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7098.64s)]
*  you've got Bernie Sanders, you got AOC and Ro Khanna is always the leading anti-war guy. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7102.96s)]
*  So there's a solid contingent, Rashida Tlaib and others that are anti-war. So go find people that [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7108.16s)]
*  you believe in policy wise. Policy is much more important than partisanship. All right, let's go [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7114.16s)]
*  to YouTube members. Duna Dayan writes in, I'm so annoyed with our government. How do we not have [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7119.12s)]
*  universal healthcare, paid family leave, and then fund everything for Israel? I wish our politicians [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7123.76s)]
*  had spines and cared about our country. Thank you, TYT. Thank you, brother. ACGC says, [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7128.5599999999995s)]
*  Israel's the bully in the neighborhood that says, why are you punching yourself? [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7134.64s)]
*  But when they get punched, they scream, mommy, he hit me. A hundred percent. And in fact, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7138.4800000000005s)]
*  it's the story I've told members a bunch of times, but one of the last fight I got into in Miami a [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7144.4800000000005s)]
*  long, long time ago, a guy punches me in the face six times. I won't mess up. I finally get him in a [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7149.04s)]
*  headlock and he starts screaming, why are you grabbing me? Why are you grabbing me? Right? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7154.160000000001s)]
*  I'm like, because you punched me in the face six times? I didn't know his name was Israel at the [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7158.8s)]
*  time. Okay, Marco Antonio, be careful about the Uyghur maneuver. Anyways, Marco writes in, Netanyahu [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7162.96s)]
*  is Lucy with a football, America's Charlie Brown falling for it every time. Good analogy. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7170.4s)]
*  Kristi North Dragon Weber says, I'm genuinely struggling not to hate Israel right now. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7175.12s)]
*  The only thing that's keeping me from frothing in the mouth with rage at that place is reminding [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7179.36s)]
*  myself about how I didn't agree with Iraq either. Kristi, look, hate isn't gonna solve it. I get it. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7183.04s)]
*  It's so hard not to be intensely frustrated with Israel and certainly their evil leaders [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7189.2s)]
*  like Netanyahu, Ben Gavir and Smoltrich. But they have had other governments in the past. They've [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7195.04s)]
*  had left-leaning governments in the past. They've had governments that offer peace [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7199.12s)]
*  treaties in the past, right? So we've gotta get them back to some semblance of sanity. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7202.88s)]
*  But hate isn't gonna solve the problem. That I'm positive of, right? Martin Luther King was right. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7208.72s)]
*  Hate can never drive out hate, only love can. Because if you keep hating the other side, [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7212.96s)]
*  you're never gonna get to any kind of peace. Once you begin to identify with each other and [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7217.68s)]
*  empathize with each other, that's when you get the peace. Fernando Gerardo Garcia writes in, [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7221.52s)]
*  stop the war no matter what it takes or who we have to team up with, even Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7226.88s)]
*  I agree, unitedagainstwar.com pledged to never vote for anyone who votes yes for this war. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7231.84s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7236.72s)]
*  Interview with Dave Smith, one of the leading libertarians joining the fight against the war. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7266.72s)]
*  That's coming up next day right here. We'll be right back. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7270.96s)]
*  All right, back on Young Turks. Joining me now, Dave Smith, he's one of the leading libertarians [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7416.72s)]
*  in the country. His show is called Part of the Problem. And he has just said that he is upset [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7442.48s)]
*  that he voted for Donald Trump. So we're gonna talk to him about it. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7451.04s)]
*  And we're gonna see if we can find a mutual answer for the problem of going to war in Iran, [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7454.24s)]
*  which neither one of us wanna do. Dave, welcome back. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7460.24s)]
*  Thank you, Cenk. Thank you so much for having me. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7463.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, no problem. So first, let's talk about whether we should talk. Then we'll talk about [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7465.36s)]
*  what we talked about in the past. And then we'll finally get to how do we end this war? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7472.0s)]
*  Okay, how do we stop this war? So first, we ask our audience, [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7476.32s)]
*  should we form a coalition with the right against the war with Iran? [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7480.0s)]
*  Because a lot of people on the left say no, no, no, the right is verboten. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7483.28s)]
*  Don't ever talk to them, don't have a beer with them, don't do anything with them. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7487.44s)]
*  Young Turks members are totally different. 97% said yes. Okay, so that's a pretty good number. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7492.4s)]
*  So Dave, first, I did a debate with you about Israel. You and I were on the same side. It [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7499.6s)]
*  was against Dennis Prager and Batya Ungar Sargon, right? And let's be honest, we annihilated them, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7508.32s)]
*  right? Okay, and at that time, you're pretty set against Trump. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7514.16s)]
*  What made you vote for Trump in the first place? [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7520.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, there were several factors. I thought, first of all, I should probably make [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7522.8s)]
*  clear that, and this is something that's come up because I've seen the reaction to me saying I [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7529.6s)]
*  regret voting for the guy. I'm a radical libertarian, and I look at voting in a different [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7533.84s)]
*  way than I think a lot of other people do. I don't look at voting as like a full endorsement [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7540.64s)]
*  of somebody in every position that they have. Libertarians, and I believe we're right about [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7547.36s)]
*  this, we view governments inherently as instruments of tyranny and force. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7553.04s)]
*  And that doesn't, by the way, I'm not even saying some libertarians might, or you and I would [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7560.08s)]
*  probably agree that there might be some legitimate functions that could be done by an instrument of [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7564.0s)]
*  tyranny and force. But nonetheless, that is what they are by their very nature. And I think that [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7569.599999999999s)]
*  the people essentially are underdressed by their government. And voting to me is a strategic [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7574.4s)]
*  option. You could, as Walter Block, who's a libertarian economist, he used the example of, [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7582.08s)]
*  if you were in a concentration camp and they gave you a vote over who your guard is gonna be. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7587.839999999999s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that you endorse being in a concentration camp or you endorse everything [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7593.679999999999s)]
*  that this guard is gonna do. You're simply saying, I think this guard is gonna be a little bit more [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7598.879999999999s)]
*  just than that guard is. Now, I supported Donald Trump for several reasons. Number one, I thought [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7603.12s)]
*  that it was very important for the country that the Democrats take a loss. I was very clear on [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7610.48s)]
*  this from the very beginning that I thought this was the most important issue. The Democrats, [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7617.12s)]
*  to me, had just gone so far on so many issues. Even though Republicans were bad, I mean, Democrats [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7622.16s)]
*  were leading the charge on championing lockdowns and vaccine mandates and just the insane COVID [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7629.44s)]
*  hysteria, the insane woke hysteria, which I think was like a neoliberal takeover of the left. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7635.5199999999995s)]
*  And the Democrats were leading the push for that. Then on top of that, there was the war in Ukraine [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7642.08s)]
*  that they went all in on while the Republicans were at least rhetorically substantially better [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7650.0s)]
*  than them on. Then they had a senile president who they lied to the American people and told [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7655.52s)]
*  wasn't senile. Then they tried to, I mean, after denying a primary, after rigging the previous two [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7662.96s)]
*  primaries, they then wouldn't even let you vote on the next substitute candidate. I mean, you know [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7671.6s)]
*  all this stuff, Cenk. So I just thought this was so overwhelming they needed to lose. I thought it [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7677.52s)]
*  was an incredible blow to the corporate media. I think one that they'll never recover from was [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7682.48s)]
*  Donald Trump winning a second time and kind of the podcast scene ushering him in. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7687.839999999999s)]
*  So I thought there were lots of cultural issues and bigger issues for the country. I felt like [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7692.48s)]
*  Donald Trump winning would be better than Kamala Harris winning. And then on top of that, I guess, [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7699.12s)]
*  I reserved a little bit of hope that, hey, things looked a little bit different this time. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7705.44s)]
*  He had Tulsi Gabbard and Bobby Kennedy and a lot of these different figures. Tucker Carlson [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7710.8s)]
*  had some influence on him, who's really great on a lot of the foreign policy issues. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7717.84s)]
*  And Joe Rogan helped get him into the White House. Maybe he could have some influence. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7722.4s)]
*  There was just, it seemed to me that there were more possibilities with Donald Trump for something [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7726.88s)]
*  positive happen. And I would also add he had been burned by the system in a unique way. And I thought [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7733.04s)]
*  maybe he would be a little bit different this time around. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7739.44s)]
*  And also he had been totally betrayed by Netanyahu after that, when Netanyahu came out and [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7742.799999999999s)]
*  congratulated Joe Biden for winning the election before our media was even calling the election [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7748.16s)]
*  for Joe Biden. So anyway, I thought maybe there's a shot he'd be a little bit better. And I thought [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7753.679999999999s)]
*  with all the factors I put in on, I'm gonna support this guy. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7760.16s)]
*  Yeah, so look, there's plenty that I disagree with you on that analysis and there's plenty [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7765.04s)]
*  I agree with you on that analysis. The Democrats did lie to the country. Joe Biden was too old and [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7769.4400000000005s)]
*  it was absurd. Corporate media did lie and corporate media, I love that they were defeated. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7774.64s)]
*  That's why that tweet that people found to be controversial. I was not 1% happy that Donald [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7779.04s)]
*  Trump won. But I said after that he won, we were out of the establishment prison and in the [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7783.84s)]
*  Populous Woods. And I prefer to be in the Populous Woods than in the establishment prison. And that [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7789.04s)]
*  prison was set by corporate media, mainstream media, etc. And so now there's a jailbreak. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7793.92s)]
*  That's why we're in the conversation we are about Iran. They say, of course you have to go to war [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7798.72s)]
*  with Iran. Who do you think you are? No, if Israel commands us to go, you must go, right? But now [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7803.2s)]
*  independent media is saying no, and that's what we're united about. That's what we're gonna get [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7809.52s)]
*  to in a second. But you did mention one thing there that drew my interest super quick, [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7812.56s)]
*  because I really wanna talk about the war. But you said you're a radical libertarian, [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7817.6s)]
*  don't like the militarization, worried about the tyranny of government, etc. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7822.32s)]
*  So are you opposed to the Marines in LA? Well, I mean, no, I think that's a little [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7826.16s)]
*  bit different of a question. And I don't, generally speaking, I don't like the government [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7832.32s)]
*  doing anything. And I don't like our government being so militarized. I've been an opponent of [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7839.5199999999995s)]
*  the militarization of the police for many years at this point. I do think that there is, and look, [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7846.96s)]
*  we could, this could be a whole topic that we talk quite a lot about. But the riots of 2020 [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7855.52s)]
*  and things like that, I simply do not believe should be allowed to happen. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7862.88s)]
*  And I also don't think that they're very organic in nature. I think that there are big, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7867.12s)]
*  there's big business behind a lot of these things and big money behind a lot of these events. And [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7872.0s)]
*  listen, when protests turn violent, I think that they do need to, that does need to be stopped. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7878.0s)]
*  And whatever that takes, I'd prefer it doesn't take the military to do that. But I am not for [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7885.28s)]
*  violence in the street. I'm not for destroying people's property. I mean, I thought it was an [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7893.68s)]
*  absolute outrage in 2020 that we're society, we have this militarized police and all of this stuff. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7898.16s)]
*  And the one time that there might be a legitimate need for it, they just stand down and allow, [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7904.8s)]
*  like dozens of people to be murdered and thousands to be assaulted and billions of dollars in property [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7910.16s)]
*  damage. I mean, I think it's appalling. I also think it's appalling when cops are spraying pepper [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7916.32s)]
*  spray into nonviolent protests and things like that. But I don't have much tolerance for riots. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7921.2s)]
*  Okay, good. So neither do I. I believe in nonviolence. We're gonna talk about that in [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7928.48s)]
*  the context of the war protests in a minute. But good, because otherwise we've established [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7932.4s)]
*  that we really do disagree on other issues, right? I think the Marines in LA is an abomination. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7937.68s)]
*  I think you're totally wrong about that, especially as a libertarian. I think that, [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7943.2s)]
*  as you saw the 22 corporations that sponsored the military parade, [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7948.32s)]
*  our military's gotten corporatized. And so if you're worried about- [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7951.92s)]
*  I'm against the parade. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7955.36s)]
*  Yeah, okay. So the US military in the streets is exactly the tyranny of government that you [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7956.799999999999s)]
*  guys were worried about. But okay, so we disagree on things. Good. Okay, now let's talk about things [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7962.5599999999995s)]
*  we agree on, right? It's called being an American. And I want everybody to know, and these days, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7967.839999999999s)]
*  especially on the left, I love you guys, okay? But Americans are allowed to disagree on different [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7972.16s)]
*  things and agree on others. I know it's a revolutionary thought, but we're doing a [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7977.679999999999s)]
*  revolution here. Okay, so you and I both agree we should not go into Iran. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7982.08s)]
*  But now, because of Donald Trump's actions, you have now flipped on Donald Trump. So [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7988.72s)]
*  you said the other day that you regret voting for Donald Trump. You stick by that, do you regret it? [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=7996.32s)]
*  And you said as far as, you went as far as saying impeached. Do you still believe that today, and why? [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8000.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, look, at this point, look, Cenk, with a lot of these things, [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8007.6s)]
*  it's, what do I have? I don't have any power over actual government policy, but I have a little bit [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8014.96s)]
*  of an audience, and then I have an influence on some people who have audiences. And so I can add [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8022.320000000001s)]
*  a little bit of influence on a broader conversation. And what else can you do when the President of [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8027.120000000001s)]
*  the United States is leading us into the most disastrous policy imaginable, and I'm on record [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8033.92s)]
*  having supported the guy? What can I say other than, yeah, I shouldn't have done that, and this [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8040.4s)]
*  is terrible. And let me try in my little part to rally as many people that I can to give pushback [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8045.04s)]
*  to this. And not due to my influence, but just in a very good turn of events, and because some people [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8053.2s)]
*  have shown real integrity, and also because I think there's a certain desire amongst the people. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8061.92s)]
*  But we've seen a lot of very influential MAGA figures really say that they will not put up [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8066.72s)]
*  with this, and they will not support this. And I think that's something that should be celebrated [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8075.04s)]
*  by everybody who is against the absolute catastrophe that a further escalating war in Iran would be. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8079.52s)]
*  And look, it's not as if Donald Trump doesn't have to run for reelection. He does have midterms [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8088.16s)]
*  coming up, and he does need his coalition to some degree in order to get his agenda through. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8094.8s)]
*  But the only thing that many of us can do at this point is try our best to create a situation where [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8100.639999999999s)]
*  there will be a cost to be paid for him doing this. And so I think that it's been pretty clear. I [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8108.48s)]
*  mean, look, it's pretty remarkable, forget me, but figures like Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8114.48s)]
*  Charlie Kirk are all out there right now saying, you will destroy your coalition if you do this. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8121.04s)]
*  You will absolutely split MAGA into a civil war against each other. And so that is, if you think [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8127.839999999999s)]
*  about it in the game of politics, a huge cost to be imposed on somebody. And so right in this very [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8134.48s)]
*  prescient moment, the fact that that cost is being imposed, I think is a great thing. And if I can [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8142.96s)]
*  play any part in that, then I'm happy to do it. And also, Cenk, as something that I think me and [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8148.08s)]
*  you kind of have in common. I don't know, man, when I get on these shows and I start talking, [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8153.12s)]
*  I'm just going to say what I think is true. And so I didn't even really plan out that I was [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8158.56s)]
*  going to say on breaking points the other day, like I regret supporting him and he should be [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8164.64s)]
*  impeached or whatever. It was just like, I mean, I kind of knew it might happen because [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8168.4s)]
*  that's how I felt. But then I just started talking to Sager and Kristol and that's how I feel. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8172.5599999999995s)]
*  And why should he be impeached and removed? I mean, come on, it's so obvious. I mean, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8178.719999999999s)]
*  he's like essentially saying, and I don't know what the real story is here because there's [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8186.16s)]
*  conflicting reports, but it doesn't matter because he's saying it either way, that he was [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8190.0s)]
*  negotiating with Iran to sucker them, to distract them so Israel could launch a sneak Pearl Harbor [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8194.0s)]
*  attack, a completely illegal, aggressive attack against a sovereign nation. Come on, you're going [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8200.96s)]
*  to impeach somebody over a phone call with Zelensky where he maybe tried to suggest that there should [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8208.48s)]
*  be a quid pro quo, which he never even got and then caved, never even got the investigation on [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8216.24s)]
*  Biden and still sent the weapons package in anyway. That's impeachable. January 6th is [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8222.4s)]
*  impeachable, but leading us into the seventh absolutely disastrous regime change war of choice [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8227.44s)]
*  on behalf of a foreign nation. I mean, I don't know, Jay, I've heard it said before, I don't [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8234.32s)]
*  know who remember who coined the phrase, but an impeachable offense is anything the Congress [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8239.039999999999s)]
*  decides. Well, okay. Well, if our Congress wasn't a bunch of hack, corrupt, blood soaked monsters, [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8243.199999999999s)]
*  this seems like maybe something they should pick. Maybe this should be the thing that you impeach [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8250.48s)]
*  a president over. Yeah. Worse than having an affair and lying about it, that's for sure. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8254.0s)]
*  Yeah, unquestionable about that. So let's see if we can unite the country against this war. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8260.72s)]
*  So we're starting with progressives and libertarians here, right? So, Dave, I came up with an idea, [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8265.76s)]
*  I'm going to run it by you. You're the first person I'm running it by. Let's see if we can [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8273.68s)]
*  get agreement on it and see what we can do going forward, right? The idea is called [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8276.88s)]
*  Operation Consequences. And so the first step was going to be having us pick champions for [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8281.679999999998s)]
*  our side and have them introduce the War Power Resolution Act, right? [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8289.119999999999s)]
*  And good news, since they're our champions, they already did it without us asking, okay? [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8294.4s)]
*  Yeah. So my guess is you would have picked Thomas Massey. I would have picked Bernie Sanders, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8299.199999999999s)]
*  and Thomas Massey and Bernie Sanders have introduced legislation to bring the power of [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8303.44s)]
*  war back to Congress, which is where the Constitution has, right? So let's get back [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8308.560000000001s)]
*  to our constitutional system. Let's get back to war. So step one's already done, [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8314.0s)]
*  because that's what champions are made of, right? So, okay, step two is a pledge that if anybody [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8317.92s)]
*  votes yes on this resolution, that we never vote for them again, ever, ever, ever, okay? [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8326.0s)]
*  You can tell me you're great on every other issue, and I can really like you, but you vote yes on [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8334.96s)]
*  this war, and we're done with you forever. What do you think? 100%, yes. Okay, so we set up a site, [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8339.68s)]
*  it's like, it just directs back to a pledge. We're going to do more and more as we go along, [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8347.28s)]
*  but the pledge is to never vote for anyone who voted yes on this war. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8352.4s)]
*  And it's called unitedagainstwar.com, and we'll have the link down below, unitedagainstwar.com, [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8356.16s)]
*  okay? So now, here's the reason to do a pledge. If it turns out, Dave, that it's just me and you, [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8361.199999999999s)]
*  and we ask, our audience, you ask your audience, I'm part of the problem. We both talk about it [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8368.72s)]
*  in all the shows we go on, but we just can't get to like a million people that sign the pledge. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8372.88s)]
*  People aren't going to take it seriously, 12,000 people. That's nice, but it's not going to work, [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8378.24s)]
*  right? And maybe, Dave, what we wind up doing is Al Capone's vault here. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8382.08s)]
*  Remember, Geraldo made a big deal about it, hyped it up, and then it turns out there wasn't [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8387.2s)]
*  anything in it, right? But if you get to a million or 2 million voters who say they will never vote [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8391.36s)]
*  for someone who votes for this war, or you get to 5 million, now all of a sudden a little bit of [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8398.0s)]
*  concern starts to creep in. And mainstream media starts to go, who are these rabble rousers? [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8404.4s)]
*  And how dare they be against this war? So now I'm gonna get to the next steps in a second, but [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8410.24s)]
*  a mass of people promising like a new voting block, totally divorced from the parties. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8418.0s)]
*  And this is really important. Dave, what I'm saying is do it in your primaries, [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8424.0s)]
*  so nobody's doing unilateral surrender to the other side, right? So if a Democrat votes for [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8428.56s)]
*  this war, you must go vote in a primary against them, right? And if a Republican votes for this [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8433.28s)]
*  war, same thing, go in a Republican primary and vote against them, does that part make sense? [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8438.8s)]
*  Sure, absolutely. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8442.4s)]
*  Yeah, so now the most important part is the actual accountability, right? And that has two phases. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8445.199999999999s)]
*  So first part of the accountability is I hope we get volunteers, we do Operation HOPE, [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8455.039999999999s)]
*  tyt.com slash hope, but you can volunteer in any way, shape, or form, or you don't have to [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8460.64s)]
*  volunteer, you can just do it on your own, right? Find your local congressman, find your senator, [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8464.0s)]
*  and just ask them, right? You'd be shocked at how easy it is. Just Google it, find out who they are, [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8468.24s)]
*  email or phone, and ask them, are you in favor of the war powers resolution? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8473.76s)]
*  And Dave, what's great about this resolution is the president can't veto it. It's a congressional [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8479.039999999999s)]
*  power in the Constitution, right? And they must vote on it in 15 days. So it sits in committee [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8484.72s)]
*  usually for 15 days, and it's a privileged bill. So it's gonna get a vote, and everyone's gonna [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8492.16s)]
*  go on the record. That is why pressuring people to, and basically what you're doing, Dave, is [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8498.0s)]
*  a public service announcement to your members of Congress, to your representatives. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8506.72s)]
*  Hey guys, just know that if you vote yes, we're gonna vote against you the rest of our lives. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8512.56s)]
*  I'm just letting you know, you can do whatever you want with that information. I know you're [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8516.96s)]
*  gonna get a check. I know you're gonna get a check from APAC to vote yes, right? But it's gonna cost [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8520.4s)]
*  you this number of votes. Again, does that seem logical to you? [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8525.36s)]
*  Yeah, of course. All of this is the most obvious and logical stuff. I'm thrilled that you're putting [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8529.76s)]
*  it together like this. All right, unitedagainstwar.com. So finally, the last part is the part where, [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8536.560000000001s)]
*  and I'm asking you like genuinely, what do we think? Is it gonna happen? Are people gonna rise up? [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8543.36s)]
*  Or are they gonna go back to tribalism? And they're just gonna go, well, no, I mean, I don't wanna say [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8549.76s)]
*  no because of Trump and because my party, but the Democrats leadership says we should vote yes, [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8554.8s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. Or are there gonna be real consequences? Are the American people gonna [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8561.599999999999s)]
*  rise up enough that we cost them a bunch of seats and totally not related to anything partisan? [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8567.519999999999s)]
*  No, this is just a voting block on a single issue. It's direct democracy. You vote this way, [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8574.72s)]
*  and you're done. What do you think? Does it have a prayer of working? [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8580.96s)]
*  All right, so this is interesting. And I always wanna be a little bit humble when I'm predicting [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8586.96s)]
*  what's gonna happen next. Because predicting the future is always a tough business. And [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8593.759999999998s)]
*  sometimes things will be so obvious that you could predict. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8600.96s)]
*  It was like, hey, if you shut down the economy and print $6 trillion, that's gonna have some [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8604.88s)]
*  negative impacts on the economy. Okay, there's some things you can predict, but there's some [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8609.2s)]
*  things that are tougher. And there's a lot going on here, and we don't know everything. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8614.08s)]
*  I'll say this. The Hawks right now are celebrating the success of this war five days into it. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8618.880000000001s)]
*  That's always the case. They always celebrate it right away. Every single war of my lifetime, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8632.480000000001s)]
*  they're bragging about it as soon as it starts. It's not till it goes bad that they start admitting [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8637.2s)]
*  the truth, if they ever do. Maybe there is some chance. I've heard it argued that Iran is a better [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8641.28s)]
*  candidate for regime change than Iraq or Libya or Syria or Yemen or any of these other regime [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8651.52s)]
*  change arenas of Afghanistan that we've seen in the last 25 years. Maybe there is some sliver of [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8657.76s)]
*  a chance that the regime gets overthrown and it's not the catastrophe that it was in all of these [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8666.16s)]
*  other areas. I find this to be very hard to believe, but just with the caveat that maybe [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8673.36s)]
*  there's some chance that it goes that way. It seems much, much, much more likely that it's [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8678.32s)]
*  gonna be exactly what the other six countries in Wesley Clark's seven countries in five years [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8684.32s)]
*  turned out being and this will be the seventh catastrophe. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8690.16s)]
*  I think at this point, they're in a regime change war. And I don't know, I think it's worth trying [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8693.92s)]
*  to stop it. It's worth trying to impose as big a cost on the politicians in charge if they actually [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8701.28s)]
*  do go through with this. But it seems like they've already launched a regime change war. As me and you [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8708.4s)]
*  both know Cenk, this was never about a nuclear threat from Iran. Iran does not have nuclear [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8713.2s)]
*  weapons. Iran is not trying to get nuclear weapons. Iran has a latent deterrent essentially. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8718.16s)]
*  They wanna just let you know that they could enrich up to a high enough level to have nuclear [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8725.68s)]
*  weapons so you don't do what's already happened to them. Everybody involved knows that, [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8731.36s)]
*  including Netanyahu who's lying through his teeth about that. He doesn't really think Iran's been [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8737.28s)]
*  three years away from a bomb for 30 years. You know what I mean? He knows. And so they're in [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8742.08s)]
*  a regime change war. This has been their goal the whole time. Donald Trump has signed off on it. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8747.36s)]
*  He's backing it up. The question now is, if that is the case and they go through with it, [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8751.76s)]
*  okay, there's a couple major questions. Number one is, what can Iran actually get off? [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8760.640000000001s)]
*  And I don't know that that's completely clear. I know that back in 2007, 2008, even the Pentagon [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8765.28s)]
*  was saying we can't go to war with Iran because they can touch all of our bases and all of our [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8771.12s)]
*  embassies. They can touch Israel. They can really inflict real damage. This isn't like the other [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8775.28s)]
*  puny countries we were picking on in the terror wars. Maybe things have changed a little bit [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8779.76s)]
*  since then. Maybe the technology and that certainly Israel's drone strike there was something they [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8784.0s)]
*  couldn't have pulled off years ago. But I think the real question to get at the heart of what [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8788.400000000001s)]
*  you're talking about here is, 9-11 happened in September of 2001. We invaded Iraq in 2003. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8792.320000000002s)]
*  They spent all of 2002 laying out this propaganda, this cover that was somewhat [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8802.16s)]
*  believable in the wake of 9-11. It was like, hey, 9-11 just happened. There's this rogue Arab [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8809.2s)]
*  regime that was in on 9-11 and is friends with the terrorists and he's developing nuclear weapons [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8817.44s)]
*  or has nuclear weapons and he's gonna hand them off to the terrorists and then they're gonna [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8824.48s)]
*  Al Qaeda is gonna nuke Kansas because Saddam Hussein gave him the, okay, now look, [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8828.8s)]
*  obviously it was all bullshit and, sorry, obviously none of it was true. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8833.68s)]
*  And these were not Saddam Hussein's friends and he didn't have the weapons, but at least there was [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8837.84s)]
*  a cover story there. Here there is no cover story. This is just clearly Israel's war. And also they [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8844.96s)]
*  don't have control of the media in the way they used to. They don't have control of the narrative [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8853.119999999999s)]
*  and so with guys like me and you and hundreds more like us who are all gonna be telling the [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8858.0s)]
*  truth about this to pretty big audiences, I don't see how all of that works. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8864.4s)]
*  And if we really are entering this phase, we're entering a new phase in America. As much as we [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8871.6s)]
*  were in March of 2020, maybe even more so, this dynamic cannot stand. They can't have all of us [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8877.12s)]
*  telling the truth while they haven't even laid out a propaganda campaign if they're launching [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8884.8s)]
*  another regime change war. It just simply can't work. I don't know if they're gonna try to [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8890.08s)]
*  silence us, if they're really gonna weaponize the law against us, or if they're just gonna fail at [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8895.359999999999s)]
*  their mission or there'll be a revolt. I don't know what the answer is, but I'm telling you, [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8901.359999999999s)]
*  with all these facts on the ground, this doesn't work. And so we will see. We're in a whole new [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8905.039999999999s)]
*  time right now. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe cooler heads will prevail here, maybe they will go back [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8912.32s)]
*  to the negotiating table, but I gotta tell you, Cenk, I don't think so. I mean, every signal [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8917.6s)]
*  is that this regime change is going through. And so again, I support doing everything we can to [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8923.279999999999s)]
*  stop it, but I don't know what happens in the next chapter of this. But it's gonna be interesting. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8928.8s)]
*  So let's talk about the upsides that you mentioned and the downsides. So is it true that it's a regime [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8933.6s)]
*  change war? Absolutely, and notice how quickly they move the goalposts, right? Because they [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8938.96s)]
*  started with weapons of mass destruction. They're about to have nukes. Then instantly, [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8943.759999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu goes on Fox News, Brett Baier asked them about it. They weren't gonna get it for a whole [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8949.759999999998s)]
*  year anyway. Okay, and I'm gonna play you a Netanyahu clip if you haven't seen it yet, [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8953.359999999999s)]
*  Daily Show put it together, I love it. To show you what a giant, giant liar he is. But I don't want [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8958.16s)]
*  people to lose focus. I think what Dave was saying about independent media, well, we're gonna test [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8964.16s)]
*  it. This is the beginning. This is the very first day of us testing the power of independent media. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8968.72s)]
*  Okay, so I wanna come back and talk about that in a second. But I wanna bring up that Netanyahu clip [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8973.76s)]
*  because in case you didn't see it on the Young Turks show today, we're normally live 6 to 8 [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8978.08s)]
*  PM Eastern. Then we do interviews like this with David, 8 o'clock and other folks, right? [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8982.48s)]
*  And so we played it for you guys, but I wanna play it here. Because if you're new to this, [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8986.72s)]
*  understand how much, let's be honest, the government of Israel overall, and specifically [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8991.92s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, has been lying to Americans for the last 33 years, watch. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=8996.64s)]
*  Arsenal of nuclear bombs. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9026.64s)]
*  They're very close. They're six months away from being about 90% of having the rich uranium for [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9028.32s)]
*  an atom bomb. Iran is gearing up to have to produce 25 bombs, atomic bombs a year, [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9032.96s)]
*  250 bombs in a decade. Ladies and gentlemen, time is running out. Iran will be capable [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9039.039999999999s)]
*  of producing alone without importing anything, nuclear bombs within three to five years. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9046.0s)]
*  Okay, so I'm gonna get back to how we're gonna fix this. But in the 2006 clip, [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9050.8s)]
*  he said that they could produce 250 nuclear warheads in a decade. It's been basically two [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9059.92s)]
*  decades since then. So do they have 500 nuclear warheads? And Dave, the question I wanna ask you, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9066.16s)]
*  I know, look, this is a layup, but really, I've lost every ounce of respect for mainstream media. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9072.64s)]
*  How do you look at a clip like that and then quote Netanyahu as if he might be telling the truth [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9079.84s)]
*  the very next day in your broadcast? So what are they supposed to, like me, I would say, [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9085.6s)]
*  Netanyahu is a giant liar and no one should ever trust a word that comes out of his mouth. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9093.6s)]
*  But mainstream media reporters will say, no, no, no, no, no. Not only beloved Israel and you have [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9098.960000000001s)]
*  to believe him more than the terrorist Muslims, right? But at a bare minimum, they'll say 50-50. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9104.56s)]
*  But Dave, it's not 50-50, is it? He's been trying to drag us into this war for 33 straight years. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9111.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why this is just reminding me of this, but so I did a debate at Princeton [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9117.279999999999s)]
*  University against Josh Hammer, who is a senior editor at Newsweek. And it was an Oxford-style [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9125.68s)]
*  debate and I smoked him, but that's neither here nor there. But he, at one point, this was his big [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9135.76s)]
*  moment in the debate, is he turned over to me in the question and answer segment and he goes, [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9143.44s)]
*  hey, Dave, who do you trust more, Osama bin Laden or Benjamin Netanyahu? [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9147.52s)]
*  And I responded by saying, I don't trust either of them. And he was like, I think that speaks volumes. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9154.720000000001s)]
*  It was something so messed up that I was like, I don't trust either of those guys. But it's so [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9162.640000000001s)]
*  funny because it's like, you look at this and you're like, yeah, you trust this guy? He's clearly, [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9167.2s)]
*  I'm sorry, this is not somebody getting it wrong. This is somebody lying through their teeth. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9174.0s)]
*  He knows that Iran doesn't have nuclear weapons. You think he thought in the 90s that they were [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9180.16s)]
*  going to develop hundreds of nuclear warheads? It's so ridiculous. And so the thing is that, [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9186.56s)]
*  and of course, Cenk, you know, because you've been in this position so many times, I've seen [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9192.64s)]
*  you there. Well, they'll go, so what are you saying? You support Hamas or you support Iran [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9196.48s)]
*  or you support whoever? And it's like, look, I'm not saying the thing isn't that like I trust [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9200.56s)]
*  Osama bin Laden more than Netanyahu because I think he's like a good person or something like [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9206.08s)]
*  that. It's just that Osama bin Laden is a fanatic who declared war against the American Empire. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9212.4s)]
*  He has no incentive to lie about that. He's telling you, like if you look out your window [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9220.0s)]
*  at night and you see a guy with a bloody knife and he's like, I'm going to come in there and [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9227.12s)]
*  kill you, you're going to take him at his word. I think that is what he's trying to do. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9231.76s)]
*  I'm not going to go, I don't, but Netanyahu is a politician who's trying to lure the US government [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9236.800000000001s)]
*  into war after war after war. So obviously he's incentivized to just lie and lie and lie. And [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9243.44s)]
*  you know, to your point, it's not just that he should be treated as a liar. I mean, he should [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9250.480000000001s)]
*  be treated by the media and the entire US government as a hostile foreign combatant. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9254.16s)]
*  I mean, he is a representative of a foreign government trying to lie. It's not just that [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9260.4s)]
*  he's lying to people. He's trying to lie the American war machine into another war. This is [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9266.72s)]
*  like a crime against humanity and a crime against our country. It is absolutely just like the idea [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9273.119999999999s)]
*  that you could have that track record. Look here, even in American domestic politics, [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9281.36s)]
*  they don't, okay, there are some fringe. And when I say fringe, I mean, in terms of like [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9287.68s)]
*  who's the most consequential figures, there are Lindsey Grahams and some people like this. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9292.560000000001s)]
*  But they know that they can't have Dick Cheney selling the next war because we're like, no, [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9298.480000000001s)]
*  you got to go away forever. But yet Benjamin Netanyahu, who is Dick Cheney of Israel, [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9304.16s)]
*  can still come and get rounds of applause in Congress and get a warm reception in corporate [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9310.48s)]
*  media. Yes, Cenk, I mean, that's a long way to answer your question to say, yes, anybody who's [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9315.199999999999s)]
*  giving this guy a warm welcome at this point and not treating him like an enemy of our nation [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9320.32s)]
*  that he is, should those people are disqualified from you ever giving them an ounce of trust or [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9326.32s)]
*  credibility again. Yeah, I would say that Netanyahu's lies against us is a crime against [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9333.439999999999s)]
*  America, right? And he's committed that crime now for 33 years straight, trying to hoodwink [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9340.24s)]
*  us into the Iraq war. He was one of the top neocons, now trying to hoodwink us into the [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9349.039999999999s)]
*  Iran war and it's despicable no matter which country does it. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9355.36s)]
*  Okay, and then just like in Iraq, as I was saying, they start with WMD and then they go, [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9358.8s)]
*  just kidding, regime change. And exactly what they did here, within just a couple of days [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9363.76s)]
*  after the war starts, they're like, forget their nuclear facilities and the WMD, we're just kidding. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9369.44s)]
*  Now, no, it's regime change. We have to kill the Ayatollah, we have to get rid of their [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9374.960000000001s)]
*  government. But wait, you can kill the Ayatollah, but to your point earlier, David, they can just [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9378.560000000001s)]
*  replace him with another mullah. And if they do that, then they're gonna say, we're gonna kill [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9383.12s)]
*  the next mullah and then we gotta kill the next mullah. You know what, this isn't working, we gotta [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9386.800000000001s)]
*  get on the ground. We're gonna send a ground troops, right? Well, of course, and right, right. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9390.16s)]
*  And look, what's crazy is that you do see a lot of the same people who were selling the war in Iraq [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9395.36s)]
*  and Afghanistan and Libya and Syria and Somalia and Yemen and all of this. You see them still [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9400.800000000001s)]
*  trying to sell this one. And even, look, they'll tell you these things, they're trying to make it [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9406.800000000001s)]
*  sound very nice. Look, the people hate the government, the people are celebrating. By the [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9411.44s)]
*  way, they could find videos in Iraq and in Libya where people were celebrating. Yeah, a lot of [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9415.76s)]
*  people do hate that government. That's not a guarantee of what's gonna happen once that [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9421.12s)]
*  government falls. That doesn't mean- It's absurd. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9424.960000000001s)]
*  That some type of like, yeah, some type of like, liberalism is gonna flourish or something like [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9426.960000000001s)]
*  that. And so it's easy for them to say, the fact of the matter is that the Iranian regime, the mullahs [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9432.880000000001s)]
*  have been in power since 1979. And for most of that time, they've had the most powerful [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9442.800000000001s)]
*  governments in the world hell bent on overthrowing them and have still survived. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9450.32s)]
*  So the idea that this is just gonna be easy to get rid of them or that the people hate them so [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9457.44s)]
*  much that they will overthrow them. I think there's some reason to be skeptical about some of those [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9462.32s)]
*  claims. And it's easy for these guys to celebrate at first. They always do that. And these things, [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9468.4s)]
*  they always celebrate at first and it always leads to absolute disaster. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9477.28s)]
*  Yeah, and so look, to your point, there's a lot of people in Turkey that are very dissatisfied [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9481.36s)]
*  with the current Turkish government. If we start bombing Turkey, they'll fight us for 500 years [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9487.68s)]
*  straight. That's right. And I should just say to your point, I'm sorry to cut you off, but to your [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9492.320000000002s)]
*  point about the moving justifications for this war, I mean, it's just unbelievable. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9498.0s)]
*  I, you're right to cite the parallel between that and like the war in Iraq and the war in [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9503.199999999999s)]
*  Afghanistan and all this stuff. They always move the goalposts in all these wars. We're going into [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9509.439999999999s)]
*  Iraq for weapons of mass destruction, but then it was to liberate the people. And then we're going [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9515.279999999999s)]
*  into Afghanistan to take out Al Qaeda, but then it was to overthrow the Taliban and then it was to [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9521.76s)]
*  nation build. But this one is, it's so quick. They're already, I was arguing with Dinesh D'Souza [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9527.76s)]
*  on Twitter today and he's like, look, I supported the war in Iraq and I was wrong to support that. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9534.64s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, but you're doing the exact same thing right now. And then he goes, well, [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9539.76s)]
*  this isn't the same as Iraq. I mean, they said Saddam Hussein was in on 9-11, but Iran was in [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9543.2s)]
*  on October 7th. And I was like, dude, first of all, no, they weren't. There's no evidence, [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9551.2s)]
*  but this is exactly the same. Second of all, that's not even the justification yet, dude. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9558.08s)]
*  You're jumping to the next justification already. I thought it was that they had nuclear weapons or [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9562.720000000001s)]
*  were developing nuclear weapons. I've already seen several people arguing that it's about [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9567.28s)]
*  freeing the women. They don't give their women rights. And so that's what it's about. They'll [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9573.28s)]
*  just switch. Once one justification falls apart, they have to have the next one to move to. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9578.64s)]
*  And just for any of these, first of all, nobody has presented any evidence. And in fact, there's [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9583.519999999999s)]
*  been evidence to the counter. The US intelligence said that the Iranians were surprised by October [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9591.519999999999s)]
*  7th. Now you could argue that they have sold weapons to Hamas at one point in the past. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9597.92s)]
*  Or in fact, I think they have. I don't exactly know how much weapons they've sold to Hamas. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9604.24s)]
*  They've certainly sold weapons to Hezbollah and to the Houthis. But regardless, is that the [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9608.32s)]
*  standard now, Cenk? That if you sell weapons to someone and they attack you, you're guilty of the [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9614.24s)]
*  attack? Because by the way, if that's the standard, you don't want to go through what the US and Israel [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9619.92s)]
*  are guilty of. You know what I mean? We've sold weapons to half the goddamn country, the world, [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9624.72s)]
*  excuse me. And so that justification completely falls apart. But I will say, especially just [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9630.64s)]
*  because I'm on the Young Turks, I guess, that I think it is when they say the stuff about the [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9636.96s)]
*  feminist stuff, I think that is to try to get the liberals and leftists on like, hey, come on, [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9641.839999999998s)]
*  look at how oppressive this regime is to their women. I mean, you believe in women's rights and [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9647.759999999998s)]
*  all this stuff. And look, there's no question that the regime in Iran is repressive to women, [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9652.64s)]
*  okay? There's no question that Saddam Hussein was repressive to his people. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9659.199999999999s)]
*  And Muammar Gaddafi was repressive to his people. But the worst thing that ever happened to the [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9663.6s)]
*  people, including the women of Iraq, was George W. Bush launching a war there. And the worst thing [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9668.880000000001s)]
*  that ever happened to the people, including the women in Libya, was Barack Obama and Hillary [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9675.52s)]
*  Clinton launching a war there. And so, it's like, you could sit here and tell me the story about [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9681.28s)]
*  how this government's unfair to its people and that we're gonna go in there and overthrow them [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9686.32s)]
*  on behalf of them. But every time you do it, it ends up being the biggest nightmare for those very [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9689.84s)]
*  people that you're pretending to care about. Yeah, I mean, reject all of that stuff. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9694.4s)]
*  Yeah, Israel and neocons here in America as well are all saying, you're right, too. We're going to [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9701.84s)]
*  liberate the women there. Really? Because Israel liberated 20,000 women in Gaza of their lives. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9708.08s)]
*  Right, right. Right, or they care so much about women, [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9714.880000000001s)]
*  except all the women they murdered in Gaza. So now you'll excuse me if I don't buy that [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9718.08s)]
*  load of BS. Okay, so now back to the solution. One more thing here at least, well, actually two [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9724.08s)]
*  things. So look, the way that I see this, Dave, is it's the powerful against the rest of us, [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9728.72s)]
*  right? There's a poll out today, only 16% of Americans think the US should be involved [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9736.96s)]
*  in this war with Iran, 16%. So that is a radical position, right? You're in a tiny, tiny minority [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9743.6s)]
*  if you think we should go to war in Iran. Okay, now you have tons of independent media, [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9751.36s)]
*  if not most of independent media, online media, podcasts, etc., saying don't go. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9756.16s)]
*  This is crazy, right? Including a lot of the right-wing media. So, but mainstream media, [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9760.56s)]
*  cheerleading. Got the pom poms out, we got the outfits back, and they're doing calisthenics, [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9767.759999999998s)]
*  getting ready for war, war, war, W-A-W-A-W, okay, A-R, you get it. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9774.72s)]
*  Lindsey Graham is back out there going, war, we need more war, right? And all the politicians, [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9781.199999999999s)]
*  what I think 87% of Congress at least takes money from AIPAC. So they're all like, war, war, war. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9788.0s)]
*  So they're in the radical 16%. I think most of that 16%, honestly, are people who got brainwashed [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9794.32s)]
*  watching cable news, cuz cable news loves war, right? So we all are kind of despondent [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9799.199999999999s)]
*  because we think there's no way the 84% can beat the 16%, cuz the 16% have all the power. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9807.6s)]
*  But to your point earlier, Dave, I think it's a different day in America. I think that mainstream [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9816.16s)]
*  media has lost a lot of power. I think the reason that the number is at 16% [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9822.88s)]
*  is because people aren't watching the propaganda on cable news anymore. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9828.0s)]
*  And so they might find this a harder hill than they thought it was because of independent media. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9832.16s)]
*  So is there hope here that independent media can start the prairie fire of hope that we can [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9840.32s)]
*  actually defeat the powerful? And that if enough of us band together left, right and center, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9849.28s)]
*  and we say, hey, look, maybe you win, maybe you win your elections. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9855.28s)]
*  But millions of us are going to vote against you. So just don't be surprised when we do. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9860.320000000002s)]
*  I don't want Jake Tapper writing a book later saying no one could have seen it coming [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9868.480000000001s)]
*  because we are gonna come for you. And so if we, you and I do a tour and we go do it and we [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9872.48s)]
*  start to bring in right wing allies if they exist, left wing allies, if they, I know left [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9881.119999999999s)]
*  wing allies exist, whether they'll join in with the right wing is a different question, right? [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9886.8s)]
*  But can we muster up enough momentum here for the 84% to win rather than the 16%? [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9892.08s)]
*  Well, okay, so let me just say a couple, two things to that. Okay, number one, because I've watched you [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9899.039999999999s)]
*  kind of, I think you've probably become the most prominent figure in the country who's really been [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9906.8s)]
*  kind of launching, even before your very specific kind of targeted plan today. But you've been [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9912.48s)]
*  really promoting the idea that we ought a coalition on this opposition to war. And that it's too crazy [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9918.0s)]
*  for us to say that like, oh, he's an evil right winger, or he's an evil left winger. And like, [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9924.8s)]
*  this is just, and I just completely agree with you on that. And I'm a child of the Ron Paul [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9929.119999999999s)]
*  revolution, as we like to call it back then. And that was always his stance, like coalition with [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9937.759999999998s)]
*  anybody who you agree on an issue. Now, look, I will admit that probably in general, when it comes [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9944.48s)]
*  to coalitioning, there's like, you know, everything's within reason. Okay, and like, [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9951.84s)]
*  I probably would not coalition with Lindsey Graham about like, lowering top marginal income [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9957.12s)]
*  tax rates, even though we might agree on that issue. Like, I'm not going to coalition with [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9964.48s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, because my agreements with him are so much more important, excuse me, [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9968.880000000001s)]
*  my disagreements with him are so much more important than this tiny agreement with him [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9974.72s)]
*  that I just wouldn't do that. And he's so monstrous for the things that I don't like about him. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9978.64s)]
*  But this is an issue, and I will say that I think particularly on the left, you do have this issue. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9983.359999999999s)]
*  And part of this is, again, this is, it's not, I'm not saying that there's not this issue on the [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9990.08s)]
*  right at all, or that everyone on the left has it. I just think it's more of an issue on the left. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=9996.24s)]
*  And part of this is because, culturally speaking, the right has gotten beat up for many, many years. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10000.88s)]
*  Though right is more happy to just have anybody on their side about any issue. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10009.519999999999s)]
*  The left has had this major problem, and I think it's something that you've talked about it, [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10015.76s)]
*  you and Anna, I've heard you kind of like discuss this in the past, that over kind of like the last [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10020.88s)]
*  15 years, the left was almost lured into this kind of like cultural space, where there was an [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10026.96s)]
*  inability to prioritize certain issues above other issues, or ever have a hierarchy of outrages, [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10036.72s)]
*  or say that like, look, this thing, while it's a little bit wrong, it's really not that important. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10046.32s)]
*  It's just not nearly as important as this. And I watched this for years, it really saddened me [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10050.64s)]
*  as somebody who's from the left. And when I say from the left, I mean like in my soul, [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10055.84s)]
*  I'm from New York City, I'm a Jewish kid of a single mom. By my nature, I'm not from a [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10061.2s)]
*  conservative background, these people are my people. And I watched this happen, it was very [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10069.2s)]
*  saddening to me. But you would see where during Black Lives Matter protests, there'd be talk about [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10076.720000000001s)]
*  some cop who had killed an innocent person and wasn't held accountable. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10084.960000000001s)]
*  And then there would be an equal amount of weight given to like Aunt Jemima being removed [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10090.16s)]
*  from something. And you're like, guys, guys, guys, come on, priorities, priorities. And you [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10095.28s)]
*  watched as like Obama would drop like a drone bomb on a wedding in Yemen. And then people on the left [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10099.36s)]
*  would be talking about microaggressions and safe spaces. And you're like, guys, what are we doing [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10106.72s)]
*  here? This is just not nearly as important. Even if you think this is a thing, it's not as important [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10112.24s)]
*  of a thing. And so anyway, I guess I'm just going a long way to say that what you're always weighing, [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10118.56s)]
*  whether you're willing to coalition with somebody, is like how important is the thing that you're [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10124.88s)]
*  coalitioning about? How important is it? Are we talking about a goddamn genocide? Well, then yeah, [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10130.08s)]
*  you coalition with anybody, anybody who's willing to coalition with you for that. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10136.8s)]
*  Because who are you? Who are you to ever turn anyone away who's gonna support you ending a [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10141.6s)]
*  genocide? I mean, if we were living in 1840 and we were a couple of abolitionists, me and you, [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10146.56s)]
*  Cenk, would we say, well, I don't know, I mean, me and you disagree on taxes. Me and you disagree [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10152.88s)]
*  on monetary policy, so we can't coalition together against slavery. Or would we say, dude, at this [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10158.88s)]
*  point, there's no other issue. There is no other issue. We're abolitionists, we're against slavery. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10164.88s)]
*  That's it. It doesn't even matter what else we disagree with. This is the issue of our time. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10170.64s)]
*  And what are we talking about here, man? I mean, we're talking about like add them all up, [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10175.76s)]
*  add up the terror wars and add in Israel's destruction of Gaza to it too. What are we [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10180.0s)]
*  talking about? We have millions of people who have been slaughtered and trillions of dollars that [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10184.64s)]
*  have been wasted. It's the most important issue of our time by far. There's not even a close second. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10190.72s)]
*  And so, this is anybody who's like hesitant to coalition over this right now while we're at the [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10196.32s)]
*  precipice of another war. I mean, come on, that's just like that cannot be the case. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10202.96s)]
*  And so, it's just like we gotta wake up, we gotta learn that there are other issues we're [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10210.0s)]
*  gonna disagree about. There's gonna be lots of really important issues we disagree about. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10214.96s)]
*  We don't have to not do that. We don't have to pretend we're not disagreeing about them. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10218.32s)]
*  But this is so important that you have to coalition on this. Anyway, that was part one. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10222.4s)]
*  I had a part two, but I'm sorry, I got lost in that rant and forgot it. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10227.119999999999s)]
*  Back to it for a second. So look, to your points, number one, remember this is layered, right? [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10229.84s)]
*  So if they vote yes for the war, we're all voting them out no matter what, right? Because it's not [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10235.04s)]
*  like the other Democrat in the primary or the other Republican in the primary isn't gonna have [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10240.64s)]
*  most of the issues you agree with anyway, right? And second of all, if they vote no on the war, [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10244.24s)]
*  then we can go back to fighting about tax cuts and microaggressions and all of that, right? [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10249.2s)]
*  So it doesn't mean they get a free pass, that they get to stay in Congress forever. No, [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10254.16s)]
*  it's just table stakes, right? But if you vote against America and you say no, I want the elites [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10257.92s)]
*  to win. I want the neocons to win. I want Israel first to win. I want all these guys to win and [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10263.2s)]
*  we're gonna drive you into this war. No, you're gone. It's table stakes, okay? We're not interested. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10267.92s)]
*  We're not having that conversation. And so now to your point about this being the most important [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10273.04s)]
*  issue. Look, I remember growing up thinking, I wonder what I would have done during the Holocaust. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10278.8s)]
*  Would I have had enough courage to fight back? Because at the time that required a tremendous [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10283.68s)]
*  amount of courage. We look back at it and go, well, of course we would all fought back, right? [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10290.16s)]
*  But they didn't. The overwhelming majority of the Germans did not fight back. And I always wondered [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10294.880000000001s)]
*  if we would have had the courage to fight back, right? And so to you made the analogy about [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10299.92s)]
*  slavery, I'll make the analogy about this. So if at the time you were debating microaggressions, [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10304.64s)]
*  instead of trying to stop the Holocaust, you made the wrong moral calculation, right? [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10311.52s)]
*  And so here we have a genocide and we now have a new war. And we know how many hundreds of thousands [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10317.2s)]
*  of people died in Iraq. We know how many soldiers we lost. We know how much we lost. If you can't [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10322.880000000001s)]
*  unite on this, you're basically saying we're not the United States of America. And we're gonna fight [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10328.640000000001s)]
*  each other till the cows come home. And by the way, Dave, isn't this how the elites win? [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10333.2s)]
*  They get you to look left, to look right, to see where your problems are. The left's my problems, [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10340.56s)]
*  the right's my problems. No, brother, look up, look up, right? That's where your problems are [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10345.92s)]
*  with the powerful. That's exactly right, Cenk. I mean, exactly. And look, if you turn on any of the [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10351.439999999999s)]
*  corporate cable news media or you read the New York Times or like any other Washington Post or [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10359.199999999999s)]
*  any of this stuff, right? It's always they're like obsessed with whatever the fight about [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10364.08s)]
*  transgenderism or racism. I'm saying from whichever side they're coming at it from, [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10370.16s)]
*  whether it's the Fox News side or the MSNBC side. How many times are they just running a story [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10374.88s)]
*  about, I don't know, hey, there's the CIA. And they did all of these really terrible things. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10380.48s)]
*  And they're like a secret paramilitary organization that has an unbelievable amount of influence on [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10386.64s)]
*  the Congress and the presidency and our foreign policy. What have you ever seen a story about that? [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10392.4s)]
*  Any of them, they never wanna, what did they ever just talk about? Like, hey, the Federal Reserve [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10397.68s)]
*  just had a meeting. There's a group of like a handful of bankers who dictate the entire global [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10401.52s)]
*  economy. Isn't that crazy? It never even comes up. You could watch CNN all day every day and [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10407.12s)]
*  never even know there is a Federal Reserve. It just never comes up. It's like a topic that's [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10414.880000000001s)]
*  not even discussed. And so the question isn't whether you think the Fed should be tightening [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10420.32s)]
*  or easing. The question is like, how come it never comes up? Why do they love these cultural [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10426.48s)]
*  issues that pit all of us against each other? And then it creates this kind of like funhouse [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10431.52s)]
*  mirror version of society where like, I don't know. I mean, I guess we're all in our own bubbles, [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10436.16s)]
*  but like I'll see people arguing about like whether gender is a social construct and there's no such [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10445.119999999999s)]
*  thing. And then you'll have other people being like trad cons who are like women's places in the [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10455.84s)]
*  kitchen and only the men should work and only this. And you're like, I've never met a person who has [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10462.08s)]
*  either of these views. I've never met anybody who thought like this represents no one. What are we [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10467.12s)]
*  even talking about here, man? These distract, neither of these things are happening. We're [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10472.56s)]
*  never gonna live in a world where there's no such thing as a difference between men and women. And [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10477.44s)]
*  we're not going back to 1949 when only men work and women stay home. It's just madness. It's like [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10481.2s)]
*  all these distractions so that nobody focuses on how the most powerful people in this society [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10488.400000000001s)]
*  have totally rigged the game in their behalf so that they can rape the rest of us. And a big part [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10494.400000000001s)]
*  of that is starting these, what the government likes to call wars, where we have civilian [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10500.560000000001s)]
*  casualties, aka mass murder campaigns done by states. And it's the most disgusting thing [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10507.04s)]
*  in the world. We're finally at a point where we can wake up to this. And to your point before, [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10515.84s)]
*  because I do remember my second point of that other thing I was gonna say, when you talk about [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10522.240000000002s)]
*  how much the people are against this and how much they've lost control of the narrative, [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10527.28s)]
*  I will just say that states, governments, no matter what you think of them, whether they're [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10532.24s)]
*  authoritarian dictatorships or democracies, if democracies ever really exist or democratic [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10538.64s)]
*  socialist countries or whatever, they all rely on propaganda. They all use propaganda. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10544.72s)]
*  And why is that? Why do they launch propaganda campaigns? It's because at least they believe, [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10551.119999999999s)]
*  I would argue they know, that they need to convince us of their legitimacy. They can't [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10557.44s)]
*  do this without that. If you think about all of the major government policies, they always needed [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10564.480000000001s)]
*  propaganda campaigns to get them through. Either side of any war, even the just side of a war, [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10570.640000000001s)]
*  they need propaganda to convince their people to do that. And they have lost the ability, [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10577.12s)]
*  they've lost the propaganda mechanism. And so I don't know exactly what that means. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10583.04s)]
*  But we're in a brave new world now, brother. We are not in the same place that we used to be. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10588.640000000001s)]
*  You cannot imagine them trying in 2002 when they were building up the war propaganda for Iraq. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10593.76s)]
*  Just imagine, we had Bill O'Reilly was the number one show at that time. Imagine now, [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10600.720000000001s)]
*  and I know a lot of people, they'll beat up these guys for not being perfect. But the truth is, [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10607.44s)]
*  Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and all the people out there, they're just way less controlled than [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10613.519999999999s)]
*  Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity and Chris Matthews were. And so we at least have a fighting shot now. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10619.599999999999s)]
*  These guys will at least host voices that will break down the opposing point of view. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10625.839999999998s)]
*  So yeah, we got a fighting shot like we've never had before. And then at the same time, [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10632.56s)]
*  it's almost something out of a Greek tragedy or a biblical story. We got a fighting shot like [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10637.519999999999s)]
*  we've never had before. And also, we're in a much more dangerous and much weaker position. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10642.4s)]
*  Our country is $37 trillion in debt and we're very divided culturally. And Iran is a much tougher [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10648.32s)]
*  opponent than the other countries in the war. So okay, so we're at a point here. And I think [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10657.84s)]
*  let me just say this, I'm sorry if I'm ranting for too long. But I like to make this point, [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10664.56s)]
*  because sometimes people will ask me, especially young men ask me this a lot. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10668.8s)]
*  How do you not get blackpilled? How do you not just be depressed about the future? [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10675.359999999999s)]
*  If I just laid out this case where we have this amazing opportunity, but also the odds are stacked [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10680.88s)]
*  against us and the situation's more dire than ever before. What do you do in that situation? [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10685.119999999999s)]
*  And the analogy that I like to use is like, look, I got a wife and I got two little kids. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10690.32s)]
*  If I look out my door and I see five men with AR-15s rushing my house and they're coming in [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10697.279999999999s)]
*  to kill me and my family. And I just have one gun in my house. I could sit there and go, [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10706.48s)]
*  oh man, I'm blackpilled. This sucks. There's five of them, they got better guns than I got. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10715.439999999999s)]
*  This is so unfair. I just don't see how I'm possibly gonna win this situation. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10722.56s)]
*  Listen, dude, you don't have the option to feel that way. You got a gun? Okay, try to get down low, [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10728.32s)]
*  turn the lights off, take out their legs while they're coming in. You know what I mean? I got [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10735.84s)]
*  some gasoline in my shed. Maybe I could build a makeshift bomb real quick and launch it at them. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10739.6s)]
*  I don't care. You go out fighting. If you've got a shot and your family's on the line, [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10744.08s)]
*  what are we talking about here? You go for it and you try your best. And so right now, [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10752.64s)]
*  it's like, if we're gonna go out, let's at least go out trying our best to do something. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10757.359999999999s)]
*  We got better odds than a lot of people before us. You know, Cenk, as I'm sure you know the [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10761.76s)]
*  history of this well, there were anti-war protesters during World War I who simply just [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10765.6s)]
*  got locked up by the Wilson regime. They just got thrown in insane asylums or prisons or whatever. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10770.24s)]
*  In fact, Eugene Depp's, right? There was a presidential candidate who ran for president [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10776.16s)]
*  from prison. And so we have it so much better than some people in the past had it. We have so [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10780.48s)]
*  much more of a fighting shot. And if they didn't just give up, then we don't have the right to [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10785.6s)]
*  just give up. Yeah, I think what you're looking for is this time to man up. Okay, and so, and look, [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10790.8s)]
*  this is why I hate the culture worse. There's so many reasons to the point that you made. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10798.24s)]
*  Guys, it doesn't matter if somebody says man up. It doesn't mean that women can't do it, right? [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10803.359999999999s)]
*  You can say knuckle up like Richard Ojeda does. You can say cowboy up, and that doesn't mean that [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10808.16s)]
*  you're against Native Americans. Just calm down and just get together, right? And listen to what [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10812.48s)]
*  Dave said. The culture wars, it's not that things in there aren't important. I'm Muslim, so I get it. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10818.88s)]
*  Some people can get attacked for their religion, etc., and their identity, and it's terrible, [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10825.36s)]
*  right? So we're not minimizing it. But they use it to divide us. They get us to fight one another, [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10830.56s)]
*  and the culture wars is the main weapon they use to get us to fight each other. Why? [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10837.76s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. Because if we're fighting each other, we're not looking up, right? [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10843.52s)]
*  Well, look, let me put it like this, right? Say something like abortion, okay? [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10848.800000000001s)]
*  Abortion's a very important issue, no matter what side of it you're on. If you're on, from the pro [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10854.800000000001s)]
*  choice perspective, people are trying to infringe on women's basic natural rights, [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10861.44s)]
*  and they're controlling their medical decisions, and they're controlling their bodies, and forcing [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10868.4s)]
*  a woman to carry a baby to term. From the pro choice position, this is a very, very important [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10874.720000000001s)]
*  issue. From the pro life position, it's a very, very important issue. It's the murder of babies, [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10879.92s)]
*  and you wanna stop the murder of babies. Wherever you fall on that, I'm not denying it's a very [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10885.52s)]
*  important issue. The point is that no one in power is threatened by that issue, you know what I mean? [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10889.52s)]
*  So they don't mind you fighting about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you go fight about that. You go fight [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10896.4s)]
*  about trans bathrooms, and what you should say about transgender people's preferred pronouns, [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10900.960000000001s)]
*  and all this. I'm not even saying, none of us are saying you shouldn't have a side in that issue. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10907.2s)]
*  No one's saying that it's not a very important issue. But the point is like peep game here, [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10911.36s)]
*  as they used to say in the 90s. See what's really going on. Why are all the most powerful [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10916.88s)]
*  billionaires and giant corporate interests pushing these culture war issues? Maybe it's so we don't [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10922.96s)]
*  pay attention to what they're doing, which is destroying our country. So that's the point of [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10929.439999999999s)]
*  it. It's not that we shouldn't fight about these things, or that they're not important. It's just [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10936.16s)]
*  that we should at least notice that they think we're so stupid that we'll be distracted by this, [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10939.92s)]
*  and not notice what they're doing to us. Yeah, and it's okay to be honest about your side. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10945.52s)]
*  Chapter five of my book, Justice is Coming, is about the matrix. That's mainstream media, [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10951.28s)]
*  and how Chris Matthews lied us into the Iraq war. And by the way, I mean, you read some of his [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10955.6s)]
*  comments describing George Bush as a cowboy, and someone else is a soldier, and he just plays dress [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10961.92s)]
*  up, and my God, the power force so amazing. That's why we have to go into Iraq, etc. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10970.56s)]
*  And he was supposed to be a Democrat. Obama did violate due process. He killed people, [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10975.76s)]
*  he killed American citizens without due process. When you open that door, then very bad things come [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10981.439999999999s)]
*  out of that door. It's important that you hold your own side accountable, because you don't know [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10987.68s)]
*  what the other side is gonna do with it. And besides which, at the end of the day, [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10992.56s)]
*  you should care more about being an American than you should about either side that you're on, [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=10997.52s)]
*  right? Whether it's parties, it's ethnicities, whatever it might be. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11002.32s)]
*  So Dave, to conclude here, at least, look, a lot of people will say, no way, [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11006.32s)]
*  Cenk doesn't represent the left. Somebody else does, or the other guy does, etc, right? [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11013.52s)]
*  But for whoever agrees with me on the left, that we should get together to fight against this war, [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11018.16s)]
*  cuz this war is that important. I will say on behalf of those people on the left, [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11023.28s)]
*  I am happy to make an alliance with you. And I think that in terms of Libertarians, [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11028.960000000001s)]
*  I don't know anyone that represents them better than you do. So do we have an alliance here [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11033.36s)]
*  between progressives and Libertarians to fight the war together? [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11038.16s)]
*  Yeah, 100% to fight the war is an interesting phrase to use in this particular context, [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11041.84s)]
*  but I get what you're saying. And yes, 100%. And I also think it's good for people to understand [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11049.28s)]
*  that a lot of these distinctions are somewhat of an illusion and they're somewhat arbitrary. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11057.52s)]
*  I'm not saying there's anything, there are differences between left-wing people and [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11068.08s)]
*  right-wing people. The truth is that I think almost all of us have a left-winger and a [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11071.6s)]
*  right-winger within us. This is just true in general in life. There are areas that you're [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11077.6s)]
*  a little bit more conservative, there's an areas where you're a little bit more liberal, [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11083.92s)]
*  and that's true in general. These terms in a way like the left meaning more egalitarian, [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11088.720000000001s)]
*  right meaning more hierarchical, we're all a little bit of both of those things in some ways [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11097.52s)]
*  in our lives. But the point is that, look man, there's really brilliant interesting left-wing [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11103.76s)]
*  thinkers. There's really brilliant interesting right-wing thinkers. I'd encourage people to [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11108.48s)]
*  read more of the opposite. You know what I mean? If you're a left-winger, read some really smart [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11112.48s)]
*  right-wingers and vice versa. But yeah, again, this is an issue that's so important and it's [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11117.44s)]
*  really not like a lot of these things don't even come down to a left-right divide. It's not really [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11124.32s)]
*  about that. I mean, I don't know when you're opposing genocide and wars of choice. Are you [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11129.92s)]
*  really talking about like a left-right split? I think this is just kind of like a human being [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11135.44s)]
*  thing and we should all be against this. I mean, what are we talking about here? We're talking [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11139.84s)]
*  about we just facilitated our greatest ally. Maybe they facilitated us. I don't exactly know [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11144.24s)]
*  what the relationship is these days, but we just at best case, we facilitated our greatest ally to [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11151.12s)]
*  launch an aggressive sneak attack on a country that poses no threat to us, no threat to us [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11156.96s)]
*  whatsoever. And we're gonna go into a war of choice with them. Come on, we can all be against that. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11162.16s)]
*  Yeah. And by the way, let's lead by example. We want the world to get the peace. We want the [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11167.679999999998s)]
*  Israelis and the Palestinians and the Israelis and Iranians to get the peace. So let's make peace [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11173.119999999999s)]
*  with one another. And that peace can lead to the greater peace where we push the powerful into [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11177.359999999999s)]
*  accepting things on our terms for once. And do we all agree? Look at the poll, [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11186.48s)]
*  only 16% want this war. Of course we agree. So unitedagainstwar.com, unitedagainstwar.com. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11191.199999999999s)]
*  Let's all take action. Dave and I are gonna go and talk to as many different shows and folks [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11198.0s)]
*  as we can and take this message of unity against the war to those folks. Check out his show. It's [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11202.8s)]
*  called Part of the Problem. But here, of course, he's part of the solution. So Dave Smith, thank [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11208.64s)]
*  you so much for joining us, brother. And thank you for being part of this bold alliance. And [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11214.16s)]
*  we don't know where it's gonna go, but let's at least give it a shot. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11220.72s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much for having me, Cenk. Let's do it again real soon. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11224.24s)]
*  All right, God bless. We'll see you tomorrow. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11228.48s)]
*  you [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLG8QoRnAls&t=11244.16s)]
