# Republicans WIMP Out On Taxing Ultra Wealthy
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8)
*  I don't understand why they didn't move to higher taxes on the very, very wealthy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=0.0s)]
*  That would be politically expedient. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=5.8s)]
*  It would go down well with everybody except David Bonson. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=8.0s)]
*  Well, I'm with David on this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=11.0s)]
*  Not only because I think it would be bad, bad policy, those people are already paying [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=13.0s)]
*  high level rates of tax, 37% top rate of tax. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=17.64s)]
*  I just don't want any of our audience to think that I would want higher taxes on wealthy [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=21.32s)]
*  people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=25.72s)]
*  I'm just saying it would be politically expedient. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=26.72s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=28.0s)]
*  No, no, no, Stuart, don't worry. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=30.8s)]
*  No one would make the mistake of thinking you personally would want to increase taxes [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=32.44s)]
*  on yourself as a television anchor who's probably raking in quite a bit of money in your television [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=36.4s)]
*  contract. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=42.24s)]
*  But nonetheless, give credit where credit is due because Fox business host Stuart Varney [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=43.24s)]
*  admitted the obvious yesterday. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=48.64s)]
*  He admitted that raising taxes on the ultra wealthy would be a popular thing to do. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=51.92s)]
*  In fact, that's something that Trump realized as well, which is why he decided to sheepishly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  float the idea of increasing taxes on the ultra wealthy in his big beautiful bill. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=63.6s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about the fate of what happened when he made that proposal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=68.88s)]
*  So Republicans love, absolutely love giving handouts to the ultra rich and of course, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  their elite donors. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=80.08s)]
*  So much so that of course they're refusing to do what's politically popular in this situation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=81.64s)]
*  Look, if you go back to 2017 and you look at public opinion polling on Trump's big bill [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=86.92s)]
*  back then, his tax bill, it did not pull well. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=94.12s)]
*  And it's because most Americans, although the media likes to treat them like they're [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=98.52s)]
*  idiots, most Americans are pretty sappy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=102.56s)]
*  And while they might have gotten a little bit of a tax break as ordinary working Americans, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=105.12s)]
*  the bulk, the disproportionate amount of savings on taxes, of course, went to the rich and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=110.92s)]
*  the ultra wealthy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=118.64s)]
*  So it would pull poorly for that reason. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=119.92s)]
*  Now, Republicans hear what Trump has to say. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  They're like, yeah, maybe this would be politically popular. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=126.44s)]
*  But remember, we're just, we're whores for our donors and our donors don't want to see [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=128.76s)]
*  their taxes raised. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=134.2s)]
*  And so despite Trump briefly and timidly suggesting that GOP lawmakers should consider increasing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=136.56s)]
*  taxes on the wealthiest Americans, the House officially rejected the idea. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=142.24s)]
*  It was not included in their version of the tax cut and border funding bill that they've [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=146.8s)]
*  passed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=154.56s)]
*  And so the Senate is basically likely to do the same. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=155.96s)]
*  That's my prediction. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  So we'll get to what they're saying in just a moment. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  So the legislation House Republicans approved last week excluded the millionaire tax and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=163.2s)]
*  other proposals to raise taxes on top earners. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=167.68s)]
*  Now look, let's just pause for a second because I want to always make clear that I don't believe [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=170.8s)]
*  in raising taxes for taxes sake, okay? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=178.16s)]
*  I think the federal government and local governments for sure do squander a lot of our resources. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  It really depends on what the money is spent for. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=188.28s)]
*  So if we're talking about raising taxes so we can send Israel another $26 billion military [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  aid package, yeah, I'm not interested. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=197.72s)]
*  Regardless of where that tax money or revenue is gonna come from. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=200.76s)]
*  However, we have a lot of problems in this country, a lot of problems that need resources [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=204.2s)]
*  to solve. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=208.68s)]
*  I just wish we had the politicians who were laser focused on solving those issues. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=210.0s)]
*  Because in that case, I can turn to our tax system and say, no, no, we absolutely need [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=214.88s)]
*  to raise taxes because we need to fund this program. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=219.56s)]
*  I'll give you a specific example. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=222.12s)]
*  There's a lot of concern that our social security program will be insolvent soon. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=224.4s)]
*  Well, there's a very specific tax. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=229.4s)]
*  It's the social security tax that you can see on your pay stub every time you get paid. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=231.36s)]
*  You see how much of your earnings go towards social security. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=235.84s)]
*  Well, as we've talked about multiple times on the show before, there is a cap in regard [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  to the amount of income. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=244.68s)]
*  An individual can get taxed for social security, why don't we raise that cap? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=247.4s)]
*  Maybe even eliminate that cap, I don't know. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=250.96s)]
*  But raise the cap to ensure that social security is fully funded and insolvent, easy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay, now let's get back to this big beautiful bill, cuz I have some more details that I [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=259.24s)]
*  wanna share with you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=263.24s)]
*  So now we're learning that the half-baked effort to include these measures to raise [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=264.24s)]
*  taxes on the rich were put to bed by none other than a gentleman you might have heard [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=271.44s)]
*  of. We've talked about him on the show before, but it's been some time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  His name is Grover Norquist, and he's an anti-tax advocate, an activist. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  He is a particularly lonesome person. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=286.56s)]
*  I'm not a fan of his. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  He likes to launder his reputation by talking about how he likes to go to Burning Man as [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  if he's a human being who likes to have fun and do good things. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=296.04s)]
*  In reality, he likes to strip the federal government of necessary resources so it can't [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=300.6s)]
*  function properly. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=307.68s)]
*  And he has no problem with ordinary working Americans paying a disproportionate amount [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=308.68s)]
*  of their income toward taxes, while the ultra wealthy basically get away with, in some cases, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  paying close to nothing because of some of the deductions they're able to take advantage [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=319.72s)]
*  of. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=323.24s)]
*  So Trump went to his daddy, Grover Norquist. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=324.24s)]
*  He's like, daddy, I'm thinking about doing something politically popular. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=326.8s)]
*  I'm thinking about cutting taxes on working Americans. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=330.92s)]
*  OK, that would be popular. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=335.88000000000005s)]
*  But also in order to do something about this disastrous debt that we have in the United [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=338.24s)]
*  States, a debt so high that we spent a trillion dollars last year servicing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=344.48s)]
*  I want to do something about that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  So maybe I should raise taxes on the ultra rich. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=351.12s)]
*  And you want to know what his daddy told him? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=354.16s)]
*  No, don't do it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=356.08s)]
*  You think Grover Norquist is going to give Trump permission to raise taxes on the rich [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=358.0s)]
*  when his entire purpose in life has been to essentially be an activist to prevent that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  from happening? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=368.4s)]
*  Of course, Norquist was going to tell him no. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=369.4s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  Trump took orders. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=372.32s)]
*  And so he dropped it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=373.76s)]
*  Now, according to the Washington Post, on May 7th, Norquist got a call from President [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  Trump about 15 minutes before he boarded a flight to Poland. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=380.32s)]
*  In the time before the plane took off, Trump gave his arguments for raising taxes on the rich. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=384.08s)]
*  Norquist pushed back, arguing that such a maneuver would prove a politically disastrous [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=390.32s)]
*  attack on the small business community, he said of the call. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=396.56s)]
*  OK, but if you're worried about the small business community, which I don't believe [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=401.28s)]
*  at all when it comes to Grover Norquist, there are certain deductions. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=406.24s)]
*  There are certain ways you could help small businesses out. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=409.6s)]
*  We're talking about the ultra rich here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  The fact of the matter is Grover Norquist doesn't want to see taxes raised on the ultra rich. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=416.32s)]
*  It's never enough for them, never enough. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  So shortly after landing in Warsaw, Norquist received a call from House Speaker Mike Johnson, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  just to ease any panic that Norquist might have. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=430.16s)]
*  It's going to be OK, Norquist, we're looking out for you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=434.32000000000005s)]
*  So what did Mike Johnson have to say? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, that tax increase for the ultra rich would not be in the final legislation. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=438.64s)]
*  Now, let me just pause for a second because the fact of the matter is, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=445.2s)]
*  while there might be a populist wing of the GOP electorate, the voters, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=448.08s)]
*  I want to be absolutely clear in saying that the Republican party [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=455.68s)]
*  still is what it has always been. The pro-corporate party, the party of millionaires, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=459.36s)]
*  billionaires, the party that has no problem with working class Americans paying a disproportionate [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=465.2s)]
*  amount of their income toward federal taxes. But they will fight like hell to ensure that the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  ultra rich pay far less percentage wise when it comes to their income. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=475.84s)]
*  So Norquist even bragged about the influence he has over our politicians as if it's something to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=482.08s)]
*  really be proud about, as if it's really difficult to legally bribe our politicians [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=489.44s)]
*  to get them to do whatever they want. Now, he says, we showed how weak and non-existent [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=494.24s)]
*  this quote unquote movement for higher taxes is within the Republican party. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  The House and the Senate have been in lockstep. This is not happening, period. But I'm glad we [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=505.6s)]
*  had this movement because it allowed us to expose this little cancer cell in the party, pushing the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=511.52s)]
*  idea. So Grover Norquist, I mean, you heard it here first, folks. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=519.2s)]
*  Grover Norquist believes that Donald Trump, the President of the United States, is a little cancer [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=523.36s)]
*  cell. He's the one who pitched the idea of increasing taxes on the ultra wealthy, didn't he? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=529.28s)]
*  Grover Norquist just called Trump cancer. And I just want to know, is Trump going to take that? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=535.92s)]
*  First of all, why are you taking orders from Grover Norquist? I thought you were the President of the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=542.48s)]
*  United States. Pretty pathetic, isn't it? But let me continue. So he's right that the Republican [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=547.2s)]
*  movement for higher taxes is weak. I think it's non-existent. I mean, Republican politicians [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=556.1600000000001s)]
*  are not engaged in a movement to raise taxes on the ultra rich. They never will be. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=561.2800000000001s)]
*  While the tax increase or increases were nicks, the legislation that was passed by the House [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=568.0s)]
*  did include several measures that disproportionately benefit Americans in the top income brackets. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=576.64s)]
*  So I want to get into the details on that. So it extends the tax cut Republicans first approved [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=582.0s)]
*  in 2017 for the highest income bracket, those earning more than $626,000 per year. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=586.96s)]
*  The bill passed by the House also extends the estate tax, which would not apply to fortunes [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=593.92s)]
*  of up to $15 million or $30 million for married couples. Thank God. Thank God. I mean, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  how would that married couple survive if that $30 million they inherited was taxed? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=606.88s)]
*  How would they survive? They'd be out on the streets. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=614.56s)]
*  Think about the rich people who have inherited all that money. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=618.4s)]
*  I mean, thank God Grover Norquist saved them. Now, because of those provisions, the wealthiest [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=622.4s)]
*  Americans will benefit and the poorest obviously will be hit, especially if they rely on our social [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=629.76s)]
*  safety net. Take a look. So take a look at this chart. That longest line there is how much the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=636.24s)]
*  bill would increase income for the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans, while actually reducing income for [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=643.04s)]
*  the poorest 10%. This is according to Penn's Wharton School of Business. If you're in the top [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=649.6s)]
*  20% of Americans, you're gonna get roughly a 3.7% increase in your after-tax income, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=654.72s)]
*  really all from these tax cuts. But if you go all the way to the bottom and everything in between [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=661.84s)]
*  essentially leads you to the bottom, if you're in the bottom 20%, you actually lose $800. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=667.0400000000001s)]
*  Why do you lose $800? You get a very small tax cut and you get a very large cut in Medicaid [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=672.64s)]
*  and these other benefits that we were just talking about that affects the 20% disproportionately. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=680.08s)]
*  So this is a highly regressive bill that essentially favors the wealthy, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=684.88s)]
*  doesn't do much for the middle class and hurts the poor. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=689.44s)]
*  Thank God. I mean, all those poor people, do they really need that healthcare? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  They didn't need that healthcare. The rich people though, they needed the tax cuts. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=699.52s)]
*  They needed the tax breaks. Grover Norquist is right. Screw the poor people. Screw all those kids [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=703.76s)]
*  who might wanna see a dentist or might have an issue with chickenpox or an infection and [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=709.12s)]
*  might need to see a doctor. Who cares about them? We gotta give the money to the rich. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=716.0s)]
*  I mean, they do so many great things with it, like invest in the crypto industry. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=720.88s)]
*  That really benefits society, doesn't it? Anyway, let's keep going. So the biggest [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=727.28s)]
*  beneficiaries of the bill would be those earning between $460,800 and $1.1 million per year, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=732.08s)]
*  a category primarily composed of small business owners and high income professionals such as [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=739.6s)]
*  lawyers and doctors, according to Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=745.84s)]
*  Institute, which is actually a center-right think tank. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=752.64s)]
*  So a center-right think tank is admitting, yeah, high income earners are gonna be the ones who [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=755.84s)]
*  benefit the most from these tax breaks. Now, after that though, the top 1% are the biggest winners, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=760.32s)]
*  and that's based on the same analysis. Analysts say Republicans in the Senate are even less likely [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=767.44s)]
*  to back higher taxes on the top income bracket, and that really should come as no surprise. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=774.6400000000001s)]
*  The upper chamber, higher chamber tends to be a little more conservative than the House of [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=779.36s)]
*  Representatives. So it doesn't surprise me at all that they're less likely to approve [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=783.84s)]
*  additional taxes or higher taxes on the ultra rich. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=789.52s)]
*  Now, there was some hope that right-wing populists like Steve Bannon would be able [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=792.88s)]
*  to convince Trump to put more pressure on lawmakers to move in the direction of increasing [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  taxes on the rich. And look, I probably would agree that Bannon is the one in his ear who [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=803.6s)]
*  put that idea in his head in the first place. But let's just make one thing clear. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=810.64s)]
*  When Donald Trump wants something, he gets it. He fights for it. He'll stop at nothing. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=814.88s)]
*  Now, when it came to the House of Representatives passing the bill, Homeboy was in the House, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=821.76s)]
*  okay, bullying Republican lawmakers every day until they had the votes to pass it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=828.4s)]
*  If he really wanted to raise taxes on the rich, he would have done it. He would have gotten it done. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=835.76s)]
*  So I don't think he actually wanted it. I think he understands the political benefits. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=842.32s)]
*  I think he understands that at least engaging in some behavior that gives his base the idea [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=848.88s)]
*  that he is a populist is beneficial for the Trump administration. But he didn't fight for it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=856.96s)]
*  He doesn't really want it. And he probably thinks whatever, I can probably spin this and make my [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=863.6s)]
*  base happy anyway, even though the bulk of this bill disproportionately benefits the richest among [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=868.0s)]
*  us. Now, Michael Strain, who's an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, also argues that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=875.28s)]
*  what we're seeing is the center of gravity in the Republican Party is still much closer to where it [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=883.6s)]
*  was under Mitt Romney than is commonly thought. There's support for Trumpian nationalism, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=888.72s)]
*  but it's not the dominant disposition in the way a lot of people think it is. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=896.2399999999999s)]
*  Rather than there being no Republicans who want to boost taxes on the rich, there are just very few. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=901.8399999999999s)]
*  And look, guys, I want to reiterate, we're talking about the Republican politicians, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=909.04s)]
*  the political class. We're not talking about the voters. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=913.5999999999999s)]
*  I would venture to say that if you sat down and talked to a huge portion of Trump supporters, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=916.4s)]
*  they're sick of corporate greed. They're sick of the tax breaks that the ultra rich get to enjoy. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=922.56s)]
*  I mean, they rail against the elite constantly. And the reason why a lot of them left the Democratic [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=928.7199999999999s)]
*  Party is because they were under the impression, an accurate impression, that the Democratic Party [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  abandoned the working class. But the big scam here is that the Trump administration and some [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=938.64s)]
*  Republicans really position themselves as the party of the working class. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=945.3599999999999s)]
*  But as we know, talk is cheap. You have to actually look at their actions. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=949.6s)]
*  And the Republican political class has no interest in looking out for the working class at all. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=953.76s)]
*  So I have a lot of empathy for voters. I don't have any malice in my heart for them because, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, we don't have a lot of good options, as you can imagine. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=965.0400000000001s)]
*  So they're doing the best with what we had in this last election cycle. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=968.96s)]
*  But my ire is absolutely directed at these disgusting, phony politicians who like to fashion [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=972.56s)]
*  themselves as economic populists when in reality, they're anything but. They're little whores for [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=980.64s)]
*  their donors, okay? And they themselves are rich. They themselves don't wanna pay higher taxes. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=987.04s)]
*  They're not gonna raise their own taxes. We think about how many of these politicians on [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=993.04s)]
*  both sides of the aisle have been in Congress for, in some cases, decades. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=997.2s)]
*  Really, you're gonna become a multimillionaire earning $170,000 a year in salary? Yeah, okay. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=1002.96s)]
*  So Senator Josh Hawley told reporters last week that Trump is still pushing legislation to raise [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=1011.6800000000001s)]
*  taxes on private equity groups. But honestly, I would take that with a grain of salt. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't think Trump is pressuring anyone to raise taxes on anything, okay? So [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=1022.1600000000001s)]
*  I think he floated the idea, Norquist, his daddy shut it down. No increased taxes on the ultra rich. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=1026.72s)]
*  They'll be able to continue hoarding their wealth to the detriment of this country. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=1033.9199999999998s)]
*  So congratulations. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YiFghdXz8&t=1037.28s)]
