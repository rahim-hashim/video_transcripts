TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Hating Your Tesla May Be A Crime Soon
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8)
*  The real problem is not a lot the people, it's not like the crazy guy that fire bombs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=0.0s)]
*  at Tesla dealership. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=7.18s)]
*  It's the people pushing the propaganda that caused that guy to do it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=9.34s)]
*  Those are the real villains here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=16.9s)]
*  And we're gonna go after them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=18.38s)]
*  And the president's made it clear we're gonna go after them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=20.66s)]
*  Okay, so we have made very clear on the show this network that acts of property damage [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=23.66s)]
*  our crimes and shouldn't be done. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=29.86s)]
*  There's been a couple instances of that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=32.02s)]
*  And this is now a thing that for multiple weeks, basically everyone in the highest reaches [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=34.5s)]
*  of the Trump administration have apparently been spending a massive amount of time on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=38.82s)]
*  Because they say that this is hurting Tesla, I guess. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=42.7s)]
*  I guess this is why their stock price is going down, not because of Elon Musk's reputation, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=45.82s)]
*  which he has seemingly willfully done a great deal of damage to. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=51.66s)]
*  And it takes the government, the White House, the president himself jumping into action [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=55.419999999999995s)]
*  to protect them in this particular case. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=61.17999999999999s)]
*  He made a couple of points there earlier about those who bear ultimate responsibility for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=63.739999999999995s)]
*  even individual acts of property damage like this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=67.88s)]
*  And we're certainly gonna wanna return to that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=71.44s)]
*  But in this appearance with Bret Baer, Elon Musk had more to say. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=73.17999999999999s)]
*  Let's jump to that video first. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=76.24s)]
*  You don't have to be here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=77.62s)]
*  There's now been these many cases of violence and vandalism at Tesla dealerships. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=79.46s)]
*  How does that affect your employees, your customers? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=85.3s)]
*  What does it mean to you? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=87.86s)]
*  How have you taken that in? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=88.86s)]
*  Well I think a great wrong is being done to the people of Tesla and to our customers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=92.41999999999999s)]
*  Tesla is a peaceful company that has made great cars, great products. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=97.5s)]
*  That's all it's done. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=101.89999999999999s)]
*  It hasn't harmed anyone. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=102.89999999999999s)]
*  And yet people are committing violence. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=105.78s)]
*  They're firebombing Tesla dealerships. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=108.18s)]
*  They're shooting guns into stores. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=110.18s)]
*  They're threatening people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=113.02000000000001s)]
*  They're issuing death threats against me and other Tesla personnel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  What are they doing this for? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=121.86s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=123.54s)]
*  And what's happening, it seems to me, is they're being fed propaganda by the far left. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=124.54s)]
*  And they believe it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=131.52s)]
*  The ones providing the money, the ones pushing the lies and propaganda, we're going after [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=132.7s)]
*  them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=138.98s)]
*  So again, many times we've said don't shoot at these dealerships. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=140.7s)]
*  You could end up killing someone who has nothing to do with Doge, might not like Elon Musk [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=143.98s)]
*  individually, might even agree with you on the politics. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=149.94s)]
*  The vast majority of the course has been property damage. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  And he seems utterly incapable of acknowledging why people might have a problem with him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=156.06s)]
*  And I don't know, it's always hard with Elon Musk to know if it's just because he's this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=162.74s)]
*  stupid, which I think he is, or this dishonest, which I think he is. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=166.1s)]
*  It's one or maybe both in this case. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  His refusal to acknowledge that the damage to his reputation and the associated reputation [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=172.24s)]
*  of Tesla might be due to the choices he's made and the terrible things he's done that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=177.06s)]
*  have ruined thousands, tens of thousands of lives, just government workers as one example. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=181.94s)]
*  I would also briefly point out that Tesla's have done damage to people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=189.02s)]
*  His desire to rush out full self-driving when it wasn't actually safe and his engineers [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=193.06s)]
*  have been clear of that, has undoubtedly resulted in bodily harm and deaths. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=197.5s)]
*  The weird thing about the doors locking and people being unable to get out when the car's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=202.24s)]
*  on fire, those sorts of things are not peaceful in the way he's talking about. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=206.3s)]
*  The most important thing there is they are not willing to accept that this might be individual [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=210.3s)]
*  people breaking the law because they don't like him or the company. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=215.74s)]
*  No, it has to be bigger than that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  Somebody has to be funding it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=221.58s)]
*  And even if they're not, who is making people believe that Tesla's bad? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=222.86s)]
*  Who is maybe making videos or posting things? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't matter if they actually broke the law to Elon Musk and apparently to Donald [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=231.66000000000003s)]
*  Trump, the two co-presidents of the United States. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=236.5s)]
*  We're the ones fundamentally who we have to go after, which I think raises some interesting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=238.62s)]
*  questions. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  When people post like on Libs of TikTok or Matt Walsh, they post about hospitals and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  they make it seem as if they're butchering kids or something. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  And then there's bomb threats against them. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=254.86s)]
*  Libs of TikTok didn't do the bomb threat. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=257.02s)]
*  But does anyone believe that the individual who did would have done that bomb threat if [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=260.22s)]
*  they hadn't seen those posts online, on YouTube, on Rumble, on Twitter, whatever? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=263.88s)]
*  Now I don't think that those people broke the law. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=269.6s)]
*  I don't think those people should rot in jail, but evidently Elon Musk does. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=272.12s)]
*  And so who is it that led people to bomb abortion clinics or murder the doctors performing them? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=277.8s)]
*  Who are the ones who inspired people to drive their cars into crowds of BLM protesters or [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=285.12s)]
*  bring their assault rifles there and start shooting people? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=290.64s)]
*  Because we've had multiple instances of that and I don't think those people would have just, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=294.16s)]
*  there's no world in which they didn't do that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=297.12s)]
*  And there was certainly a lot of content inspiring them to do that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=298.88s)]
*  Why is it that a guy broke into Nancy Pelosi's home and tried to kidnap her and cracked her [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=302.8s)]
*  husband's skull open? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=307.6s)]
*  Who is it that in the lead up to that was posting about how Nancy Pelosi is evil and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=309.2s)]
*  something needs to be done? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=313.52s)]
*  Again, I don't think you should go to jail for doing that, but evidently that's the position [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=314.8s)]
*  of Elon Musk and maybe MAGA as of right now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=319.68s)]
*  Yeah, so he says the real problem are the people criticizing Tesla. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=321.92s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  The real problem are the people who are doing crimes. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=330.72s)]
*  So you got a guy burning up a Tesla, arrest him, charge him with arson and whatever else [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=334.24s)]
*  you got, okay? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=339.04s)]
*  That makes sense that it applies to that crime. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=339.68s)]
*  Okay, somebody's doing a death threat, arrest them, find the guy, etc. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  By the way, while you're at it, come help us too, okay? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=345.6s)]
*  I know the elites get special privileges and we just gotta stay out here and get swatted [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=348.88s)]
*  and all that stuff. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=353.84s)]
*  But anyway, you wanna prevent crime, I'm legendarily for it, okay? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=354.64s)]
*  I'm taking a lot of critique for being anti-crime, okay? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=359.44s)]
*  So let's go get the criminals. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=362.64s)]
*  No, the people criticizing your product are not responsible for that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=364.8s)]
*  So if we play this game to John's point, we can round everybody up. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=369.84s)]
*  You're responsible for a right-winger sending pipe bombs. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=374.24s)]
*  You're responsible for January 6th. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=377.76s)]
*  You're responsible for a Tesla burning. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=380.08s)]
*  You're responsible for the Bernie Sanders, one Bernie Sanders supporter, whoever did [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=382.0s)]
*  violence, right? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=386.24s)]
*  Etc, etc. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=387.28s)]
*  And then next thing you know, we're all locked up. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  We're all terrorists, right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=389.76s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=391.44s)]
*  You're not gonna take away our speech rights. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=392.8s)]
*  I mean, this is so ironic. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=394.8s)]
*  This is the guy who claimed to be a free speech absolutist. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=396.64s)]
*  He had to take over Twitter because they were taking away free speech. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  Now he's like, real problem is people criticizing my company. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=402.64s)]
*  Today, I've got the president who I purchased working around the clock to help arrest anyone [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=406.24s)]
*  who criticizes my corporation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  That's the real problem, is it? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=415.52s)]
*  Is it? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=417.36s)]
*  No, I think the real problem is that you're a giant liar and hypocrite who never meant [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=418.0s)]
*  anything about free speech. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=424.08s)]
*  Look, our poll question in the live chat is, is Elon Musk a free speech absolutist? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=425.52s)]
*  I'm curious if you're like, people in the middle watch, people that run a right-wing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=430.8s)]
*  watch, Monday through Friday, 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock Eastern, come watch along with us, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=435.36s)]
*  be part of the show. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=441.04s)]
*  12% think, yeah, he's a free speech absolutist. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=442.0s)]
*  I mean, of course you should arrest anyone criticizing Tesla. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=444.48s)]
*  I mean, that's not free speech. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's protesting a corporation. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  You're crazy, dog. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=454.24s)]
*  Okay, and here's one thing I know about the right wing, though. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=455.76s)]
*  They do not want any products burned or smashed or shot at, unless it's Nike or [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=462.72s)]
*  Keurig or Bud Light, in which case you should shoot the living crap out of it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=472.88000000000005s)]
*  You should burn it, you should smash it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  And so, but Tesla, do you arrest them? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=481.04s)]
*  That's a product, that's a product of a corporation. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  You're gonna arrest everyone who suggested it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=488.56s)]
*  Should we round up everyone who smashed those things on the right? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  Of course not, because we're not hypocrites. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=494.72s)]
*  We actually believe in freedom of speech. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=497.36s)]
*  Finally, why do we say those weird things about, who's funding this? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=499.36s)]
*  Dude, if you're talking about the radicals who are actually doing the fires and who [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=506.56s)]
*  encourage them, there's nobody funding that. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  The most outer edge radicals in America, nope. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  You think that other billionaires are gonna find fun radicals that destroy corporations? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=519.44s)]
*  This is, it's so maniacal. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=526.72s)]
*  So why is it even in his head? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=529.36s)]
*  Because projection, because what does Elon Musk do? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  I've found Donald Trump and then he puts me in charge of the government, so I assume others [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=533.36s)]
*  are doing it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=538.64s)]
*  And this is just propaganda. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=540.16s)]
*  And I bought X for free speech abs-ism. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=543.28s)]
*  Or maybe you bought it for propaganda and that's why you assume everybody's doing what [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  you're doing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=550.88s)]
*  Yeah, the irony and the tone deafness is just crazy on this guy. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=551.5999999999999s)]
*  When he's saying the people who are inspiring these things should be the ones held accountable. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=556.88s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump famously on January 6 said, go down to the Capitol and let's win [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=563.52s)]
*  back our democracy. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=570.16s)]
*  I mean, he straight up said it and then those guys went. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  So hello. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's what that guy does. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=575.36s)]
*  And then when he says, I've been getting death threats, Donald Trump says the people on the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=576.96s)]
*  committee, the January 6 committee are people that people should go after. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  So you see Eric Swalwell, you see Jamie Raskin, you see all these members of that committee [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=587.6s)]
*  constantly getting death threats from Trump supporters. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=593.44s)]
*  So if you wanna point at somebody who's causing a lot of violence and threats of violence, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=597.28s)]
*  and threats of violence, maybe he should talk to his buddy over there, as well as himself, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=602.8000000000001s)]
*  like you guys just pointed out. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=607.44s)]
*  The other thing is, Bond villains and Lex Luthor, Gene Hackman, RIP, they at least had [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=609.36s)]
*  the decency to admit they were villains. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  This guy's pretending not to be a villain. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=621.52s)]
*  I mean, he's clearly a villain. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=623.2s)]
*  You're the villain. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=625.2s)]
*  Like just own it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=626.0s)]
*  Be like, look, I'm a villain and people don't like me and that's why they're burning the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=627.28s)]
*  Teslas. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=631.2s)]
*  But I don't care because I have so much money. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=632.4000000000001s)]
*  I really don't care. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=635.36s)]
*  Admit it as opposed to trying to play this guy who's like, I don't know what's going on. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=637.84s)]
*  Why don't they like this? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=641.9200000000001s)]
*  You know what it is? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  It's propaganda against Teslas. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  Now, let me tell you one last thing. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=646.32s)]
*  I am a Tesla owner and I regret owning a Tesla right now. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=648.1600000000001s)]
*  I bought it before all this crap started. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=653.44s)]
*  I didn't buy it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=655.76s)]
*  I leased it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=656.32s)]
*  I'm trying to get out of it, but they charge you an arm or leg to get out of the lease. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=657.12s)]
*  And I will tell you right now, first hand, that I am not upset at the car itself because [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=660.88s)]
*  of some propaganda that's been fed to me. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=670.0s)]
*  I'm not saying this actually is a good car, but the problem is this guy. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=672.32s)]
*  So every time I'm in the car, I just feel like, oh my God, what's he going to say next? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=678.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=683.84s)]
*  I feel apologetic. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=684.4s)]
*  I pull up at the lights all the time. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=685.2s)]
*  I'm apologetic. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=686.72s)]
*  When he was doing the Nazi salute, I was like, what do I? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=687.92s)]
*  I got to apologize for that? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=690.32s)]
*  He's a disaster and he's completely tone deaf. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  And then people make excuses. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  Supporters of his make excuses to go, well, he's on the spectrum. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=698.08s)]
*  Well, he better get off the spectrum because at least admit that you are the problem. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=700.96s)]
*  That's it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=709.5200000000001s)]
*  Being on the spectrum is not an excuse to be like, oh, I'm clueless to the fact that [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=710.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm the cause of all these problems. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=714.72s)]
*  And all of that to say once again, John said it a few times, no one advocates violence [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=718.4s)]
*  or burning anything or any of that stuff. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=725.76s)]
*  However, these folks are the same folks who inspired all those things that John had said. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=728.64s)]
*  January 6th, he continues to do things like that that causes threats of violence towards [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=735.36s)]
*  others. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=740.72s)]
*  And the fact that he's not admitting, the fact that he's sitting there with a straight face, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=741.36s)]
*  the fact that Brett Baer doesn't just laugh and go, are you being serious? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=744.72s)]
*  That would have been great. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=749.12s)]
*  If Brett Baer would have been like, come on, no, really, you know, it's you, right? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=749.84s)]
*  It's you. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=753.76s)]
*  You're the cause. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=754.96s)]
*  You don't know that? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=755.84s)]
*  Like what kind of genius are you that you're and I think, John, you made that point. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=757.36s)]
*  I think he's just an insincere, narcissistic, megalomaniac who is not to be trusted. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=762.1600000000001s)]
*  And I just want to get rid of my Tesla. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  Somebody help me get rid of it, please. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=773.52s)]
*  So, buy it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=775.12s)]
*  Mazda's forcing me to make the last couple of points. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  Number one, we'll prove to you that we really, really don't want you to burn Teslas. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=778.72s)]
*  It might be Mazda's car, so don't burn it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=782.88s)]
*  Okay, all right, so that's point one. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  Point two is, you said he's like the villain, right? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=787.76s)]
*  He literally came out in a chainsaw, right? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=792.0s)]
*  He's like out of a Halloween movie. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=795.36s)]
*  And they're like, nope, I don't see it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=798.4s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=800.48s)]
*  And you want to talk about encouraging violence. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=801.84s)]
*  As they were breaking into the Capitol, we showed you the tape many times, they were [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=807.76s)]
*  chanting hang Mike Pence, hang Mike Pence. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=811.92s)]
*  And by the way, Trump was told about it and he said he deserves it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=817.12s)]
*  But political violence, what name saw? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=819.92s)]
*  The first time the right wing's ever heard about it is when a Tesla was attacked. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=823.6s)]
*  Okay, guys, we criticize Democrats all the time. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=827.84s)]
*  Try being consistent, try being principled to everyone. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=831.04s)]
*  Stop the tribes, stop the tribalism, and just be consistent for once. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=835.04s)]
*  So finally, and again, if you're right wing or you're in the middle or wherever you are, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=839.5999999999999s)]
*  remember, this is all in an effort to take away your rights. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=844.8s)]
*  Because once they stop anyone from criticizing Tesla, then they can stop you from criticizing [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=848.16s)]
*  any corporation or any donor or any politician. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=853.04s)]
*  So these Tesla fires have a little Reichstag fire energy to them. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=856.0s)]
*  Not because that they were set or lit by Elon or anyone on their side, no. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=861.36s)]
*  But because it's an excuse to take away your rights. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7Wv2Xqgi8&t=867.36s)]
