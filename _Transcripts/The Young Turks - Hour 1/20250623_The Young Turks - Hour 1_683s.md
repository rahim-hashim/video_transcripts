"A day after President Trump declared that Iran‚Äôs nuclear program had been ‚Äúcompletely and totally obliterated‚Äù by American bunker-busting bombs and a barrage of missiles, the actual state of the program seemed far more murky, with senior officials conceding they did not know the fate of Iran‚Äôs stockpile of near-bomb-grade uranium."

# Iran MOVED Uranium BEFORE Bombing, Sources Say
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4)
*  Is the United States now at war with Iran? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=0.0s)]
*  No, Kristen, we're not at war with Iran. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=3.04s)]
*  We're at war with Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Here is the Isfahan site before the bombing, and this is what it looks like now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=10.6s)]
*  So far, the International Atomic Energy Agency says it's seen no radiation leaking from the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=16.52s)]
*  sites. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=22.12s)]
*  And one possibility is that that's because the nuclear material might not have been there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=23.12s)]
*  There's a report this morning in the New York Times that Fordo, that deep underground enrichment [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=29.2s)]
*  facility was severely damaged but not fully destroyed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=34.28s)]
*  Severely damaged versus obliterated, I'm not exactly sure what the difference is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=39.28s)]
*  What we know is that the nuclear program backed substantially. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=43.12s)]
*  While the Trump administration is claiming that the US strikes on Iran's nuclear sites [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=46.84s)]
*  completely obliterated their nuclear program, there is some evidence that Iran may have [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=52.18s)]
*  moved the enriched uranium prior to the attack. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=57.56s)]
*  Now if that is proven to be the case, Trump kind of hinting at the fact that they were [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  going to bomb the nuclear sites might have had something to do with it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=66.8s)]
*  But nonetheless, some of this intel is coming from Israeli officials who shouldn't be trusted [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=70.0s)]
*  since they want a regime change war in Iran. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=75.84s)]
*  They do not want the United States to agree to a ceasefire. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=79.04s)]
*  Trump today announced on Truth Social that he managed to get a ceasefire agreement between [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=82.92s)]
*  Iran and Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=89.44s)]
*  We're gonna have to wait and see if that actually comes to fruition. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=90.84s)]
*  But nonetheless, there is some other evidence that Iran may have moved their enriched uranium. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=94.0s)]
*  So the 60% enriched fuel had been stored deep inside the Isfahan nuclear facility or nuclear [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=99.66s)]
*  complex. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  Rafael Mariano Grossi, the Director General of the IAEA, that's the International Atomic [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=109.52s)]
*  Energy Agency, said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that Iran has made no secret that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=115.56s)]
*  they have protected this material. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=121.8s)]
*  Asked later in the day whether he meant that the fuel stockpile, which is stored in special [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=124.44s)]
*  casks small enough to fit in the trunks of about 10 cars, had been moved. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=130.76s)]
*  He replied, I do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=136.8s)]
*  And there's some additional evidence as well that I wanna share with you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=139.08s)]
*  So for instance, satellite images released by Maxar Technologies at the tunnels leading [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=142.0s)]
*  into the Fordow Mountain taken in the days before the American strike show 16 cargo trucks [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=148.72000000000003s)]
*  positioned near an entrance. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=154.8s)]
*  An analyst or analysis by the Open Source Center in London suggested that Iran may have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=157.24s)]
*  been preparing the site for a strike. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=162.5s)]
*  Now Vice President JD Vance weighed in on this when asked about it over the weekend. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=166.24s)]
*  Let's take a quick look at what he had to say. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=170.84s)]
*  The UN's Atomic Energy Watchdog said that Iran had 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=172.44s)]
*  Do we know what has become of that? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=181.52s)]
*  Was it destroyed in this attack? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Do we know? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=185.0s)]
*  As a big stockpile- [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=186.0s)]
*  We're gonna work in the coming weeks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=187.0s)]
*  Yeah, John, we're gonna work in the coming weeks to ensure that we do something with [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=189.52s)]
*  that fuel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  That's one of the things that we're gonna have conversations with the Iranians about. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=195.16s)]
*  But what we know, John, is they no longer have the capacity to turn that stockpile of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=198.56s)]
*  highly enriched uranium to weapons-grade uranium. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=202.76s)]
*  And that was really the goal here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  Uranium is not that difficult to come by, John, but enriching uranium up to the point [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=208.5s)]
*  of a nuclear weapon, that is what the president put a stop to last night. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=212.9s)]
*  So right now you have experts within the Pentagon trying to assess how much damage was actually [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=217.5s)]
*  done to the nuclear sites. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=222.82s)]
*  But keep in mind, they did use 30,000 pound Buster Bunker bombs. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=225.14s)]
*  Bunker Buster bombs. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=230.66s)]
*  What did I say? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=231.66s)]
*  Buster bunkers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=232.66s)]
*  That's hilarious, okay. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=233.66s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=234.66s)]
*  So those bombs do serious damage, and we're the only ones who have those bombs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=236.06s)]
*  So look, I don't know, we're gonna have to wait and see. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=240.74s)]
*  But I'm worried that this is gonna be used as an excuse to keep goading the United States [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=242.82s)]
*  to go to war with Iran. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so they wanna have it both ways. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  So on the one hand, they wanna say, we obliterated them, we're awesome and strong. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=250.76s)]
*  On the other hand, they wanna say, well, they're not obliterated cuz we wanna keep fighting. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=257.08s)]
*  So if Israel doesn't use the excuse of, well, they moved some of them, so not good enough, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  we have to keep going to war, I will be shocked. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=267.21999999999997s)]
*  What does that remind you of? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=270.36s)]
*  Exactly what they did in Gaza, where they said, we've killed all of Hamas's leaders, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=271.8s)]
*  so we're awesome and strong. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=276.2s)]
*  But not everyone in Hamas is dead, so we have to keep going, okay? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=278.7s)]
*  The Israeli war machine always has to keep going to do self-defense, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  So they always have a new reason to bomb, a new reason to kill, a new reason to take [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=290.88s)]
*  new land, a new reason to topple a nearby country's government, okay? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=294.6s)]
*  All for self-defense, okay? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=299.76s)]
*  So no, they're just gonna use it as an, by the way, I don't believe a word coming out [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=303.22s)]
*  of American or Israeli intelligence going forward about whatever uranium they might [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=307.92s)]
*  or might not have left. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=313.16s)]
*  Because I guarantee you, it'll be propaganda depending on what they want. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=314.92s)]
*  In the rare case that this Donald Trump ceasefire holds, and the US intelligence and the Trump [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=318.68s)]
*  administration wants you to believe that it's totally obliterated, whether they are or not, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=324.92s)]
*  they will insist we got rid of all of it, right? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=329.36s)]
*  That is much less likely. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=331.72s)]
*  What is much more likely is Israel, and then hence, of course, by definition, America, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=333.2s)]
*  will then come back around and go, no, we didn't get it all. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=338.92s)]
*  No, we got those 10 vials over there and 20 vials over there. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=341.44s)]
*  And we can't get it all until we keep bombing and bombing and regime change and more war [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=344.76s)]
*  for self-defense. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  Yep, so let's talk about diplomacy because that was really the only way to ensure that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=351.64s)]
*  Iran was not enriching uranium or racing toward basically being able to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=359.68s)]
*  So again, diplomacy has been the most successful way of ensuring that we don't have proliferation [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=366.24s)]
*  of nuclear weapons. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=373.34s)]
*  The Iran nuclear deal of 2015 obviously is a good example of that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=375.08s)]
*  In fact, more than 15 years ago, the joint US-Israeli attack on Natanz using a sophisticated [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  cyber weapon caused about a fifth of the country's 5,000 or so centrifuges to blow up. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=385.32s)]
*  And that didn't work, did it? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=392.36s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=395.64s)]
*  It wasn't until you had the nuclear deal where you have inspectors going into Iran to ensure [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=396.64s)]
*  that they're not enriching uranium to the point where they can build the nuclear weapons. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=403.0s)]
*  You have checks baked into that system to ensure that people are safe. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  We're not having weapons that are gonna cause mass destruction, but Trump ripped that up. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=412.36s)]
*  And if he hadn't ripped that up, we wouldn't find ourselves in the position that this country [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=418.12s)]
*  is in at this current moment. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so that's so important. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=423.32s)]
*  And he could have gotten back into the deal and just called it the Trump deal. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=425.08s)]
*  And he could have changed one or two lines and it wouldn't have mattered. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=428.86s)]
*  And if he wanted to brag about it, that would infuriate me, but I'd say, hey, a lot better [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=431.4s)]
*  than war. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=435.08s)]
*  Okay, yeah, get back into the deal, right? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=436.08s)]
*  But why that's so important, guys, is because in American media, they constantly lie to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=438.52s)]
*  you on purpose and frame it so that it only appears that there are two choices. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=444.64s)]
*  Either Iran gets a nuclear weapon, and my God, they would obviously immediately use [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=450.68s)]
*  it cuz they're irrational, dirty, savage Muslims. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  So the minute they have a new kid, press the button right away, just like Pakistan. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=460.32s)]
*  All right, they didn't do it in Pakistan, but it doesn't matter, dirty Muslims. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  Dirty, dirty, dirty Muslims. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  They will definitely get a nuke and they will definitely nuke us, except they don't have [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=470.56s)]
*  a nuke, you're goddamn lying. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=474.08s)]
*  And there's a third choice. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=475.84s)]
*  So they say, either we're gonna get nuked or we're gonna go to war. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=477.24s)]
*  Or you get into a peace treaty that they were already in where they gave away all their [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=480.88s)]
*  uranium. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=485.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=486.76s)]
*  And they never tell you that option cuz they want you to go to war, cuz it's a propaganda [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=487.76s)]
*  machine. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=492.8s)]
*  They're not doing news, they're doing marketing for the powerful. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=493.8s)]
*  All right, now somebody wrote in here and I gotta read it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=497.08000000000004s)]
*  It's one of our members and it's a great point. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=499.48s)]
*  Member on tyt.com. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  Wandering Puerto Rican wrote in, wait, they moved the uranium. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=504.72s)]
*  Doesn't that sound just like that they moved the WMD from where we thought they were at? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=508.64000000000004s)]
*  Jesus Christ, the media is spinning the same crap from the Iraq days, bingo. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  You remember when Rumsfeld said, no, we know where the weapons of mass destruction are. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=517.76s)]
*  They're to the north and south and east and west of Tikrit. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=521.92s)]
*  Oops, they were none of those places. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=526.1999999999999s)]
*  And Rumsfeld didn't know he was lying on behalf of Israel. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=529.7199999999999s)]
*  We had nothing to do with Iraq. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=533.16s)]
*  They did not attack us. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=535.28s)]
*  In fact, they were opposed to al-Qaeda. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=536.56s)]
*  They were opposed to the people who attacked us. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=538.4799999999999s)]
*  But Israel wanted Iraq toppled. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=542.9599999999999s)]
*  And now they want Iran toppled. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=545.36s)]
*  Same exact thing. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  Weapons of mass destruction. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=548.4399999999999s)]
*  We couldn't find them. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=550.28s)]
*  They were moved. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=551.8s)]
*  Now we're doing regime change and off you go to die and pay for all of our wars. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=552.88s)]
*  But okay, Trump claims there's a ceasefire and this is all going to be that Israel gets [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=558.52s)]
*  a bomb for 24 more hours, kill as many civilians as they like. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=563.12s)]
*  Do any bombing they like because they're above the law. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=567.4799999999999s)]
*  No international law applies to the great beloved moral Israel. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=569.76s)]
*  They can violate every law, every convention. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=573.7199999999999s)]
*  They can murder as many civilians as they like. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=576.4s)]
*  But they're the most moral army doing self-defense, right? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=578.58s)]
*  So okay, let's see what happens after the 24 hours. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=582.98s)]
*  But I would be shocked if Netanyahu didn't grab Trump like this and just yank him right [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=585.86s)]
*  back into the war. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=592.14s)]
*  And Trump being an idiot and a sucker will be like, I'm gonna be strong Netanyahu. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=593.5s)]
*  You know why we went, he did the bombing? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=597.9000000000001s)]
*  He saw on Fox News that they were bragging about what a brilliant and strong mission [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=600.26s)]
*  Israel had done in bombing Iran. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=604.98s)]
*  And that moron was like, I could be more brilliant and stronger. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=607.54s)]
*  I could bomb Iran too. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=610.8199999999999s)]
*  And they had wall to wall propaganda on Fox News because they know the moron only watches [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=612.5799999999999s)]
*  Fox News. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=616.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=617.3s)]
*  So it's gonna be so easy to hoodwink that orange buffoon into a further war, but maybe [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=618.3s)]
*  I'm wrong. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=625.26s)]
*  I hope you are. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=626.26s)]
*  I hope I'm wrong. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=627.26s)]
*  I hope what he announced today is actually true and that both parties actually follow [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=628.26s)]
*  through with the alleged ceasefire. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=632.98s)]
*  I wanna be proven wrong so badly. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=635.4200000000001s)]
*  But honestly so far, I haven't been proven wrong. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=638.26s)]
*  Everything I predicted ended up coming true. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=641.6600000000001s)]
*  Adam Sosnick, the guy who threw the tampon at me as we were debating. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=644.1800000000001s)]
*  The reason why he did it is because I predicted accurately that the United States would get [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=647.86s)]
*  dragged into this war, that we would pay for the bombs. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=652.34s)]
*  By the way, you think Israel paid for those bunker buster bombs? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=654.94s)]
*  I think we spent 60 billion total for those bombs. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=658.9s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=663.42s)]
*  I'll have to look that up. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=664.42s)]
*  No one's asking how much those bombs cost. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=665.42s)]
*  No, no, no, for Israel. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=667.3s)]
*  Israel first, okay? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=670.34s)]
*  So that's what all the magazine, right? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=671.34s)]
*  Israel first. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=673.82s)]
*  America 28th. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tlL1FKtYM4&t=674.82s)]
