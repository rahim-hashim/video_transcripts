"A new Quinnipiac University poll gives Donald Trump poor ratings on trade, immigration and efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Political commentators credited Trump‚Äôs stance on immigration for winning back the White House, although others cited voter concerns about inflation. The poll shows Americans support admitting international students and maintaining birthright citizenship and may be wearying of the president‚Äôs mass deportation policies."

# Is Trump's Plan BACKFIRING?!?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw)
*  Right before we came on air, there was a new Quinnipiac poll that was released. So Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump negative 12 on approval in general, negative 11 on immigration and negative 16 on deportations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=4.32s)]
*  Well, Americans are not just giving President Donald Trump low marks on his signature policies, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=11.28s)]
*  but on his approval rating overall. And that's according to a new Quinnipiac poll that I wanna [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=19.68s)]
*  get into and I wanna break down. So Trump has received consistently high approval ratings on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=26.4s)]
*  his immigration policies during his second term. We've been covering that quite a bit, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=32.56s)]
*  but it looks like we are now experiencing a turn. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=37.68s)]
*  Because according to this poll, he's losing favorability when it comes to his immigration [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=41.76s)]
*  policies. It might have something to do with the ICE raids that target people at Home Depot parking [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=47.76s)]
*  lots, day laborers are trying to make an honest living. Or when ICE goes into a church to arrest [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=52.88s)]
*  a suspected undocumented immigrant, that kind of stuff, kind of starts to turn people off. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=59.36s)]
*  And so Quinnipiac found that when it comes to Trump's handling of immigration issues, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=64.48s)]
*  only 43% approved, 54% disapprove, and 3% offered no opinion. And to be honest with you, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=69.6s)]
*  it makes me curious if polls like this and the public sentiment kind of turning on Trump's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=79.2s)]
*  immigration policies is what incentivized him to post something today on social media about how, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  our farmers are saying that it's not good that we're doing these raids, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=93.28s)]
*  and maybe we need to scale them back a little bit. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=96.64s)]
*  We'll see if they're actually scaled back, but Trump knows what he's doing. Steven Miller is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=99.92s)]
*  the one who ordered ICE to essentially target low hanging fruit as it pertains to undocumented [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=104.48s)]
*  immigrants. It's very easy to find day laborers in a Home Depot parking lot. And the reason why [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=110.48s)]
*  he ordered them to do that is because they want to increase their deportation numbers. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=115.76s)]
*  They're in an imaginary competition with the Obama administration. It's ridiculous, but okay, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=118.72s)]
*  let's give you some more. When it comes to Trump's handling of deportations, well, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=124.48s)]
*  how does the public feel about that? Only 40% approved, 56% disapprove, 4% offered no opinion. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=129.68s)]
*  So his numbers on the issue of deportations were even worse with 16% of respondents [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=138.72s)]
*  disapproving than approving, or 16% more, I should say, respondents disapproving than approving. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=146.16s)]
*  And then in the Quinnipiac poll, Trump got low scores across the board, including on issues [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=153.52s)]
*  like the economy, trade, the Russia-Ukraine war for obvious reasons, and the Israel-Gaza war. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=159.12s)]
*  I would like to think for obvious reasons. I mean, he hasn't really inspired much confidence [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=167.84s)]
*  lately when it comes to preventing a war with Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=174.56s)]
*  And also, let's not forget that Palestinians are getting slaughtered at an insane clip [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=180.0s)]
*  every single day, children, women, elderly people. Americans tend to not like that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  So when they see those images, I'm guessing they're not really appreciating how the Trump [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=191.84s)]
*  administration is failing to stop the carnage. And remember, he's the one who wants to make [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=195.36s)]
*  Gaza the Riviera of the Middle East, meaning he would like to steal that land from the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Palestinian people and build hotels, a resort community, absolutely pathetic. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=205.68s)]
*  Now, unsurprisingly, Trump's overall approval rating came out pretty low as well. 38% of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  Americans disapprove of the job he's doing so far. I'm sorry, 38% approve, 54% disapprove, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=219.84s)]
*  and 8% offered no opinion. So look, Americans are paying attention. That gives me a little [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  bit of hope for the future of this country. Because quite frankly, some of the targeted [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=237.6s)]
*  raids that have been taking place across the country, the types of people who are getting [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=243.12s)]
*  arrested, the way in which they're getting arrested in front of their children, inside their churches, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  at their workplaces. Yeah, it's upsetting a lot of people, not just in LA, not just in blue states, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  but across the country. When he said that he was gonna target criminals, people believed him. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=260.08s)]
*  And maybe that's the number one mistake, ever believing that this guy is telling the truth. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVxqpD59Lw&t=266.4s)]
