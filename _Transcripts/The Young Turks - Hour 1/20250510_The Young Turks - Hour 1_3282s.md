**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA)
*  Drop it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome one and all to not [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2.0s)]
*  technically a power panel, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=17.76s)]
*  I'm going to keep it real, but [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=20.12s)]
*  powerful in its own right. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=22.3s)]
*  Because it's just us two, me, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=24.34s)]
*  Johnny Rola, Mark Thompson, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=26.34s)]
*  legendary friend of the show, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=28.38s)]
*  host as well, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=30.14s)]
*  which we'll talk about. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=30.86s)]
*  We're here, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=32.18s)]
*  we're at the table together. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=32.94s)]
*  Yeah, which is really cool. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=34.379999999999995s)]
*  Normally it's kind of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=35.22s)]
*  a virtual interaction. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, is that more powerful than [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=36.94s)]
*  three people remotely talking? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=38.94s)]
*  I think so. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=40.7s)]
*  I think that you're right to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=41.42s)]
*  point it out, Johnny. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  I think that the table duo is very, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=43.82s)]
*  very powerful indeed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=45.9s)]
*  It's just strange to be able to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=47.739999999999995s)]
*  look and see you, but [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=49.28s)]
*  you're joining us here today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=50.3s)]
*  We did want to talk about [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  your show. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=53.58s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to talk about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=54.54s)]
*  it, but it's good that you mention [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  it because when you're in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=57.099999999999994s)]
*  the world of the YouTube podcast [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=58.22s)]
*  universe, you're always challenged [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=59.98s)]
*  and trying to get the word out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=61.78s)]
*  So I appreciate it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=62.98s)]
*  We've got a lot of the TYT family [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=63.7s)]
*  that does come over to my show. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=65.14s)]
*  My show is called [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=66.3s)]
*  The Mark Thompson Show. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=66.86s)]
*  It comes from, we didn't spend [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=68.62s)]
*  a long time on the title, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=70.18s)]
*  I'll give you that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=71.42s)]
*  We came from radio and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=72.78s)]
*  that's what the show was called [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=73.78s)]
*  on radio. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=75.02s)]
*  And then when the radio station up [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=75.7s)]
*  in the Bay Area went away, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=77.06s)]
*  we just brought the show to YouTube [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=78.34s)]
*  but we just kept the same name. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=79.82s)]
*  So a lot of our same radio [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=80.98s)]
*  listeners are there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=82.26s)]
*  A lot of YouTube folks who come to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=83.14s)]
*  TYT are with us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=85.58s)]
*  And I'd love for you to join us. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=87.38000000000001s)]
*  We're a live show two to four in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=89.14s)]
*  the east, 11 to one in the west [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  every day. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=92.38000000000001s)]
*  And we do a lot of what TYT does [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  with analysis and I think it's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=95.22s)]
*  a as you seek independent media for [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  analysis and different takes and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=99.86s)]
*  some clarity on issues. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=102.26s)]
*  I'd love for you to check it out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=104.06s)]
*  So it's called [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  The Mark Thompson Show. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  Please subscribe, check it out and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=106.14s)]
*  support, appreciate that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=107.82000000000001s)]
*  Awesome, awesome, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=108.98s)]
*  available on YouTube. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=110.02000000000001s)]
*  And well, if you're not familiar [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=111.26s)]
*  with Mark, which would be weird, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=113.18s)]
*  you should be. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=115.26s)]
*  He's been joining us for a while. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  We're going to give you a little [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=117.9s)]
*  taste of his commentary as we [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=119.3s)]
*  address a lot of important and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=120.62s)]
*  pressing topics across the economy [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=122.14s)]
*  and foreign policy, your rights. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=124.1s)]
*  Which I've always felt like it's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=125.9s)]
*  hard as an American to memorize all [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=127.9s)]
*  my rights because there used to be [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=129.94s)]
*  a lot of them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=131.94s)]
*  But it's getting more achievable [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=132.78s)]
*  recently as they're stripped away. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=134.58s)]
*  So that's a good thing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=136.34s)]
*  We've got immigration and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=137.78s)]
*  a whole lot more. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=139.5s)]
*  So buckle up, get ready for it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=140.7s)]
*  We're going to jump into our first [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=143.06s)]
*  topic starting with this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=144.14s)]
*  There are 18 very important trading [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=145.78s)]
*  relationships. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=148.82s)]
*  We are currently negotiating with [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=150.5s)]
*  17 of those trading partners. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  China, we have not engaged in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=156.58s)]
*  negotiations with as of yet. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=158.66s)]
*  So that is Scott Besant detailing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=162.06s)]
*  that there are negotiations ongoing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=163.98s)]
*  with some of America's main [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=166.14s)]
*  trading partners, but [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=167.74s)]
*  not one of them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=169.06s)]
*  The most important one, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=170.34s)]
*  that being China. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=171.46s)]
*  And obviously there, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=172.22s)]
*  he's uncomfortable revealing that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=173.62s)]
*  Partly because I've literally never [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=175.86s)]
*  seen him feel comfortable. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=177.5s)]
*  Not once ever has he looked like [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=179.02s)]
*  he's comfortable in his own skin. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=180.54000000000002s)]
*  But in particular, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=182.5s)]
*  when he's revealing that, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=183.34s)]
*  Donald Trump's been lying. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  We're not actually actively [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=185.82000000000002s)]
*  negotiating with China. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  They haven't bowed down to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=188.34s)]
*  the massive terrorists that we put [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=189.62s)]
*  on them that might not be received [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  well by Donald Trump. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=193.06s)]
*  And so maybe he's uncomfortable [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=195.10000000000002s)]
*  about that too. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=196.66000000000003s)]
*  But now we have a development, okay? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  Maybe there's movement towards not [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=200.34s)]
*  a normalization of relationships, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=202.34s)]
*  but at least going in that direction. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=204.34s)]
*  Trump posted this on True Social, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=206.18s)]
*  80% tariff on China seems right, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=208.34s)]
*  up to Scott B. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=210.72s)]
*  In other words, not my problem, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=212.02s)]
*  what am I, the president or [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  something, it's up to him. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=216.02s)]
*  So if it works, fine, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=217.86s)]
*  I'll take credit. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=219.3s)]
*  If it doesn't, it's on him. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=220.5s)]
*  If our economy or consumers suffer [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=223.38000000000002s)]
*  terrible financial damage, hey, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=225.3s)]
*  it's always been Scottie B this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=227.3s)]
*  entire time. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=229.06s)]
*  And so, look, maybe Scott Besant [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  will be able to work something out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=231.7s)]
*  He's going to be meeting with [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=233.06s)]
*  an economic representative of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=234.42s)]
*  China in Geneva sometime this [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=235.82s)]
*  weekend. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=237.38s)]
*  And so that means that maybe talks [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=237.9s)]
*  will begin, but Besant is also [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=239.9s)]
*  kind of, I think, trying to moderate [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=241.62s)]
*  people's expectations going into [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=243.82s)]
*  it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=245.9s)]
*  He said, my sense is that this will [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=246.4s)]
*  be about de-escalation, not about [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=248.5s)]
*  the big trade deal. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=250.74s)]
*  But we've got to de-escalate [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  before we move forward. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=253.46s)]
*  145% tariffs, 125% is the equivalent [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=254.9s)]
*  of an embargo. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=257.9s)]
*  We don't want to decouple what [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=259.9s)]
*  we want is fair trade. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=261.62s)]
*  And I just, because he seems a bit [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=263.41999999999996s)]
*  confused about how we got here, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=264.94s)]
*  I want to remind him, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=266.58s)]
*  Trump is the one that put those [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=267.62s)]
*  tariffs in, and trying to match [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=269.14s)]
*  them, true, which we said they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=270.62s)]
*  would. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=272.3s)]
*  You guys said, don't worry, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=273.38s)]
*  we're going to hurt them so bad [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=274.62s)]
*  that they'll back off. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=275.82s)]
*  Clearly, they're not doing that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  There is some indication that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  China is worried about the economic [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=279.26s)]
*  damage that would be done if this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  trade war continues for a long time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=282.18s)]
*  And they should be, trade wars are [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=284.18s)]
*  damaging in that way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=286.18s)]
*  But it's clear that Americans are [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=287.62s)]
*  also worried. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=289.9s)]
*  He's been slipping in the polls [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  when it comes to the economy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=292.54s)]
*  And so, I think maybe this signifies [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=293.42s)]
*  that Trump realizes that this has [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=296.38s)]
*  gotten out of hand. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=298.94s)]
*  He's not in control of it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  And so, maybe they will dial back [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  these tariffs a little bit, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=304.18s)]
*  because they're pretty bad. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this reminds me of the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=306.86s)]
*  meeting that he had with Zelensky [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=307.98s)]
*  when he was criticizing Zelensky [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=309.42s)]
*  about the power of his hand, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=310.86s)]
*  you're overplaying your hand. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=312.3s)]
*  Trump overplayed a hand that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=314.26s)]
*  didn't need to be played at all [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=315.66s)]
*  when it came to tariffs. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=317.1s)]
*  So you're exactly right, John, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=318.3s)]
*  when you suggest clearly there's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=319.66s)]
*  a flawing here, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=321.22s)]
*  a realization on Trump's part. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=322.06s)]
*  My God, these guys aren't coming [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  to the table. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=325.26000000000005s)]
*  And he was representing that China [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=326.18s)]
*  was calling the entire time that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=327.98s)]
*  there are sort of these backroom [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=329.74s)]
*  negotiations or backline [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=331.5s)]
*  negotiations when they weren't [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=332.94000000000005s)]
*  going on. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=334.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, the Chinese culturally [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  don't respond to this kind of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=337.5s)]
*  smack talking in your face, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=339.26000000000005s)]
*  ridiculous terror in position. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=341.06s)]
*  So now you're seeing the US in [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=343.62s)]
*  the form of Besant beginning to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=345.94000000000005s)]
*  back it down and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=348.54s)]
*  try to get them to the table. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=350.26s)]
*  And maybe they'll make some kind [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=351.7s)]
*  of moderate deal in Geneva. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=353.34s)]
*  The problem is you have to make [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=354.82s)]
*  a big deal, I mean, from 146 to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=356.5s)]
*  where to get us into any kind of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=358.38s)]
*  reasonable trading situation. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=360.05999999999995s)]
*  I know that you're going to touch [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=361.94s)]
*  on the percentages. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=363.29999999999995s)]
*  Because they're shocking. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=364.34s)]
*  I mean, it really is an embargo [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=365.21999999999997s)]
*  right now and you'll have to get [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=366.94s)]
*  to a much, much, much lower number [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=368.73999999999995s)]
*  for this even to be playable. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=370.82s)]
*  Yeah, and while Trump in that first [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=372.7s)]
*  true social post that we showed [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=374.7s)]
*  you is like, hey, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=376.5s)]
*  maybe this is reasonable. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  But again, it's not really me. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=379.06s)]
*  80% is that that's still insane. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=380.62s)]
*  That's utterly like imagine [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=383.14s)]
*  whatever you bought recently from [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=384.5s)]
*  China, which is probably most of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=386.18s)]
*  the things you've bought 80% over [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=387.86s)]
*  and above what you would have paid [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=389.58s)]
*  three months ago purely because [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=391.26s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't understand [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=392.74s)]
*  how terrorists work, that sucks. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=394.42s)]
*  And also, it's effectively [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=396.38s)]
*  the same as 145. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=398.22s)]
*  Like at a certain point, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=399.5s)]
*  this is nonsense. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=400.9s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=401.98s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=403.38s)]
*  It's simply too much you wouldn't [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=404.18s)]
*  buy those products anymore. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=405.5s)]
*  But also more importantly, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=406.78s)]
*  you wouldn't even necessarily have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=408.18s)]
*  the opportunity to buy the products [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=409.62s)]
*  because they're not going to be [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=411.09999999999997s)]
*  available. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=412.34s)]
*  Companies, stores are not going to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=412.85999999999996s)]
*  be stocking these things, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=414.46s)]
*  whether they're 80% or 145%. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=415.68s)]
*  There is, let's see, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=417.5s)]
*  well on both sides of that, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=419.02s)]
*  we'll get to where we need to get [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=420.7s)]
*  that number down for at least [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  companies start to stock them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=424.06s)]
*  But even if tariffs went to 0% [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=425.97999999999996s)]
*  this weekend, according to CNN, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=427.85999999999996s)]
*  the US would still likely face in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=429.97999999999996s)]
*  the short term both price hikes and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=431.94s)]
*  shortages because for some time, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=434.02s)]
*  ships have not been coming into [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=436.54s)]
*  port, they haven't been delivering [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=437.94s)]
*  these products. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=439.7s)]
*  I think Caitlin Collins talked to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=440.5s)]
*  one of the port managers and said [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=442.06s)]
*  they didn't have a single ship. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=443.54s)]
*  And you don't fix that overnight. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=445.1s)]
*  That's just not how it works. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=447.14s)]
*  It feels like we're in the depths [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=448.18s)]
*  of the pandemic again. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=449.94s)]
*  But even so, let's say we get to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=451.46s)]
*  the 80%. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=453.14s)]
*  So they say even if tariffs fall to [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=454.02s)]
*  80%, it's not clear that that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=455.74s)]
*  would actually convince US [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=457.38s)]
*  businesses to import Chinese goods. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=458.9s)]
*  Economists have said 50% is [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=460.98s)]
*  the make or break threshold for [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=462.5s)]
*  somewhat normal businesses between [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=464.3s)]
*  the two countries. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=466.54s)]
*  That means that we would actually [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=467.94s)]
*  have access to the products. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=469.42s)]
*  But I want to remind everyone, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=470.66s)]
*  they'd still cost 50% more than [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=472.18s)]
*  they should otherwise. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=473.82s)]
*  And all of this again is still just [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  due to Donald Trump. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=477.42s)]
*  He decided to put us in this mess. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=479.3s)]
*  He doesn't want to take [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=481.46000000000004s)]
*  responsibility for it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=482.1s)]
*  Of course he's not, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=483.06s)]

*  That's why his poll numbers have [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=487.66s)]
*  been dropping. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=488.74s)]

*  don't like him. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=498.54s)]
*  And in terms of the tariffs in [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=499.90000000000003s)]
*  particular, new polling shows that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=501.5s)]
*  while Trump has been successful in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=503.5s)]

*  the tariffs, a lot of people do [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=509.26000000000005s)]
*  want to see that stuff. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=510.90000000000003s)]
*  Something like 61% of all Americans [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=512.1800000000001s)]
*  want businesses to label the tariff [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=514.26s)]

*  information. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=521.5s)]
*  Yeah, and these are strong arm [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=522.5s)]
*  tactics on the part of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=524.1s)]
*  the administration to sweat Amazon [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=525.14s)]

*  that they don't want to post what [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=528.64s)]
*  the tariffs are actually costing. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=530.54s)]
*  And if you're a small business to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=532.74s)]
*  John's point, I mean, the reason [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=534.38s)]
*  that there are barren shelves is [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=536.06s)]
*  because you can't order these items [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=537.86s)]
*  from China and pay these huge [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=539.94s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=541.66s)]
*  It's the businesses that are paying [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=542.2s)]
*  the tariffs initially and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=544.22s)]
*  then they have the option of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=545.78s)]
*  passing that on to the consumer. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=547.3s)]
*  But they can't even as you've [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=549.3s)]
*  described John with 146 or 80% pay [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=550.9s)]
*  these excruciating tariff rates. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=553.18s)]
*  So a lot of businesses may even [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=555.42s)]
*  fold in the face of all of this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=557.26s)]
*  Yeah, and there's word that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=559.3s)]
*  Chinese businesses are worried [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=560.78s)]
*  about that, that in the short term [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=562.3s)]
*  before they can pivot away from [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=564.02s)]
*  the US market to other markets that [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=565.5799999999999s)]
*  they could suffer some damage. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=567.26s)]
*  That's one of the calculations I [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=568.86s)]
*  think that Trump is making is that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=570.4599999999999s)]
*  maybe their economy will be [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=572.22s)]
*  destroyed before ours will. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=573.78s)]
*  But there is no guarantee of that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=575.42s)]
*  And also, someday if he decides to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=577.1s)]
*  just snap his fingers and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=579.02s)]
*  tariffs go back down to 30% or [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=580.54s)]
*  10% to 0% or whatever, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=582.38s)]
*  maybe he feels like he's gotten [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=583.74s)]
*  some sort of win. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=585.38s)]
*  He'll post on True Social about it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=586.46s)]
*  But our businesses that have closed [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=588.3s)]
*  down, they don't just get to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=589.98s)]
*  reopen thanks to that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=591.2s)]
*  People have lost their jobs. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=592.5s)]
*  They don't necessarily get those [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=594.14s)]
*  jobs back, certainly not in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=595.58s)]
*  the short term. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=596.7s)]
*  And so he's playing games, but [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=597.22s)]
*  I feel like we, including many of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=599.14s)]
*  his voters, are the pieces in that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=601.02s)]
*  game. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=602.94s)]
*  Yeah, and just to your point, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=603.46s)]
*  the snap of the fingers is actually [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=605.06s)]
*  a really good way to describe it, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=606.94s)]
*  because these are impulsive [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=608.6999999999999s)]
*  decisions that he's making on when [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=610.2199999999999s)]
*  to raise the tariff, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=611.9399999999999s)]
*  when to lower the tariff. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=612.9399999999999s)]
*  And then to your other point about [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=614.38s)]
*  his notion that somehow you're [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=616.38s)]
*  going to outpace the Chinese [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=618.18s)]
*  economy because you have [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=619.8199999999999s)]
*  the greatest leverage. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=621.3399999999999s)]
*  Already the Chinese economy is [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=623.02s)]
*  beginning to build relationships [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=624.8199999999999s)]
*  around the United States so [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=626.74s)]
*  that they no longer have to count [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=628.2199999999999s)]
*  on the United States. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=629.98s)]
*  Obviously, we're their biggest [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=631.18s)]
*  customer, but they can begin to [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=632.86s)]
*  develop other parts of the world. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=634.4599999999999s)]
*  And their economy's falling apart [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=636.26s)]
*  because he's far more durable in [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=638.5s)]
*  many ways than it is ours. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=640.38s)]
*  Yeah, and if they form those new [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=641.94s)]
*  partnerships, then maybe he snaps [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=643.78s)]
*  his fingers and maybe our economy [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=645.86s)]
*  doesn't recover. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=647.62s)]
*  Sure. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=648.62s)]
*  Because they don't necessarily [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=649.12s)]
*  need us, they don't focus on us [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=650.26s)]
*  anymore. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=651.54s)]
*  So again, he's making a lot of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=652.06s)]
*  risk to us. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=653.5s)]
*  It's astounding, Johnny, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=654.1s)]
*  that this guy inherited the best [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=655.62s)]
*  economy in the developed world and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=657.42s)]
*  that he could just tank it in [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=659.34s)]
*  the first 100 days. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=660.94s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=662.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, 100%. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=664.26s)]
*  Tariffs are a touchy subject for [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=665.38s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=668.3s)]
*  He could see the poll numbers, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=669.5s)]
*  he can see the stock market, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=671.34s)]
*  it's not going well. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=673.06s)]
*  And MSNBC did a little segment [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=674.3s)]
*  where they criticized the chaos [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=676.14s)]
*  over these tariffs and he was not [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=678.06s)]
*  at all happy about it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=679.9399999999999s)]
*  We'll give you his response, but [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=681.5s)]
*  first here's what MSNBC said. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=683.1s)]
*  With Donald Trump's [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=684.74s)]
*  policy of the world, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=686.1s)]
*  he's not going to be able to [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=687.42s)]
*  do anything about it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=689.2s)]
*  He's going to be able to do [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=690.94s)]
*  anything about it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=692.5s)]
*  With Donald Trump, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=694.62s)]
*  I still believe it's all showbiz. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=696.1s)]
*  It's all symbolism. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=699.66s)]
*  It's all getting to where he wants [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=701.54s)]
*  to get. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=703.98s)]
*  I just don't think the details [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=704.7s)]
*  right now matter, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=706.78s)]
*  especially if you look back six [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=708.1s)]
*  months from now, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=710.26s)]
*  this is the start of a symbolic [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=711.46s)]
*  process. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=713.54s)]
*  145%, as we've discussed, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=714.58s)]
*  is prohibitive. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=716.42s)]
*  By the way, 80% is prohibitive, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=717.54s)]
*  ultimately. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=719.74s)]
*  So all they're trying to do is [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=720.58s)]
*  create a thaw, if you will, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=722.62s)]
*  in what these negotiations [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=724.46s)]
*  even look like. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=726.4200000000001s)]
*  There may be a soft landing here [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=727.38s)]
*  with tariffs. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=729.46s)]
*  And I suspect it's because [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=730.74s)]
*  the alternative is so [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=732.46s)]

*  the details of a deal. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=901.9399999999999s)]

*  the network should be shut down or [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=908.74s)]
*  find out of existence. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=910.6999999999999s)]
*  That is his go to now when anyone [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=912.26s)]

*  should crush you under its thumb. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=916.66s)]
*  Well, he has, sadly, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=919.18s)]
*  the right constellation of people [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=920.74s)]
*  around him, Pam Bondi and Patel and [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=923.26s)]
*  others to fire up any kind of [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=925.74s)]
*  investigation that he wants. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=927.5s)]
*  So even this would sort of be [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=929.74s)]
*  an empty kind of threat under any [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=931.3000000000001s)]
*  other presidency. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=933.02s)]
*  But this time I kind of think to [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=933.94s)]
*  myself, well, he'll leverage [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=935.82s)]
*  the government and approvals of [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=937.74s)]

*  Paramount, etc. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=943.86s)]
*  Want and Disney. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=945.1s)]
*  And he can have a chilling effect [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=946.98s)]
*  on what they can say and [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=949.02s)]
*  what they will say. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=950.38s)]
*  So, I mean, it seems like it's just [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=951.66s)]
*  the mad king in the middle of [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=954.0600000000001s)]
*  the night flexing. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=955.9s)]
*  But the reality is he does, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=958.0600000000001s)]
*  when he posts this stuff, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=959.86s)]
*  he does have a sort of scary aspect [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=961.62s)]
*  to those things that he's demanding. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=963.54s)]
*  So we look at it and go, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=965.62s)]
*  what do you mean a campaign [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=966.62s)]
*  violation? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=967.78s)]
*  It's absurd, the whole thing is [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=968.5s)]
*  just utterly absurd. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=970.1s)]
*  But he's pursued these absurdities [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=971.26s)]
*  before in ways that have cost [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=973.9s)]
*  people jobs and have actually [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=976.0600000000001s)]
*  forced the settlement, for example, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=978.38s)]
*  the HBS case initially or [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=981.34s)]
*  the ABC case is an even better [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=982.94s)]
*  example because they tapped out so [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=984.7s)]

*  whine about it more. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1116.06s)]

*  And I am, if you couldn't tell, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1233.54s)]
*  I was being sarcastic there, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1235.54s)]
*  I am begging the media, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1237.42s)]
*  do not just run with this story [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1238.98s)]
*  when it runs directly counter to [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1240.94s)]
*  everything about Donald Trump and [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1243.62s)]
*  indeed the Republican Party that [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1245.5s)]
*  we've ever known for [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1247.3799999999999s)]
*  literally decades. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1248.54s)]
*  The idea that they're going to do [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1249.6599999999999s)]
*  this or at least if you're going to [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1251.3s)]
*  talk about it, talk about how [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1253.12s)]
*  utterly weak sauce it is. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1254.74s)]
*  First of all, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1256.7s)]
*  they're not going to do this. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1257.3s)]
*  But even if they did, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1258.7s)]
*  it's a couple percentage points [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1260.06s)]
*  more for people who make more than [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1262.1799999999998s)]
*  $2.5 million. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1264.12s)]
*  So the literal richest people in [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1265.1799999999998s)]
*  the country will pay this much [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1267.26s)]
*  more, except they're not going to. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1269.1399999999999s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1271.62s)]
*  They're not actually going to do [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1272.54s)]
*  it. They're just doing this to get [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1273.58s)]
*  a good news cycle. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1274.86s)]
*  And if I were them, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1275.98s)]
*  I would want a good news cycle as [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1276.8999999999999s)]
*  I prepare to hand $4.5 trillion to [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1278.7s)]
*  the wealthiest people that have [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1280.98s)]
*  ever lived, that ever walked [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1282.86s)]
*  the face of the earth. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1284.5s)]
*  But no, all it takes is, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1286.02s)]
*  let's see, according to reports, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1287.7s)]
*  Trump met with Mike Johnson and [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1290.02s)]
*  he instructed Congressional [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1291.94s)]
*  Republicans to raise taxes on [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1293.62s)]
*  the wealthiest earners as part of [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1295.3s)]
*  his big beautiful bill. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1296.98s)]
*  Well, if there's reports, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1298.42s)]
*  then maybe he'll really do it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1299.56s)]
*  Maybe we should go easy on him. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1300.86s)]
*  Bear in mind, they're working right [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1302.58s)]
*  now to extend his massive tax cuts, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1304.26s)]
*  not only for wealthy individuals, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1306.02s)]
*  but for corporations. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1307.82s)]
*  The drastic slashing of taxes on [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1308.98s)]
*  those with the most that we've been [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1310.86s)]
*  suffering under in terms of our [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1312.78s)]
*  government's ability to fund [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1314.42s)]
*  itself for literally years at this [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1316.02s)]
*  point. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1317.86s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1318.42s)]
*  Let's put up our next graphic. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1319.34s)]
*  The effect of what Trump has done [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1321.3s)]
*  to taxes, the effect on [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1323.02s)]
*  the national debt, a thing that [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1324.3s)]
*  Republicans occasionally claim to [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1326.1s)]
*  care about generally when [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1328.02s)]
*  Democrats are in charge. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1329.42s)]
*  Right now, we are looking at [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1330.94s)]
*  something like $5 to $12 trillion [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1333.02s)]
*  added to the national debt so [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1335.8200000000002s)]
*  that Trump can pay off those who [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1337.96s)]
*  bought him in the last election. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1340.2s)]
*  That is the story on taxes, okay? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1342.9s)]
*  Now I know there's people who are [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1345.5800000000002s)]
*  reporting on his supposedly wanting [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1346.94s)]
*  to raise taxes on the wealthy, and [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1348.46s)]
*  they have much bigger studios than [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1349.8200000000002s)]
*  us. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1351.22s)]
*  They have much bigger staffs than [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1351.72s)]
*  us. They probably wear nicer suits [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1352.8200000000002s)]
*  than us. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1353.98s)]
*  But this is the story that he is [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1354.5s)]
*  taking your money, he's taking that [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1356.5s)]
*  money, trillions of it, and [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1358.8600000000001s)]
*  handing it to millionaires and [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1360.7s)]
*  billionaires. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1362.5800000000002s)]
*  He is lying to you, he is conning [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1363.46s)]
*  you as he always does with this [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1365.42s)]
*  fig leaf of populism. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1367.22s)]
*  That even if it were going to go [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1369.18s)]
*  into effect, would be a drop in [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1370.82s)]
*  the bucket of the money that he has [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1372.46s)]
*  showered the wealthy with, but [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1374.22s)]
*  you're not going to get that drop. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1375.9s)]
*  And it bothers me so [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1377.6200000000001s)]
*  much that responsible journalists [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1378.42s)]
*  like we saw in that video are [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1379.94s)]
*  pretending that this is something [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1381.22s)]
*  real. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1382.78s)]
*  I mean, it is clickbait, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1383.32s)]
*  it is a big headline, but [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1384.46s)]
*  it is straight up propaganda. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1385.7s)]
*  It's exactly what John is saying. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1387.42s)]
*  It is just to get the populist [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1388.94s)]
*  notion back out there because [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1390.98s)]
*  the Bernie AOC tour, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1392.98s)]
*  the clear way in which there is [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1394.26s)]
*  favoritism toward the wealthy. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1396.14s)]
*  The oligarchy message is getting [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1398.8600000000001s)]
*  out there and now there might be [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1400.7s)]
*  the economic hardship associated [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1402.3600000000001s)]
*  with the tariffs. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1404.22s)]
*  I mean, it's easy to lose the plot [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1405.22s)]
*  that he wants his crowd to [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1407.1000000000001s)]
*  remember and that is that he's [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1408.6200000000001s)]
*  a populist president working for [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1410.38s)]
*  them. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1412.42s)]
*  And so he gets this propaganda out [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1413.3s)]
*  there and as John says, and [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1415.1000000000001s)]
*  to be fair, it's clickbait, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1416.46s)]
*  it's a big headline that he would [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1417.9s)]
*  be sweating Mike Johnson and [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1419.7s)]
*  leaning on him to try to get [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1421.26s)]
*  a tax increase on the wealthiest [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1422.7800000000002s)]
*  individuals. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1424.6200000000001s)]
*  Wow, that's good copy. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1425.38s)]
*  It's also total BS. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1426.46s)]
*  So again, this is all just [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1428.18s)]
*  a piece of propaganda. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1429.7800000000002s)]
*  And sadly, they do it so well. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1431.38s)]
*  I mean, Trump is a great [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1433.46s)]
*  propagandist. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1434.5s)]
*  What he's running into now is [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1435.26s)]
*  the headwinds of reality that are [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1436.6200000000001s)]
*  getting in the way of that [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1438.14s)]
*  propaganda, but this is nothing [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1439.22s)]
*  more than that. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1440.7s)]
*  Yeah, no, the whole thing is [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1441.5400000000002s)]
*  ridiculous and it's about to get [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1443.26s)]
*  even more insulting. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1445.02s)]
*  I can sometimes be a little bit too [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1446.3799999999999s)]
*  hard on the media. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1448.3799999999999s)]
*  So you can report on him wanting to [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1449.62s)]
*  raise taxes if you occasionally [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1451.58s)]
*  sarcastically wink while doing it. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1453.4599999999998s)]
*  Or if you polish an imaginary test [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1455.58s)]
*  tube or something while you're [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1457.62s)]
*  describing his plan to raise taxes [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1459.3799999999999s)]
*  on the wealth, you can do that. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1461.34s)]
*  Okay, but don't do it with [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1463.06s)]
*  a straight face, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1464.06s)]
*  that's insulting to your audience. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1464.74s)]
*  But anyway, Donald Trump has made [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1466.54s)]
*  it even harder for people to buy [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1468.34s)]
*  that this is a thing he's actually [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1469.86s)]
*  going to do because he decided to [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1471.54s)]

*  irresponsible about stuff like this. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1642.74s)]
*  And by the way- [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1644.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you cannot take this [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1645.38s)]

*  You can't. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1646.78s)]

*  And also, if you're making 2.5 [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1651.3s)]

*  hit your actual wealth. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1660.78s)]
*  You're not paying that tax rate on [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1663.82s)]
*  your investments. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1665.34s)]
*  Rich people are not taking it all [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1666.7s)]

*  tax, it is utterly dishonest to its [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1672.94s)]

*  Yeah, by the way, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1677.66s)]
*  that's really key what John just [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1678.42s)]

*  the uber wealthy. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1684.7s)]

*  watch those numbers carefully. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1687.18s)]

*  a day before anyone knew where [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1730.86s)]
*  she'd been taken. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1732.34s)]

*  in the ruling how terrible this act [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1747.1s)]

*  This is Judge William Sessions who [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1758.9s)]
*  says, I suggested to the government [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1760.6200000000001s)]
*  that they produce any additional [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1762.3400000000001s)]
*  information which would suggest [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1763.94s)]

*  And that was three weeks ago. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1767.46s)]
*  And there has been no evidence [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1769.18s)]
*  introduced by the government other [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1770.5400000000002s)]
*  than the op-ed. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1772.02s)]
*  She wrote an op-ed as [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1772.6200000000001s)]
*  a grad student. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1773.6200000000001s)]
*  That literally is the case. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1774.74s)]
*  There is no evidence here. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1777.0600000000002s)]
*  The court finds that Ms. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1778.7s)]
*  Azturk has raised a substantial [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1779.74s)]

*  And I want to remind everyone that [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1784.3000000000002s)]
*  while it would be great for [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1785.74s)]
*  her to be released, and [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1786.8200000000002s)]
*  hopefully that'll happen today. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1787.78s)]
*  She'll be able to be returned to [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1788.9s)]
*  her home, to her school, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1790.78s)]
*  be able to resume her doctorate, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1792.34s)]
*  talk to her family. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1794.26s)]
*  She has been in detention since [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1795.46s)]
*  March 25th. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1797.54s)]
*  Six weeks, seven weeks, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1799.46s)]
*  they're not great at math [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1801.02s)]
*  necessarily or time. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1802.46s)]
*  But that is what, worse than [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1803.98s)]
*  anything that's ever happened to [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1805.54s)]
*  many of us? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1807.42s)]
*  Sure, deeply traumatic. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1808.22s)]
*  You don't just bounce back from [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1810.06s)]
*  that being held in ICE detention [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1811.86s)]
*  for a month and a half for nothing. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1813.74s)]
*  Because you wrote an op-ed, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1816.98s)]
*  because you committed a thought [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1818.58s)]
*  crime. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1820.18s)]
*  I mean, look, we throw terms around [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1821.18s)]
*  like cancel culture and censorship [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1822.74s)]
*  and everything. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1824.38s)]
*  And it doesn't really get much [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1825.22s)]
*  darker than this. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1826.38s)]
*  Thanks to Trump, it sometimes gets [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1827.22s)]
*  a little bit darker than this. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1828.5s)]
*  She could have been sent to [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1829.74s)]
*  El Salvador and [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1830.74s)]
*  that could still happen. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1831.54s)]
*  But this is about as dark a cancel [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1833.14s)]
*  culture, a crusade against free [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1835.18s)]
*  speech as one can imagine. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1837.34s)]
*  I'll remind everyone, she was [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1839.18s)]
*  snatched up off the street and [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1840.7s)]
*  her fit, no one knew where she was [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1842.22s)]
*  for a day. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1843.9s)]
*  She could be dead, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1845.18s)]
*  she could be out of the country. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1846.02s)]
*  I mean, so many people have been. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1847.54s)]
*  That is horrifying, not only for [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1848.7s)]
*  her, but for everyone that knows [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1850.3400000000001s)]
*  her. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1852.1000000000001s)]
*  And Tufts University put out [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1852.6000000000001s)]
*  a statement saying, we look [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1853.94s)]
*  forward to welcoming her back to [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1855.3000000000002s)]
*  campus to resume her doctoral [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1856.8200000000002s)]
*  studies. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1858.26s)]
*  I hope that she's able to do that. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1859.1000000000001s)]
*  I understand if she's not able to [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1860.5s)]
*  immediately integrate back into [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1861.94s)]
*  her life after what she [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1863.42s)]
*  experienced. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1864.54s)]
*  But I also want to give a statement [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1865.3000000000002s)]
*  from one of her lawyers who said, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1866.7s)]
*  when did speaking up against [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1868.0600000000002s)]
*  oppression become a crime? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1869.3400000000001s)]
*  When did speaking up against [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1870.8200000000002s)]
*  oppression become something to be [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1872.58s)]
*  imprisoned for? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1874.5s)]
*  And again, that's all that they're [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1875.5s)]
*  saying she did, is she wrote an op [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1877.82s)]
*  ed that was critical of the Israeli [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1879.86s)]
*  invasion of Gaza. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1882.06s)]
*  But this kind of thing will have [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1884.1799999999998s)]
*  a chilling effect, won't it, John? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1885.62s)]
*  I mean- It's intended to. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1887.1s)]
*  Exactly, I mean, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1888.1399999999999s)]
*  you only have to do this a few [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1889.4199999999998s)]
*  times. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1891.5s)]
*  It's the reason the cruelty is very [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1892.4199999999998s)]
*  much a part of the strategy with [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1894.26s)]
*  this administration. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1895.8999999999999s)]
*  And this is part of just one more [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1897.26s)]
*  facet in a plan and [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1899.3s)]
*  the strategy that we've seen in [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1900.3s)]
*  across the board. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1902.26s)]
*  Everything from sweeping up these [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1903.26s)]
*  Venezuelans and [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1904.98s)]

*  To many of whom may or [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1907.38s)]
*  may not have any ties, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1908.58s)]
*  we just don't know because there [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1909.78s)]
*  wasn't a new process. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1911.26s)]
*  To the sweeping up of the Russian [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1912.1000000000001s)]
*  scientist who was detained and [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1914.9s)]
*  then jailed, imprisoned, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1917.22s)]
*  because of those frog embryos that [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1919.06s)]
*  weren't declared on the declaration [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1921.14s)]
*  form. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1923.3s)]
*  She was asked to bring them in by [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1923.82s)]
*  the researcher with whom she was [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1925.5s)]
*  working. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1927.14s)]
*  So these are all flavors of a kind. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1927.74s)]
*  And this administration and [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1932.54s)]
*  this cruelty will have a chilling [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1934.1000000000001s)]
*  effect on free speech. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1935.8600000000001s)]
*  It's already happening. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1937.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and as you said, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1938.9s)]
*  obviously that is the intent. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1940.74s)]
*  And I think back to the years that [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1942.66s)]
*  we've done this program and man, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=1945.1000000000001s)]

*  This is a huge, huge deal. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2048.82s)]
*  And as you say, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2051.1000000000004s)]
*  it can be wielded against anyone. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2051.86s)]
*  They don't need to go to a forum or [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2053.5800000000004s)]
*  in any other way find evidence. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2055.5s)]

*  didn't really have any evidence [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2059.06s)]

*  If they decide that you're an enemy [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2064.5s)]
*  of the state, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2066.26s)]
*  they can disappear you. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2066.9s)]
*  I mean, this is the new world we [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2068.1800000000003s)]
*  live in. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2069.42s)]

*  the other side of the next break, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2071.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, racing towards fascism, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2073.3s)]
*  obviously we knew that that was [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2075.34s)]
*  coming. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2077.26s)]
*  But also, and I talked about this [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2077.9s)]
*  earlier with Donald Trump and [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2079.9s)]

*  that she posted an op-ed. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2086.28s)]
*  I mean, I could, I guess, try to [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2088.1s)]
*  counter what she said with [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2090.1s)]
*  an argument of my own, but [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2091.7000000000003s)]
*  that's difficult and really, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2093.2200000000003s)]
*  really scary. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2094.94s)]
*  So no, I'm going to lock her up, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2095.82s)]
*  so disappear, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2097.42s)]
*  put her in a cell somewhere. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2098.28s)]
*  For people, my God, the movement, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2100.1800000000003s)]
*  not only the free speech stuff, but [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2101.98s)]
*  the debate me, bro. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2103.82s)]
*  I'll go on a podcast and [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2104.86s)]
*  we'll debate over it. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2106.5s)]
*  You guys, you fell apart, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2108.02s)]
*  you set fire to the Constitution. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2109.94s)]
*  Your values are gone because of [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2112.46s)]
*  an op-ed, because the words were [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2114.16s)]
*  very, very scary. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2115.88s)]
*  I don't know, the adjectives, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2117.06s)]
*  the adverbs, what was it? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2118.1800000000003s)]
*  A conjugation? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2119.3s)]
*  I don't know, what scared you so [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2119.98s)]
*  much in that? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2121.42s)]
*  Again, the right could desperately [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2122.06s)]
*  use some role model that can remind [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2124.2200000000003s)]
*  them of what a man is supposed to [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2126.14s)]
*  be like, because there's none of it [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2127.94s)]
*  in the way they've treated so [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2129.78s)]
*  many of these different students. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2131.2000000000003s)]
*  In any event, we should take another [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2133.14s)]
*  break because as I alluded to, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2134.54s)]
*  more of your rights. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2135.86s)]
*  We'll detail that on the other [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2136.7400000000002s)]
*  side of this. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2137.78s)]
*  Donald Trump's a style icon. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2139.1s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2140.6600000000003s)]
*  Wellcome back, one and all, and no, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2141.46s)]
*  Donald Trump is not an artistic [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2144.26s)]
*  person. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2146.7000000000003s)]
*  He might be the least artistic [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2147.3s)]
*  person, actually. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2149.1800000000003s)]
*  I guess he appreciates Ave Maria, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2150.5s)]
*  but other than that, I don't think [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2152.54s)]
*  he's got much of an art bone in his [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2154.6200000000003s)]
*  body. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2156.7000000000003s)]
*  He made that comment when he was [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2157.2200000000003s)]
*  talking about the art of the [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2159.06s)]
*  artist, and he said, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2161.02s)]
*  I'm not going to be an artist. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2162.58s)]

*  I don't remember. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2168.54s)]
*  I feel like that's right. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2169.54s)]
*  Probably as he was killing NPR and [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2170.74s)]
*  PBS or whatever. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2172.62s)]

*  but it was directly taken [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2178.8599999999997s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2180.22s)]
*  Awesome, okay, well, again, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2181.1s)]
*  regardless of subject, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2182.62s)]
*  no, he is not. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2183.74s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2184.46s)]
*  Also, by the way, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2185.2599999999998s)]
*  Brad David sent in a Super Chat [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2185.9399999999996s)]
*  asking if we're going to discuss [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2187.2599999999998s)]
*  India-Pakistan. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2188.66s)]
*  We're not in this first hour, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2189.74s)]
*  mainly because I need to know more. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2191.54s)]
*  I need to be able to add enough to [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2194.38s)]
*  a story to feel like I've added [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2195.86s)]
*  value to make it worth your time, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2197.34s)]
*  and I'm just not enough of [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2199.02s)]
*  an expert on that topic. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2200.26s)]
*  So I'm sure that the channel, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2201.2200000000003s)]
*  the network will be covering it, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2202.46s)]
*  and I in the future will be. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2203.94s)]
*  But I just I want to know more [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2205.42s)]
*  before I dive into it. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2206.54s)]
*  Okay, with that said, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2208.26s)]
*  let's jump into this. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2209.34s)]
*  President Trump has talked about [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2211.38s)]
*  potentially spending his [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2213.14s)]
*  work to take care of the illegal [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2214.7400000000002s)]
*  immigration troughs. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2216.5s)]
*  When could we see that happen? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2218.1s)]
*  Well, the Constitution is clear, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2220.34s)]
*  and that, of course, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2221.78s)]
*  is the supreme law of the land. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2222.7799999999997s)]
*  That the privilege of the writ of [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2224.7s)]
*  habeas corpus can be suspended in [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2226.4599999999996s)]
*  a time of invasion. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2228.54s)]
*  So I would say that's an option [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2230.3799999999997s)]
*  we're actively looking at. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2231.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so there it is. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2234.1s)]
*  I mean, look, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2235.3799999999997s)]
*  they're doing it already. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2236.1s)]
*  By the way, I love that he says [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2237.74s)]
*  we're going to look into it. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2239.3399999999997s)]
*  They have not been respecting [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2240.8599999999997s)]
*  habeas corpus this entire time, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2242.2599999999998s)]
*  in the same way that they haven't [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2243.8599999999997s)]
*  been respecting the decisions of [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2245.2599999999998s)]
*  judges, the Supreme Court, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2246.8999999999996s)]
*  any of that. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2248.2599999999998s)]
*  When you take people who have been [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2249.22s)]
*  court ordered to not be able to be [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2251.22s)]
*  deported to a particular country, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2252.66s)]
*  and then you send them there, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2254.14s)]
*  you do not get to pretend that you [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2255.46s)]
*  gave them due process, thereby, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2256.98s)]
*  there's no habeas corpus. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2258.58s)]
*  But whatever, he's at least [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2260.2599999999998s)]
*  admitting that they're going to do [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2261.38s)]
*  it more broadly, that they're [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2262.82s)]
*  looking into it. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2264.1s)]
*  And he understands that, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2264.74s)]
*  as a Republican, you're supposed [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2266.38s)]
*  to pretend to care about [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2268.38s)]
*  the Constitution, and [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2269.66s)]
*  obviously they don't. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2270.86s)]
*  But he loved the fig leaf still, so [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2272.14s)]
*  he says there, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2274.14s)]
*  the Constitution is very clear, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2275.14s)]
*  in case of an invasion, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2277.18s)]
*  you can suspend habeas corpus. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2278.58s)]
*  So we'll jump into what [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2280.54s)]
*  the Constitution actually says. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2281.82s)]
*  First of all, it, as I'm sure you [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2283.5s)]
*  know, comes initially from [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2285.5s)]
*  codification in the Magna Carta. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2287.1s)]
*  And said, no man shall be arrested [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2289.54s)]
*  or imprisoned except by [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2291.38s)]
*  the lawful judgment of his peers [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2292.7s)]
*  and by the law of the land. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2294.58s)]
*  But our version of it in [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2296.06s)]
*  the Constitution says, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2297.38s)]
*  the privilege of the writ of habeas [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2298.86s)]
*  corpus shall not be suspended, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2300.7799999999997s)]
*  unless when in cases of rebellion [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2302.62s)]
*  or invasion, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2304.46s)]
*  the public safety may require it. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2305.34s)]
*  And I'm just realizing now, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2307.18s)]
*  is that why Donald Trump [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2309.1s)]
*  capitalizes random words because [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2310.66s)]
*  of the Constitution does it? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2312.5s)]
*  Does he think it makes it seem [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2313.98s)]
*  constitutional? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2315.42s)]
*  But in any event, the only word [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2316.62s)]
*  that really matters there for [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2318.18s)]
*  the purposes of Stephen Miller is, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2319.66s)]
*  it says invasion. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2321.66s)]
*  So he, like the small brained [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2323.66s)]
*  person that he is, says, well, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2325.42s)]
*  I just claim this is an invasion, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2327.42s)]
*  I can do whatever I want. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2329.38s)]
*  And that's what they're doing [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2331.14s)]
*  right now. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2332.58s)]
*  They're implying that because some [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2333.1s)]
*  people have been victims of crime, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2335.1s)]
*  and there are some people whose [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2337.06s)]
*  paperwork is not in order, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2338.9s)]
*  we've been invaded. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2340.82s)]
*  I think I could hear the gunfire [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2343.38s)]
*  and the shells landing off [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2345.06s)]
*  in the distance. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2346.62s)]
*  I don't need to tell people [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2347.86s)]
*  watching everywhere, I've been [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2349.2200000000003s)]
*  watching this in every corner [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2350.78s)]
*  of America. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2352.1800000000003s)]
*  You look out your window and [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2352.86s)]
*  there's tanks rolling down [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2353.7000000000003s)]
*  the street, right? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2354.58s)]
*  You've been invaded? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2355.14s)]
*  Do you feel invaded? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2356.26s)]
*  I know Stephen Miller is terrified [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2357.58s)]
*  of brown people every day of his [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2359.26s)]
*  life, so he probably does actually [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2360.86s)]
*  feel like we've been invaded. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2362.6600000000003s)]
*  The rest of us are just kind of [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2364.54s)]
*  living our lives. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2365.7400000000002s)]
*  But to put in perspective how [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2366.98s)]
*  ridiculous his invocation of [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2368.58s)]
*  invasion in this case is, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2370.14s)]
*  let's take a look at prior times [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2371.58s)]
*  when habeas corpus has been [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2373.2599999999998s)]
*  suspended in the United States. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2374.66s)]
*  It's happened four times since [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2376.2599999999998s)]
*  the Constitution was ratified. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2377.98s)]
*  So throughout the entire country [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2379.7799999999997s)]
*  during the Civil War, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2381.66s)]
*  that was a rough time admittedly. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2382.98s)]
*  In 11 South Carolina counties [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2385.38s)]
*  overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2387.02s)]
*  reconstruction, I don't think [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2388.9s)]
*  Stephen Miller wants to talk about [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2390.66s)]
*  that one. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2392.5s)]
*  In two provinces of the Philippines [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2393.1s)]
*  during a 1905 insurrection and [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2395.14s)]
*  in Hawaii after the bombing of [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2397.14s)]
*  Pearl Harbor. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2398.86s)]
*  So the thing about each of those [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2399.66s)]
*  four invasions is that they're all [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2401.98s)]
*  invasions, like there was [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2404.62s)]
*  a military threat. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2406.74s)]
*  And we can debate and historians [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2409.02s)]

*  how it might have been abused in [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2412.66s)]
*  those cases and [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2414.38s)]
*  certainly it has been. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2415.2599999999998s)]
*  But at least there was a war going [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2417.1s)]
*  on, them talking about people's [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2419.2599999999998s)]
*  cats and dogs being eaten does not [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2421.62s)]
*  a war make in my mind, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2423.94s)]
*  what do you think? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2425.2999999999997s)]
*  The concocted invasion thing is so [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2427.38s)]
*  absurd, it's offensive, but [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2430.26s)]
*  it's really the hook on which [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2432.66s)]
*  they're hanging all of these [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2434.82s)]
*  blatantly illegal moves that [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2436.86s)]
*  they're making. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2438.82s)]
*  So they have no choice and [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2440.38s)]
*  it reminds me of the, when he [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2441.54s)]
*  talked about the caravan and [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2442.82s)]
*  Trump won, Trump season one. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2444.1800000000003s)]
*  When he was sending the military [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2445.7400000000002s)]
*  at Christmas time to the Mexican [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2447.26s)]
*  border, remember he said because [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2448.7400000000002s)]
*  those caravan people are coming, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2450.2200000000003s)]
*  there's an invasion. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2451.7000000000003s)]
*  I think he called him the caravan, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2452.58s)]
*  wasn't it the caravan, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2453.82s)]
*  something like that. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2454.54s)]
*  And so this is the lie that is [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2455.3s)]
*  floated because otherwise you have [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2457.34s)]
*  to play by the rules and clearly [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2459.82s)]
*  they're going to play outside [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2461.98s)]
*  the line. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2463.9s)]
*  So this is again, it's the only [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2464.5400000000004s)]
*  thing that can concoct to perhaps [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2466.78s)]
*  allow them to at least pursue this [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2469.0600000000004s)]
*  until I think the courts, all of [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2471.42s)]
*  the courts push back hard on them. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2473.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and this is utterly pathetic [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2476.42s)]
*  even if you accept that they're not [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2478.26s)]
*  doing this on purpose because they [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2480.1800000000003s)]
*  utterly despise the Constitution, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2482.1000000000004s)]
*  the constitutional rights that you [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2484.46s)]
*  have, they fundamentally down to [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2486.06s)]
*  their bone marrow, hate it and [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2487.74s)]
*  want to kill it, which is definitely [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2489.2599999999998s)]
*  true of Stephen Miller and Donald [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2491.1s)]
*  Trump, many of the people around [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2492.7s)]
*  him, but let's say that you don't [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2494.2599999999998s)]
*  believe that and they actually are [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2495.9s)]
*  this petrified about the invasion. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2497.66s)]
*  I want you to just think briefly of [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2499.66s)]
*  all of the things we've gotten [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2501.74s)]
*  through as a country without [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2503.54s)]
*  needing to suspend habeas court. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2505.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, we got through world wars, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2507.42s)]
*  the Cold War, international [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2509.7s)]
*  terrorism, terror cells pop. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2511.58s)]
*  We got through all of that, but [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2513.5s)]
*  there's some Guatemalans, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2515.42s)]
*  that dude's from El Salvador. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2517.18s)]
*  Well, you don't have any rights [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2519.46s)]
*  anymore. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2520.78s)]
*  I mean, if you accept their cover [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2521.3s)]
*  story, that is deeply pathetic. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2523.42s)]
*  And so I kind of buy it, that might [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2526.06s)]
*  actually be why Stephen Miller is [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2527.9s)]
*  doing it, but on the other hand, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2529.74s)]
*  it could just be that fascists are [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2531.58s)]
*  going to fascist. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2533.5s)]
*  And I just want to say, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2534.58s)]
*  there was the debate during [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2535.74s)]
*  the election about is it fair to [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2537.18s)]
*  call them that or whatever? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2538.78s)]
*  And people can debate [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2540.3s)]
*  definitions of fascism. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2541.42s)]
*  There are different constructs for [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2542.9s)]
*  how you label it or whatever. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2544.62s)]
*  But I don't know, I don't feel like [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2545.62s)]
*  I was being hyperbolic. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2547.94s)]
*  I feel less like that every day, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2549.82s)]
*  more that they are the movement we [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2551.7400000000002s)]
*  said they were, that these people [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2553.6600000000003s)]
*  are the goons that we said they [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2555.78s)]
*  were. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2557.7000000000003s)]
*  I just, I feel vindicated. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2558.9s)]
*  It's small comfort, by the way. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2561.02s)]
*  Right, right, right, but [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2562.86s)]
*  they see the Constitution as [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2563.94s)]
*  an impediment to their agenda. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2565.38s)]
*  And so that's why they're grabbing [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2567.02s)]
*  these things that really reflect [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2569.62s)]
*  the authoritarian rise that this [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2572.14s)]
*  crew has, right? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2574.3s)]
*  They want to do this, and [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2575.86s)]
*  it's fascistic, it's authoritarian, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2577.34s)]
*  however you want to call it. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2579.54s)]
*  It's a flex, and they don't want [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2580.94s)]
*  anything to get in the way of [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2582.54s)]
*  that flex. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2583.78s)]
*  They want to get rid of these [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2584.42s)]
*  people, and if we need to grab this [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2585.86s)]
*  excuse about an invasion, well, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2587.7s)]
*  then that's the way we'll get [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2589.54s)]
*  around this thing, which is [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2591.02s)]
*  an obstacle to our agenda. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2592.54s)]
*  And that thing is the Constitution. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2594.14s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't want to do the [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2596.7s)]
*  knee-jerk thing of automatically [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2598.5s)]
*  doing a temporary slope in this or [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2600.66s)]
*  whatever. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2602.42s)]
*  What they're doing right now is by [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2602.98s)]
*  far bad enough. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2604.46s)]
*  That's why we talk about it so [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2605.2599999999998s)]
*  much on this show on the network. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2606.58s)]
*  But the idea that Stephen Miller [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2607.94s)]
*  will be satisfied to just end due [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2610.02s)]
*  process for migrants or whatever, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2612.1s)]
*  for undocumented migrants. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2614.2999999999997s)]
*  Come on, who thinks that? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2616.46s)]
*  You don't think they'll expand [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2617.74s)]
*  that to other migrants? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2618.58s)]
*  I mean, they are literally already [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2619.38s)]
*  taking permanent residents and [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2620.7799999999997s)]
*  shipping them out. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2622.06s)]
*  Why am I talking hypothetically [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2622.74s)]
*  about things that exist in [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2624.14s)]
*  the past tense? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2625.2599999999998s)]
*  Or for student protesters. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2626.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, they've said such terrible [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2628.66s)]
*  things, their signs are very, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2629.98s)]
*  very scary to me. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2631.26s)]
*  And there's so many of them. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2632.7s)]
*  What, are we going to have a trial [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2633.78s)]
*  for every one of them? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2635.06s)]
*  For people who commit a variety of [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2636.02s)]
*  different types of thought crime. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2637.5s)]
*  Just think carefully, you want to [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2639.1s)]
*  protest against police brutality or [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2641.26s)]
*  genocide or that sort of thing. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2643.54s)]
*  You think they're going to be [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2645.54s)]
*  suddenly cool with that again? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2646.7400000000002s)]
*  They're going to rediscover their [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2647.9s)]
*  love for the First Amendment? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2649.9s)]
*  When they strip away rights, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2651.98s)]
*  they get very comfortable. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2653.46s)]
*  Historically, regimes get very [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2654.98s)]
*  comfortable with you not having [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2656.46s)]
*  those rights anymore. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2658.02s)]
*  As bad as things are right now and [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2659.54s)]
*  they are and they're bad enough for [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2661.1s)]

*  It's totally obvious. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2695.78s)]
*  I fully expect to be scrutinized [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2696.98s)]

*  away with it. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2710.06s)]

*  we're going to do that scrutinizing [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2712.3s)]

*  he's trying to get money there. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2716.5s)]
*  They're giving him more money. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2717.98s)]
*  In this case, it's not even [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2719.26s)]
*  directly the US government. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2720.54s)]
*  I mean, sure, they've showered Elon [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2722.14s)]
*  Musk recently and throughout the [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2723.62s)]

*  So let's talk about this. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2734.42s)]
*  This is a reporting from [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2735.26s)]
*  the Washington Post. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2736.3s)]
*  And we've got the country of Lesotho [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2737.54s)]
*  that had been hit on Liberation Day [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2740.54s)]
*  by 50% reciprocal tariffs. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2743.34s)]
*  So some countries can withstand [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2745.74s)]
*  this for the short term, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2747.66s)]
*  the long term. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2749.1s)]
*  For smaller countries with smaller [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2749.9399999999996s)]
*  economies, it's significantly [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2751.58s)]
*  harder, and it makes them a little [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2753.02s)]
*  bit desperate, and [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2754.5s)]
*  we have that in this case. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2755.3399999999997s)]
*  And so here is an internal State [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2756.66s)]
*  Department memo obtained by [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2758.3399999999997s)]
*  the Washington Post says, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2759.8999999999996s)]
*  as the government of Lesotho [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2761.46s)]
*  negotiates a trade deal with [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2762.98s)]
*  the United States, it hopes that [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2764.54s)]
*  licensing Starlink demonstrates [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2766.5s)]

*  If you just wanted a sign that [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2772.54s)]
*  they're going to purchase more [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2774.02s)]
*  stuff from America, then it could [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2775.62s)]
*  be whatever, right? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2777.66s)]
*  It could be phones, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2779.7s)]

*  I don't know where those things [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2782.02s)]
*  are made, probably not in America [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2783.18s)]
*  actually, we don't produce a lot. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2784.38s)]
*  But it could be something, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2785.3399999999997s)]
*  only Starlink. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2787.06s)]
*  That's the only thing we'll do. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2788.38s)]
*  This country needs to send money to [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2790.3399999999997s)]
*  Elon Musk as a proof that they're [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2792.8199999999997s)]
*  willing to play ball. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2795.22s)]
*  I mean, this is direct mob [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2796.8599999999997s)]
*  behavior, but the mob boss that's [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2798.62s)]
*  benefiting in this case is Elon [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2800.94s)]
*  Musk, okay? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2803.1s)]
*  And we see it, yeah, no, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2804.2999999999997s)]
*  it's transparent, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2805.66s)]
*  transparently corrupt. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2806.98s)]
*  And so they actually did, by the [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2808.74s)]
*  way, do this in the end. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2810.9s)]
*  Lesotho gave Starlink a Internet [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2812.7s)]
*  service license that will last 10 [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2814.86s)]
*  years, and they're not the only one [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2817.02s)]
*  by the way that's doing that. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2819.22s)]
*  The company reached distribution [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2821.06s)]
*  deals with two providers in India [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2822.86s)]
*  in March and has won at least [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2824.74s)]
*  partial combinations with Somalia, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2826.3s)]
*  the Democratic Republic of Congo, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2828.5s)]
*  Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2830.66s)]
*  Although this is probably not [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2833.2599999999998s)]
*  weirdly, he's not being that [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2835.42s)]
*  transparent about all of this. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2836.9s)]
*  And so there is just money coming [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2838.7000000000003s)]
*  in so many different forms and [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2840.7400000000002s)]
*  flooding Elon Musk's coffers, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2842.58s)]
*  not only money but also deregulation. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2844.58s)]
*  They killed those research projects [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2847.86s)]
*  into atmospheric pollution that [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2849.78s)]
*  theoretically could have produced [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2851.46s)]

*  like Jeff Bezos. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2856.58s)]
*  So the regulations are being [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2857.42s)]
*  manipulated, the law is being [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2858.98s)]

*  Before you even get to this [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=2895.46s)]

*  America and Africa. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3006.14s)]
*  And obviously, the goal is not to [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3007.34s)]

*  not because these countries [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3014.74s)]
*  genuinely want it, but because of [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3016.3399999999997s)]
*  economic pressure being provided [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3018.3399999999997s)]

*  By the way, and you rightly pointed [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3023.54s)]

*  the argument is. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3036.2599999999998s)]
*  I know that his knee-jerk thing is [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3036.94s)]

*  I don't think white people in [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3040.6200000000003s)]
*  Appalachia getting rural broadband [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3042.54s)]

*  So here's the thing, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3047.7000000000003s)]
*  maybe this is crazy, maybe [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3048.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm radical or whatever. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3050.06s)]

*  But I love that plan that John's [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3152.62s)]
*  just come up with, I mean. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3154.18s)]
*  I think we should look into it and [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3155.7799999999997s)]
*  I know that the normal way that you [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3157.3399999999997s)]
*  do that, if a Democratic president [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3158.9799999999996s)]
*  came in is that you'd have hearings [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3160.66s)]
*  and you'd have this big process and [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3162.58s)]
*  judges would weigh in. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3164.5s)]
*  But the issue is that I actually [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3165.8599999999997s)]
*  saw a dude from Colombia, so [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3167.66s)]
*  I feel like we've been invaded. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3169.2599999999998s)]
*  So I don't think the due process is [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3171.06s)]
*  really a thing anymore, so [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3172.66s)]
*  I think we might have to expedite [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3174.06s)]
*  the nationalizing of Starlink. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3175.8199999999997s)]
*  Anyway, see how this is not how [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3177.54s)]
*  you're supposed to run a government? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3178.8599999999997s)]
*  Unruly, corrupt, illegal, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3181.18s)]
*  unconstitutional acts every single [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3182.58s)]
*  day. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3184.3799999999997s)]
*  You're driving me crazy, but [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3184.92s)]
*  the sickness isn't fundamentally [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3186.28s)]
*  in me, it's in our country, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3187.88s)]
*  it's in our society. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3189.2000000000003s)]
*  Any final thoughts to close out [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3190.88s)]
*  the hour? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3192.1600000000003s)]
*  I love the passion, John, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3192.6800000000003s)]
*  I love it, it's great seeing you, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3193.6800000000003s)]
*  I agree. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3195.36s)]
*  I think this is a five alarm fire, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3196.2000000000003s)]
*  you can only handle so [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3198.4s)]
*  many things, it is a bit [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3199.7200000000003s)]
*  overwhelming. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3201.12s)]
*  But it's good that we take it [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3202.44s)]
*  fire by fire. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3204.0s)]
*  I mean, there is a quality of it all [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3205.32s)]
*  being overwhelming, but I do think [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3207.6800000000003s)]
*  that you can chip away at it. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3210.08s)]
*  And I think the more our voices [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3212.32s)]
*  are heard, I do think it matters. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3214.16s)]
*  I even think it matters to Trump [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3215.7999999999997s)]
*  when, as you suggested, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3217.56s)]
*  his polling numbers begin to sag. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3219.0s)]
*  At some point, he begins to rethink [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3221.0s)]
*  as he's doing with the tariffs, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3222.8799999999997s)]
*  policies and strategies moving [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3224.44s)]
*  forward. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3225.92s)]
*  Hopefully, yeah, again, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3226.44s)]
*  I don't know if he's watching, but [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3227.72s)]
*  some Congress people apparently [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3229.44s)]
*  are. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3231.08s)]
*  But anyway, what if people wanted [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3231.58s)]
*  to hear you breaking it down fire [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3233.8399999999997s)]
*  by fire, where would they be able [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3235.8799999999997s)]
*  to do that? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3237.92s)]
*  Thank you, I have a show, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3238.56s)]
*  the Mark Thompson show, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3239.96s)]
*  it's on YouTube, it's live, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3241.3999999999996s)]
*  two to four every day. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3243.3199999999997s)]
*  And what is that, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3244.92s)]
*  11 to 1 on the West Coast, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3245.84s)]
*  two to four on the East Coast. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3247.24s)]
*  And we're on Spotify, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3248.96s)]
*  we're on Apple, if you just want to [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3250.08s)]
*  hear the show and not watch it. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3251.7999999999997s)]
*  But the YouTube is kind of a great [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3253.4s)]
*  way to interact with the show and [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3255.08s)]
*  a great way, that's just a dynamic [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3256.7599999999998s)]
*  that we have here at TYT. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3258.6s)]
*  This is really, I grew up on TYT, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3260.16s)]
*  and so I've kind of brought a little [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3261.7999999999997s)]
*  piece of that over to [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3263.56s)]
*  the Mark Thompson show, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3264.6s)]
*  it's on YouTube. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3265.7999999999997s)]
*  Please subscribe, check it out, and [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3266.56s)]
*  hope to see you there. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3267.84s)]
*  Thanks, Johnny. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3268.68s)]
*  Thank you so much, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3269.24s)]

*  Everybody, there is more to come [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3271.92s)]
*  in this next hour. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3273.44s)]
*  Sharon Reed, Wazni Lambray, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3274.72s)]
*  should be a lot of fun, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3276.12s)]
*  don't go anywhere. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4zfNrNHzA&t=3277.16s)]
