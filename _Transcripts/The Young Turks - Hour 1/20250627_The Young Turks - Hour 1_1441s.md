The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# MTG Gets Confronted For Racist Post About Zohran Mamdani
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw)
*  In terms of Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lord Jesus, two words, seek help, tricks are for kids, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=0.0s)]
*  congressman. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=6.36s)]
*  Yesterday morning, which is of course the morning after Zoran Mamdani's win in New York. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=7.36s)]
*  You did tweet a photo or an image of the Statue of Liberty in a burka. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=12.44s)]
*  And you added the caption or comment, this hits hard. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=18.84s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=22.76s)]
*  So thankful every day that AI exists. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=23.84s)]
*  But right there you saw Marjorie Taylor Greene being asked live to respond to this incendiary [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=26.04s)]
*  meme that she posted in the aftermath of Zoran Mamdani winning the New York Democratic mayoral [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=32.04s)]
*  race. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=36.24s)]
*  And we're gonna show the video of her responding. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Cenk, any predictions of how she's gonna handle this? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=39.32s)]
*  Very poorly. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=42.32s)]
*  I'm gonna go off on these politicians in a minute. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=45.32s)]
*  I think first of all, you should be nice to her. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  But anyway, let's see what she had to say. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=50.0s)]
*  I'm an American woman and I have all the freedoms in the world to never have to bow to a religion [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=52.4s)]
*  that would force me to cover my body up and only see my eyes and my fingertips. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=60.44s)]
*  And that is a major threat for all American women. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=66.08s)]
*  And I think that's something that hits hard for all women. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  What were you tweeting that in reference to when you say it's a threat to American women? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's a Muslim takeover or possibly Sharia law. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=81.0s)]
*  That is a great threat to every single American woman. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  Of course, voters have the right to elect that and I'll maintain my right to say that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  I think Sharia law and women being forced to wear burkas is the greatest threat to our [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=92.28s)]
*  freedoms as American women. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=97.48s)]
*  Right, but are you opposed to Muslims holding elected office? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  I am 100% opposed to Sharia law in America. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  100% unapologetically opposed to Sharia law in America. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=106.16s)]
*  I'll just be thinking about that the next time she asks me to be nice to her. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=110.08s)]
*  So he is Muslim and so she's not gonna say it, but he cannot hold elected office and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  she's hardly alone in believing that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=120.84s)]
*  And this is just another example of the nonstop 24 seven identity politics from the right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=122.88s)]
*  They're not gonna even attempt to argue against Mamdani on the policies. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=128.16s)]
*  His identity is the argument. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=132.4s)]
*  He is that way. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=135.06s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=136.12s)]
*  I don't have to explain myself. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=137.12s)]
*  And in America, we don't have Sharia law. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=139.56s)]
*  Muslim like dictates or whatever do not determine the rights that you have. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=143.12s)]
*  This is America. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=146.86s)]
*  Evangelical Christianity dictates what rights you have in America, unfortunately. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=148.88s)]
*  By the way, it was earlier today that the Supreme Court came out with multiple rulings [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=152.72s)]
*  that effectively just enshrined Christian nationalist policies into law. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=157.08s)]
*  On the topic of parents rights, you had three dissenting justices saying that insurance [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=162.16s)]
*  shouldn't have to pay for HIV medication, an explicit stop to the religious right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  But anyway, so she's not gonna apologize for it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=173.76s)]
*  She's not gonna explain it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  She probably doesn't even understand the point that she's making. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  But that's her and that is just a tweet after all. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=179.88s)]
*  That's as far as it goes for her. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=182.64s)]
*  For others like Representative Andy Ogles, it's not just a tweet. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=184.82s)]
*  So he put out a tweet, but he wants action. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=189.26s)]
*  He said, Zoran Little Muhammad Mamdani is an anti-Semitic socialist communist who will [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=191.12s)]
*  destroy the great city of New York. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  He needs to be deported, which is why I'm calling for him to be subject to denaturalization [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=199.36s)]
*  proceedings. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=204.16s)]
*  So yesterday, it was like the young Republicans Club saying, we can't hope to beat this guy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=205.32s)]
*  So please save us, get him out of this country instantly. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=210.56s)]
*  And as I tweeted, the debate nebros have become the deport him bros. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  That's how much faith they have in their rhetoric and policies. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=218.5s)]
*  But anyway, that's a representative. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=221.78s)]
*  I don't know, maybe you know Cenk, what the little Muhammad means. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=223.33999999999997s)]
*  I don't even know what that's a reference to. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=227.82s)]
*  I think it's just racism. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  But he's an anti-Semitic socialist and a communist. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=230.98s)]
*  And for one or multiple of those reasons, the fact that he's a citizen is irrelevant. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=234.42s)]
*  He should be shipped out of the country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=239.38s)]
*  Now, if you're for instance like Nick Fuentes or Kanye West and you're wildly anti-Semitic, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=241.14s)]
*  you get to have dinner with the president. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=247.0s)]
*  If you are Muslim and we want to make that equate to anti-Semitism, then you don't get [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=249.04s)]
*  to hold an elected office in America. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=253.78s)]
*  Again, all this is just based off of your identity, combined with your skin color. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=255.36s)]
*  But that's two representatives losing their minds, triggered beyond rational thought over [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=260.0s)]
*  the fact that this young charismatic man did better than expected in that race. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=265.98s)]
*  And so I don't know by Monday, what is Holman gonna be doing? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=271.34s)]
*  What is Stephen Miller gonna be doing? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=275.72s)]
*  Pam Bondi is a total tool in this fascist regime. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  Is it impossible that she'll look into finding some sort of excuse? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you think that they're not pouring through his paperwork? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  He's been a citizen for years. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=286.8s)]
*  But is it possible that maybe something was punctuated wrong in one of his pieces of paperwork [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=288.86s)]
*  a decade ago? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=293.42s)]
*  Maybe he was late on something, that they wouldn't find some excuse to deport this guy [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=294.42s)]
*  based entirely off of his identity. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so I've been telling you guys, don't just blanket call all Trump voters fascists [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=300.52s)]
*  or racists, right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=306.88s)]
*  So that's about the voters, not the politicians. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  And as I've clarified a thousand times, you fight the politicians, you fight the powerful, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  you fight the donors, you fight the mainstream media, you look up, right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=316.24s)]
*  And secondly, when they're actually literally being racists or bigots, yeah, you get to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  say that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=326.4s)]
*  So here's a contrast, super random, just super chat just came in, not having to do [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=327.4s)]
*  with this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  But I'm gonna read it to you because of the point I'm making. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=333.79999999999995s)]
*  Jason Travis said, I'm a populist conservative, so agree with you on a lot of economic issues, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=336.4s)]
*  Medicaid for all, for example. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  I can say I would rather vote AOC for president than a corporate Republican, and that's why [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=344.52s)]
*  I'm a TYT member. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=350.17999999999995s)]
*  So that's awesome, and we appreciate you, Jason. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  So that's why I say, don't make blanket assumptions about the voters, they're a giant range. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=354.28s)]
*  But when it comes to the politicians, Andy Ogles is a dirtbag, and he's obviously a racist [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  bigot, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=365.79999999999995s)]
*  And I don't really care if he gets offended at all, because he obviously doesn't care [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=367.52s)]
*  if he offends Muslims, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  What is little Mohammed? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=373.32s)]
*  It's not a reference to anything, so, he's Muslim, let's all hate him. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=374.32s)]
*  That's because Andy Ogles is a moron of epic proportions, okay? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=379.84s)]
*  And what the hell is that Marjorie Taylor Green Berka thing? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=383.36s)]
*  And her explanation makes it even worse. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=386.6s)]
*  A Sharia law is the greatest threat to our freedom, really? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=389.24s)]
*  This is what I remember when Oklahoma passed a law saying that there shall be no Sharia [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=392.36s)]
*  law in Oklahoma. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=397.36s)]
*  Really, why? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=398.76s)]
*  Was Tulsa in danger of being taken over by the caliphate? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=399.76s)]
*  Okay, no, this is just a drama of hatred towards Muslims. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=403.32s)]
*  Nobody's taking over New York with Sharia law. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=406.6s)]
*  There's giant Muslim countries like Turkey that don't have Sharia law. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=408.92s)]
*  You think one guy is gonna come into New York like, that is it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=412.64s)]
*  Even though I didn't say anything about it, and I'm not fundamentalist, and I'm not radical, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=416.28s)]
*  and I'm not any of these things. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=421.44s)]
*  I'm gonna turn New York into Sharia law. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, the state legislature is gonna go along with it, and so is the city council. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=425.64s)]
*  They're not even trying to make sense, okay? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=429.68s)]
*  So what they're saying is, so if you don't like that, don't say stupid crap like that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=432.52s)]
*  Because you sound like a total utter moron. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=439.12s)]
*  It's not just that, okay, look, I can get mad about the racism and bigotry, etc. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  As a person who grew up Muslim in America, I'm a little used to it, right? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=448.64s)]
*  And that's why, honestly, I get amused by Israeli supporters who are like, I'm offended. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=454.12s)]
*  You said that word slightly wrong. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=459.0s)]
*  My God, I'm so offended, right? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  Try being Muslim for a second and see how that turns out for you. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=463.0s)]
*  But put that aside, I just wanna focus on how stupid they are. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=466.44s)]
*  Because they think all 2 billion Muslims are the same, and that we're all violent terrorists. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=470.0s)]
*  And that if Mamdani takes over New York, as takes over New York as mayor, a lot of them, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=476.24s)]
*  as we're gonna get to here, think that it's gonna be 9-11 right away. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=483.24s)]
*  Like Laura Loomer said it, others have said it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=487.72s)]
*  He's gonna come in and go, okay, that's it, I'm now the mayor. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=490.68s)]
*  This is the button to blow up New York, right? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=493.2s)]
*  There is no button to blow up New York. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=496.48s)]
*  And he's coming to serve New York. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=498.32s)]
*  But because he's Muslim, they say all these terrible things without any backup, any backup [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=500.52s)]
*  to it at all. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=504.88s)]
*  Cuz they're terrible human beings. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=505.88s)]
*  But hold, I'm gonna argue that it gets worse, okay? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=508.04s)]
*  Cuz I think what Kirsten Gillibrand is doing is not as clearly racist as this. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=512.52s)]
*  But I think that it is more subversive, more disgusting, and more likely to be effective. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=518.08s)]
*  In fact, we're asking the hardest question we've ever asked at tyt.com. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=523.52s)]
*  Who will do the most damage to Zoran Mamdani? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  A, MAGA, MAGA guys who are like, yeah, he's Muslim, he's gonna blow up New York, okay? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=530.72s)]
*  Yeah, that was a little bit of their voters. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  Hey, listen, if you don't think that in your MAGA, you're innocent. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=539.52s)]
*  If you do think that, you are a moron. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=544.04s)]
*  Okay, B, establishment Democrats, that's the Gillibrand part we're gonna get to. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=546.12s)]
*  D, donors like APAC, Bill Ackman, you can see how this is hard cuz they're all gonna [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=550.28s)]
*  come from. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=555.16s)]
*  And D, mainstream media, I don't know how to answer that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=556.16s)]
*  I think MAGA, because they're like the MAGA politicians, because they're so stupid and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=559.72s)]
*  obviously racist, will do the least damage. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=565.48s)]
*  But the other three are gonna combine for massive damage against Mamdani. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=568.72s)]
*  So John's gonna tell you about the others in a second, but what do you think so far, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  Nia? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=577.68s)]
*  I'm not acknowledging you made that impossible. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=578.68s)]
*  I'm saying B all the way, it will definitely be the Neolibs. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember when India Walton in Buffalo, New York won the Democratic primary. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  And the neoliberals found a way to snatch that from her by having the mayor that then [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=591.88s)]
*  incumbent, he was able to run on another line and captured the general election. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=597.92s)]
*  So we know Cuomo's out there now, basically saying he doesn't know what he's gonna do, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=604.6400000000001s)]
*  but he's gonna keep that line. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=608.84s)]
*  In terms of Marjorie Telegrane, Lord Jesus, two words, seek help. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  Really, Sharia law is the biggest threat to women in America, but not the legislation [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=615.36s)]
*  that has been enacted all over this country in various states that takes away a woman's [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=621.2s)]
*  ability to control her own body. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=627.08s)]
*  That's not the biggest threat. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=629.24s)]
*  What Sharia law is, how about the fact that most women are not making dollar to dollar, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=630.62s)]
*  dollar for dollar as their male counterparts? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=635.98s)]
*  That's not a big threat, but non-existent Sharia law in America is. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=639.1s)]
*  Or how about the federal minimum wage not increasing or the sub-minimum wage that we [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=644.82s)]
*  gotta do? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=649.1s)]
*  No, none of those things. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=650.1s)]
*  How about the fact that we don't have universal healthcare? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=651.4200000000001s)]
*  See those things are real threats to women in America. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=653.98s)]
*  So if the Congresswoman was really serious about fighting those threats, she would come [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=658.52s)]
*  on and join the folks on the side that wanna change material conditions. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=663.52s)]
*  And in terms of women being able to control what they wear, I can remember even in some [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=668.46s)]
*  of my church experiences being limited growing up on what I could wear. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=672.66s)]
*  In certain segments of churches, women wearing pants is not acceptable. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=678.9s)]
*  And since I was a child being indoctrinated in this way, I didn't have many choices until [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=683.5799999999999s)]
*  I became grown. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=688.56s)]
*  So for her to sit up here and say that only in some Muslim portions of Sharia, Shiite, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=690.04s)]
*  the different segments of it is the only thing that oppresses women. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=698.02s)]
*  The woman is lying, her teeth, she's lying through her teeth. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=702.16s)]
*  And I would have more respect for her if she just come on out and say that Moondani is [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=705.9399999999999s)]
*  a Muslim and that is why she is opposed to him versus playing these games, tricks, off [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=710.32s)]
*  her kids, Congresswoman. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=716.48s)]
*  Yeah, one quick thing, if you think that all Muslims are violent fundamentalists, it's [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=718.1600000000001s)]
*  like somebody coming in going, Christians, they're so stupid. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=723.2800000000001s)]
*  They handle the snakes and speak in tongues like morons. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=726.72s)]
*  No, no, that's just Pentecostal fundamentalists, okay? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  To say that all Christians like that would be mental, right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=734.9200000000001s)]
*  But Muslim terrorists are even smaller than fundamentalist Pentecostals. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=738.88s)]
*  Because they're terrorists, there's only a couple of hundred of them in the whole planet. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=745.48s)]
*  There's 2 billion Muslims, right? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  It's a microscopic percentage, right? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=751.16s)]
*  But no, when it's a Muslim, you can smear all of them. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=755.28s)]
*  You can smear a quarter of the planet and it's totally fine. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=758.04s)]
*  It's not fine if you do it to Christians, it's not fine, or Jews, or Muslims. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=761.16s)]
*  For a party that decries identity politics, they sure play a lot of it, don't they? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=765.12s)]
*  Exactly, that's a great point, Nina. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=769.28s)]
*  Because this is how, look, I say a lot of times don't fall into the trap of going along [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=771.5600000000001s)]
*  with things that are unpopular in identity politics. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=775.52s)]
*  But this is the Republicans starting identity politics and they start all the time. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=778.88s)]
*  There's another identity politics thing they started, it's called the Southern Strategy. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=783.16s)]
*  Okay, you should check that out of my book, Justice is Coming. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=787.04s)]
*  So Republicans that complain about identity politics, so when your own politicians do [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=790.64s)]
*  it, why don't you tell them to shut their mouth? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=795.8s)]
*  All right, go ahead. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=797.8s)]
*  Yeah, and in particular when the Democrats know that the Republicans elected media otherwise [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=799.24s)]
*  are doing all of this. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=804.8s)]
*  The fact that so many of them would either participate as we're gonna show you, or for [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=806.04s)]
*  the most part, a lot of them just stand back. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=810.6s)]
*  Don't defend him, don't rally around your popular future star potentially. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=813.0s)]
*  Instead, just allow them to be attacked or in some cases actually participate in it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=818.72s)]
*  And so here is Kirsten Gillibrand. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=823.0s)]
*  But I do also wanna be clear that he said he does not support violent interfaith, is [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=825.5600000000001s)]
*  that fair? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=831.44s)]
*  So Brian, I didn't hear your exchange with him. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=832.44s)]
*  But if I was speaking to him directly, I would simply say that is not how the words are received. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=837.86s)]
*  And it doesn't matter what meaning you have in your brain. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=844.48s)]
*  It is not how the word is received. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=847.2s)]
*  And when you use a word like intifada to many Jewish Americans and Jewish New Yorkers, that [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=849.76s)]
*  means you are permissive for violence against Jews. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=855.84s)]
*  So I appreciate that he told you he didn't mean that, and that's great. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=859.84s)]
*  That's a great place to start. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=863.5600000000001s)]
*  Also, he was clarifying that he never said globalize the intifada. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=865.44s)]
*  He was asked in an interview if he would denounce the phrase globalize the intifada. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=870.86s)]
*  And then that led to this kind of conversation that you were just referring to. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=877.22s)]
*  But that he was never out there saying globalize the intifada. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=883.7s)]
*  He was asked about other people who used it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=887.42s)]
*  So just to be precise about what happened there, yes? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=889.86s)]
*  Well as a leader of a city as diverse as New York City with 8 million people, as the largest [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=895.9s)]
*  Jewish population in the country, he should denounce it. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=901.18s)]
*  And that's it, period. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=906.78s)]
*  Pretty naturally it goes from denouncing him because you think mistakenly that he said [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=909.4599999999999s)]
*  it then you're reminded that he did not in fact say it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=913.66s)]
*  And you're still just denouncing him exactly as much like it doesn't matter. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=916.6999999999999s)]
*  And again, yeah, you're a leader of that state and the Democratic elector of that state also [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=919.22s)]
*  just chose him. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=924.18s)]
*  So you could potentially be a leader too, maybe speak with him. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=925.18s)]
*  Maybe especially when you see the rabid, vile Islamophobia racing towards him. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=928.26s)]
*  As we're not just talking about catchphrases, elected representatives are calling for him [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=934.6999999999999s)]
*  to be denaturalized and deported. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=939.5799999999999s)]
*  Maybe end up in CICOT or something like that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=941.6999999999999s)]
*  The fact that Gillibrand would so readily jump on board with that is depressing. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=944.62s)]
*  Now coming out of the interview, spokesman for Gillibrand said that she had misspoken [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=950.06s)]
*  when initially implying that he had said it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=954.8399999999999s)]
*  Again, she didn't misspeak, she was wrong. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=957.52s)]
*  And even when corrected held basically the same position. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=961.3199999999999s)]
*  But in any event, we've been debating who it is is gonna do more damage. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=965.0s)]
*  Cenk, what do you make of that and the willingness to do this character assassination? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=969.28s)]
*  So that's just a sophisticated way of saying, hey little Mohammed, my donors say you shouldn't [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=973.68s)]
*  be in this race. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=979.3599999999999s)]
*  Hey donors, send me money. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=980.3599999999999s)]
*  I love Israel. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=981.88s)]
*  And I'm gonna smear any Muslim that comes across here. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=982.96s)]
*  So Gillibrand's disgusting, okay? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=986.2s)]
*  So look, I'm gonna go off more on Gillibrand and tell you how dangerous she is and how [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=988.8s)]
*  counterproductive she's been to the entire Democratic Party. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=993.64s)]
*  But first, he didn't even say a word, but they're doing a character assassination based [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=996.88s)]
*  on him defending someone else saying a word. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1003.92s)]
*  Gee, I wonder if I predicted that there would be character assassinations from the left [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1008.0s)]
*  and the right. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1012.4000000000001s)]
*  Let's just watch from yesterday's show. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1013.4000000000001s)]
*  What I want you to know and look for going forward from this day to the day of the general [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1017.08s)]
*  election in New York is watch what the mainstream media does. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1023.0s)]
*  Because they're the actual hatchet men. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1026.68s)]
*  Remember the Ackman money goes into buying ads in mainstream media. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1029.64s)]
*  And then mainstream media coincidentally supports their candidate 100%. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1035.44s)]
*  And then digs and digs and digs and tries to find something wrong with Mamdani and [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1041.32s)]
*  then comes out and goes, we have this and this and this. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1045.36s)]
*  And a Republican congressman today already added, he found a rap lyric is something Mamdani [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1050.12s)]
*  sang once and he's like, he's supporting the wrong people in a rap line or whatever. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1055.28s)]
*  So you're gonna see 200 stories like that. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1061.84s)]
*  And here we go, we're on the board already. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1066.08s)]
*  Okay, it was several of them. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1067.6s)]
*  And the way that it works is it's an incestuous cycle. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1069.26s)]
*  Someone plants a story in the media. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1072.3799999999999s)]
*  Did you know he didn't denounce the phrase globalize the Intifada? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1073.86s)]
*  And then establishment Democrat like Gillibrand picks it up and goes, my God, he's saying [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1078.22s)]
*  illegal words. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1083.22s)]
*  My donors are super upset. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1084.22s)]
*  I mean, the voters of New York are super upset. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1085.42s)]
*  They're super upset that anyone's criticizing our beloved Israel. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1087.9s)]
*  I mean, this goddamn Muslim, I mean, I'm worried about the words he's using. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1091.22s)]
*  He didn't use them, but words he's defending that he might use, but he doesn't use, etc. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1096.18s)]
*  I told you, I told you, they're gonna pull one hatchet after another. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1101.54s)]
*  By the way, if they're using words he didn't even use to smear him, like I said, there's [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1105.38s)]
*  gonna be 200 of these. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1110.02s)]
*  And that also means they don't have much. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1111.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1113.8600000000001s)]
*  If they're having to go to rap lyrics from when he was a kid about some randos and they're [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1114.8600000000001s)]
*  going to words he didn't even say, that means they got bupkis. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1119.54s)]
*  They have the equivalent of Marjorie Taylor Greene and the Burka and Andy Ogles and little [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1124.14s)]
*  Mohammed. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1128.5s)]
*  So, but the reason why I think Gillibrand does more damage is because of two things. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1129.5s)]
*  One, it's more nefarious. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1134.0200000000002s)]
*  So when the idiot Republican politician goes in and goes, he's not them, I don't like [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1136.14s)]
*  about them, right? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1141.0200000000002s)]
*  And you're like, hey, everybody on the planet knows what a moron, easy to dismiss, right? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1142.0200000000002s)]
*  Gillibrand comes in with, he's offending people. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1147.94s)]
*  He's the one that's actually causing harm. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1150.7s)]
*  We have to stop him. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1152.5200000000002s)]
*  He's causing harm with his Muslimness and hit the fact that he doesn't love Israel and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1153.78s)]
*  say that we should send all our money to Israel. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1157.94s)]
*  We have to stop that stupid Muslim. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1160.58s)]
*  I mean, I'm way more sophisticated. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1162.26s)]
*  My voters are offended. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1164.94s)]
*  Hey, I'm offended a lot of words from the river to the sea, right? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1166.1s)]
*  Terrible, I denounced that. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1169.46s)]
*  I said, don't do that and the chances counterproductive, it's not gonna help us. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1170.62s)]
*  And then Benjamin Netanyahu came out and said, for the whole world, that Israel is going [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1174.1s)]
*  to do from the river to the sea. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1179.7s)]
*  He literally said it and then he literally is doing it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1182.54s)]
*  And is that a problem? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1187.02s)]
*  Gillibrand has never called that out, never. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1188.58s)]
*  No, Gillibrand loves it when Israel does the genocide, cuz tons and tons of her donors [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1190.86s)]
*  are AIPAC and other Israeli lobbyists. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1197.58s)]
*  So the Republicans stab you from the front, the Democrats stab you from the back. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1201.66s)]
*  And Gillibrand's famous for that. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1208.02s)]
*  She's the one who stabbed Al Franken in the back and said, I'm so disgusted by his sexual [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1209.86s)]
*  harassment. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1216.06s)]
*  Cuz she thought that she was gonna run for president, she did for about a second. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1217.06s)]
*  And Franken was gonna run for president at the time. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1221.02s)]
*  So she wanted to eliminate one of her opponents within the Democratic Party. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1223.5s)]
*  And now she sees Zoran Mamdani and he's unacceptably not polishing the boots of Netanyahu. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1227.3s)]
*  And so she's like, donors. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1235.86s)]
*  Remember how much I tried to put a hatchet in Mamdani's back, cuz he's a stupid Muslim. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1238.66s)]
*  You're just like Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1244.98s)]
*  In fact, you're worse than her. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1246.6200000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's how I feel about it, Nina. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1248.22s)]
*  Amen, I mean, amen. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1250.74s)]
*  She is a coward of epic proportions. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1253.02s)]
*  And yes, Democrats like her are gonna do more damage than MAGA. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1256.94s)]
*  And they're gonna combine with the media and with the money class. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1261.5400000000002s)]
*  So they all go together, but she is an absolute coward. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1265.3s)]
*  So I'm just saying, man, and what you're saying, Cenk, you summed it up. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1271.06s)]
*  I'm just saying, she's a coward. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1273.5s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1275.62s)]
*  And mainstream media will love it. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1278.42s)]
*  They'll say tut, tut, tut to Andy Ogles and Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1280.7s)]
*  And then they will repeat the Gillibrand kind of smears 2,000 times. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1284.58s)]
*  Watch, you'll see it. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1288.82s)]
*  You'll see going forward, mainstream media will take that super legitimately. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1290.3s)]
*  And they'll talk endlessly about a word he didn't even say, right? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1294.94s)]
*  And yes, intifada can mean both things and [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1298.74s)]
*  oftentimes is referred to as a global fight back against [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1302.7s)]
*  the occupation through politics, diplomacy, words. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1307.5800000000002s)]
*  And some people mean it as viless and others do not mean it as viless. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1311.7800000000002s)]
*  Also, there are words like greater Israel, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1316.26s)]
*  aretes Israel, which mean and Judeo Samaria. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1319.46s)]
*  That means that West Bank and Gaza Strip are Jewish land that Israel will swallow [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1323.26s)]
*  whole if they have the maps up in their cabinet and their Knesset, etc. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1328.46s)]
*  And they plan to ethnically cleanse all the Palestinians and take that land. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1333.34s)]
*  And they're actually doing it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1337.82s)]
*  But that has never bothered Gillibrand as long as the checks clear. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1340.06s)]
*  She's totally and completely bought by the Israeli lobby. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1344.46s)]
*  And yes, I said that. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1348.78s)]
*  And let me see you call out aretes Israel. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1350.22s)]
*  Let me see what you call out the genocidal, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1352.5s)]
*  terroristic state of Israel. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1355.54s)]
*  We just did a story earlier today, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1358.18s)]
*  aretes reporting they're murdering people getting food on purpose. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1359.82s)]
*  Civilians, 17,000 dead kids, but Gillibrand doesn't care. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1364.94s)]
*  She cares about words, words. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1370.78s)]
*  A stadium full of murdered children, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1373.3400000000001s)]
*  a pack of the check, the stupid Muslims, who cares about them, right? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1375.98s)]
*  A word offended one of my donors, a word he didn't even say. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1382.22s)]
*  So that's kind of scum Kirsten Gillibrand is, who likes to destroy people. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1386.34s)]
*  And then all of mainstream media will help her try to destroy Mom Donnie and [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1392.8999999999999s)]
*  credit to Brian Lehrer for actually staying up for the truth there. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1396.62s)]
*  Thank you, brother, for doing your job and saying what was true instead of going [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1399.62s)]
*  along with this horrifically racist senator from New York, okay? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1403.3s)]
*  No, and Jewish Americans are not the only people who get to say that they are offended. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bemUqlxvvUw&t=1408.34s)]
