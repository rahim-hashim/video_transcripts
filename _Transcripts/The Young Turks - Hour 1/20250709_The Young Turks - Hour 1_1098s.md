TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Alligator Alcatraz Detainees Speak Out About HORRIFYING Conditions
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4)
*  Welcome to alligator Alcatraz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=0.0s)]
*  The entrance here is a 30 foot tall [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=3.52s)]
*  wall, none of this was here five [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=6.36s)]
*  days ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=8.88s)]
*  It's got razor wire on the top, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=9.88s)]
*  just unbelievably impressive, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=11.88s)]
*  not a fun place to be put in prison. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  You do not want to go here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=16.36s)]
*  I'm getting swarmed at my mosquitoes [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=18.8s)]
*  right now, and we saw at least 30 [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=21.0s)]
*  alligators on our way in driving. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=22.96s)]
*  It is in the middle of truly nowhere, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=25.2s)]
*  it took us an hour, four hour drive [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=27.96s)]
*  to get here today, it's crazy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=30.64s)]
*  Last week, Florida's alligator [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=36.52s)]
*  Alcatraz welcomed its first round [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=38.52s)]
*  of migrants into the haphazard [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=40.56s)]
*  facility. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  And like we all expected, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=43.6s)]
*  it is not fit for human confinement. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=45.28s)]
*  So CBS News Miami spoke with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=47.92s)]
*  detainees at the facility and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=49.8s)]
*  they claim that they are enduring [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=51.94s)]
*  inhumane conditions including a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=54.28s)]
*  lack of access to good water, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=56.66s)]
*  inadequate food and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=58.739999999999995s)]
*  the denial of religious rights. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=60.059999999999995s)]
*  So here is some of the things that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=61.86s)]
*  what the detainees are saying. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=63.9s)]
*  One detainee, a Cuban reggaeton [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=65.82s)]
*  singer, Lame Zila Figuera, who was [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=68.1s)]
*  arrested on assault charges told [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=70.66s)]
*  CBS Miami, we've been here at [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=73.14s)]
*  Alcatraz since Friday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=75.38s)]
*  There's over 400 people here, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=77.42s)]
*  there's no water to take a bath. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=79.22s)]
*  It's been four days since [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  I've taken a bath. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=82.78s)]
*  They only brought a meal once a day [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=83.78s)]
*  and it had maggots. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=86.02s)]
*  They never take off the lights for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  24 hours, the mosquitoes are as big [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=89.62s)]
*  as elephants. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=91.94s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=94.02s)]
*  Another detainee had this to say, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=95.06s)]
*  I'm on the edge of losing my mind. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=97.22s)]
*  I've gone three days without taking [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=99.78s)]
*  my medicine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=101.66s)]
*  It's impossible to sleep with this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=102.46s)]
*  white light that's on all day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=104.42s)]
*  They took the Bible I had and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=106.46s)]
*  they said in here, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=108.06s)]
*  there is no right to religion. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=109.18s)]
*  And my Bible is the only thing that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=111.3s)]
*  keeps my faith and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=113.14s)]
*  now I'm losing my faith. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=114.06s)]
*  Yeah, that'll do it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=115.46s)]
*  And a third detainee had this to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=117.14s)]
*  say, I don't know their motive for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=118.74s)]
*  doing this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  If it's a form of torture, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=121.58s)]
*  a lot of us have our residency [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  documents and we don't understand [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=124.86s)]
*  why we're here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=126.86s)]
*  Okay, so that is the scary part [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=129.82s)]
*  People who shouldn't be sent to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=130.42s)]
*  alligator Alcatraz, which was only [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=132.38s)]
*  for the worst of the worst are now [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=134.82s)]
*  being sent there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=136.98s)]
*  And attorneys for those currently [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=138.42s)]
*  being held in the detention center [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=140.38s)]
*  cannot even reach their clients, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=142.42s)]
*  it seems. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=144.42s)]
*  So Magdalena Coopries of Coopries [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=145.22s)]
*  and Associates, who's representing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=147.58s)]
*  a Honduran immigrant located at [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=150.22s)]
*  the facility, told this to Forbes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=152.5s)]
*  We were advised that they had no [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=154.86s)]
*  instructions on how to handle [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=156.82s)]
*  attorney visits. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  Chelsea and Noel of De Bruyl and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=159.78s)]
*  Noel also had sought to contact [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  her client. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=164.22s)]
*  My client was transferred to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=165.74s)]
*  the alligator Alcatraz facility [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=167.34s)]
*  after being picked up from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=169.16s)]
*  an ice hold. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=170.58s)]
*  She said in an interview, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  since his transfer, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=173.06s)]
*  I have been unable to schedule any [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=174.42s)]
*  contact with him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=176.78s)]
*  I have reached out to the Chrome [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=178.1s)]
*  detention center and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=180.1s)]
*  they advise me that they have no [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=181.34s)]
*  information on the new facility as [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  of yet. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  Florida officials have predictably [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=187.94s)]
*  denied the allegations that this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=189.82s)]
*  facility is subpar, even though [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=191.54s)]
*  they put it up in like what do you [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=193.18s)]
*  say five days, claiming that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  the reporting on the conditions in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=196.34s)]
*  the facility is completely false. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=198.22s)]
*  The facility meets all required [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=200.01999999999998s)]
*  standards and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=202.26s)]
*  is in good working order. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=203.26s)]
*  But I guess maybe all of that is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=204.78s)]
*  just subjective. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=206.46s)]
*  But I mean, how can it be up to any [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=207.7s)]
*  kind of standards when it was just [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=209.46s)]
*  built in less than a week? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=211.14s)]
*  So here's this from Ali Velshi over [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=212.94s)]
*  at MSNBC. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=214.98s)]
*  He said Florida's Attorney General [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=215.82s)]
*  James Ussmeyer said the facility [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=218.18s)]
*  will mostly consist of tents and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=220.38s)]
*  trailers with no brick and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=222.38s)]
*  mortar construction required, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=224.06s)]
*  which seems not great considering [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=226.18s)]
*  Florida's stifling summer heat and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=228.42s)]

*  So Was, I want to get your thoughts [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=298.9s)]
*  on this, we're going to be talking [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=301.1s)]
*  about the monetization and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=303.3s)]
*  the memeification of all this in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=305.02s)]
*  a little bit, but are we surprised [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=307.14s)]
*  that this thing is being run about [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=309.3s)]
*  as well as like a public toilet? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=311.5s)]
*  Well, I mean, we can't be [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=313.5s)]
*  surprised, especially as you [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=315.34s)]
*  mentioned, Yaz, how haphazardly [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=317.62s)]
*  this all came together. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=320.06s)]
*  They kind of just slapped it [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=321.54s)]
*  together as quickly as possible, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=323.1s)]
*  which is why it's like these [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=325.26s)]
*  shoddily built tents and trailers. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=326.98s)]
*  Because they ran into the problem [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  that just picking people up, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=332.26s)]
*  you got to be able to process them [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=334.54s)]
*  before you move them out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=337.1s)]
*  And they're not able to meet the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=339.42s)]
*  rate of their deportations that has [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=341.9s)]
*  been their stated goal, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=344.82s)]
*  which if the reporting is to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=346.86s)]
*  believe they're trying to at least [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=349.06s)]
*  surpass the Obama levels of I [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=351.62s)]
*  think it was something like 400,000 [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  a year or something like that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=356.66s)]
*  And they're just not getting to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=358.82s)]
*  that level yet. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=360.54s)]
*  They weren't even able to reach [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=361.42s)]
*  200,000 I think by the time June [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=363.38s)]
*  came so they were at a slower pace. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=365.46000000000004s)]
*  And they realized that they have to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=368.02000000000004s)]
*  be able to detain these folks [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=370.26s)]
*  instead of allowing them to just go [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=372.18s)]
*  through their process, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=374.58000000000004s)]
*  their court process and going out [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=376.22s)]
*  and doing the process in the way [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=378.66s)]
*  that it was meant to be carried [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  out. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=383.14s)]
*  I just think, again, we talked [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=383.7s)]
*  about this a lot on the show, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  that depravity is kind of the point. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=387.58s)]
*  They're trying to send a message to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=390.02s)]
*  all undocumented people that when [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=392.38s)]
*  they catch you, they're going to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=394.78000000000003s)]
*  put you basically in a gulag. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=397.02s)]
*  And they want people to quote unquote [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=399.34000000000003s)]
*  self deport. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=401.66s)]
*  And this is despite the fact that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  most of the people that they're [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=404.66s)]
*  picking up are doing the process [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=406.54s)]
*  legally. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=408.46s)]
*  Now, conservatives, what they [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=409.26s)]
*  would say is that Biden, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=411.06s)]
*  he didn't have the authority. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=412.46s)]
*  He did these executive orders that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=414.38s)]
*  sort of made it way less [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=416.62s)]
*  restrictive in terms of the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=418.14s)]
*  standards for people who are seeking [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=419.98s)]
*  asylum, etc, etc. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=422.42s)]
*  That being said, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=423.98s)]
*  he was the president, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=424.9s)]
*  the duly elected president at [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=426.18s)]
*  the time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=427.94s)]
*  And these folks are actually [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=428.5s)]
*  following the laws under which they [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=430.34000000000003s)]
*  came under, the pretenses, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=432.74s)]
*  the demands under which they came. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=434.54s)]
*  And conservatives would say that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=436.98s)]
*  was illegitimate and therefore we [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=438.74s)]
*  get to treat these people like [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=440.74s)]
*  pieces of garbage. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=442.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I had a Republican [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=443.70000000000005s)]
*  voter recently say to me like, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=445.26000000000005s)]
*  why can't they just come over here [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=446.78000000000003s)]
*  legally? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  A lot of the people who are going [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=449.02000000000004s)]
*  through legal avenues, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  they're being picked up at [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=451.62s)]
*  courthouses whenever they come [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=452.86s)]
*  for and they show up for [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=454.26s)]
*  their court appearances. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=455.38s)]
*  Because that is part of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=456.74s)]
*  the legal process. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=457.78000000000003s)]
*  And then they're being thrown into [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=458.86s)]
*  facilities like this one and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=460.70000000000005s)]
*  their lawyers can't even get to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=462.22s)]
*  them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=463.94s)]
*  So, we're going to get to a lot [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=464.58s)]
*  more of that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=466.22s)]
*  The depravity really was on display [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=466.98s)]
*  though, with that clip that we just [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=469.06s)]
*  saw from Benny Johnson and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=471.02s)]
*  he was giddy about how horrible it [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=472.58s)]
*  was and how high the walls were and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=474.62s)]
*  how isolated it was and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=476.66s)]
*  how there's so many mosquitoes [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=478.02s)]
*  there. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=479.9s)]
*  Mosquitoes are not just, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=480.5s)]
*  they don't just make you itchy, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=481.66s)]
*  they carry so many diseases. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=483.22s)]
*  It's really unsafe for [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=484.5s)]
*  people to be there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=485.62s)]
*  So anyway, of course, they're going [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=486.9s)]
*  to use this as a way to get some [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=489.7s)]
*  good coverage on social media and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=491.98s)]
*  make some money off of it because [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  they wouldn't be the MAGA people [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=496.74s)]
*  that we have come to know if they [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=498.86s)]

*  Alcatraz only gets worse because [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=503.54s)]

*  neoliberalism and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=729.38s)]
*  then what ties it together, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=730.3s)]
*  is this anti-immigrant sentiment, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=731.9s)]

*  of cheap old labor, right? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=773.26s)]
*  And so the movement is based on [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=775.5s)]

*  system that we have here in this [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=882.78s)]

*  is cheap labor. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=886.38s)]
*  They have to maximize the dollar, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=887.62s)]
*  they have to maximize profits. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=889.38s)]
*  That is the whole point of our [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=890.8199999999999s)]
*  entire economy. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=892.66s)]
*  So whenever the dollar is [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=894.5799999999999s)]
*  prioritized, that means that [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=895.86s)]

*  And that's why the idea of running [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=898.62s)]
*  this country as a business never [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=900.42s)]

*  Dirty commie, that's what we're [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=908.26s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=910.86s)]

*  if you run it as a business, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=912.82s)]

*  I think there's an idea that in [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=921.58s)]
*  a perfect world, there's some kind [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=923.26s)]
*  of balance that can be struck [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=925.26s)]
*  somewhere where people would get [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=926.86s)]
*  all the things that they need and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=928.66s)]

*  But at the same time, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=933.38s)]
*  we're still going to be promoting [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=934.54s)]
*  business and [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=936.38s)]
*  running an efficient economy. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=937.18s)]
*  Sure, those are good goals to have, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=939.14s)]
*  right? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=940.9s)]

*  means people are not getting paid. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=947.66s)]
*  And it means higher profits, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=949.86s)]
*  which means people are getting [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=951.1s)]

*  all these gang members. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=993.02s)]

*  And then their solution just [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1023.34s)]
*  creates much bigger problems that [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1024.94s)]
*  they pretend to just not see. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1026.82s)]
*  So I'll give you the final word [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1028.82s)]
*  before we get a break. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1030.14s)]
*  I mean, yeah, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1031.8600000000001s)]
*  that's another thing to understand. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1032.42s)]
*  I think we need to hit home [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1033.94s)]
*  substantively. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1035.3400000000001s)]
*  I think even with the insane new [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1036.42s)]
*  ICE budget, all of the craziness [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1038.46s)]
*  they're doing in MacArthur Park with [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1040.5800000000002s)]
*  freaking army dudes on horses, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1042.98s)]
*  looking ridiculous. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1044.98s)]
*  All of that is spectacle. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1046.6200000000001s)]
*  You don't do spectacle if you [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1048.26s)]
*  actually have the goods. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1050.02s)]
*  If you actually have a way of [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1052.5s)]
*  delivering this thing that you told [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1053.74s)]
*  all of these people that you were [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1055.42s)]
*  going to deliver for them, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1056.94s)]
*  which is roll back completely. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1058.26s)]
*  Not just seal off the border, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1060.26s)]
*  which you notice they don't talk [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1061.42s)]
*  about anymore. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1062.74s)]
*  Nobody's coming across the border [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1063.3000000000002s)]
*  anymore, but actually reverse it in [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1065.0600000000002s)]
*  the sense of sending all of these [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1066.98s)]
*  people quote unquote back to where [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1068.6200000000001s)]
*  they came from. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1070.42s)]
*  They're not going to do it. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1071.46s)]
*  They allocated all this money, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1073.7s)]
*  it's not going to happen. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1075.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so good luck to them, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1078.1000000000001s)]
*  I guess. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1080.14s)]
*  I don't know, this thing can't stay [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1081.14s)]
*  open, this thing cannot go on and [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1083.66s)]
*  the people who are supporting it [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1085.98s)]
*  are very much so on the wrong side [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1088.18s)]
*  of history. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1090.42s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1091.5s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1093.18s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifexB1kU4&t=1094.6200000000001s)]
