# Joni Ernst Gives GHOULISH Response To Voter Concerned Over Medicaid Cuts
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw)
*  Everyone says that Medicaid is being cut. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=0.0s)]
*  People are gonna see their benefits cut. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=2.94s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=4.78s)]
*  Now, go ahead. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=6.48s)]
*  It's corrections of overpayments and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  people that have not been eligible for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=10.78s)]
*  these programs by law as it is currently written. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=13.42s)]
*  People are not, well, we all are going to die. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  So for heaven's sakes, for heaven's sakes, folks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=21.06s)]
*  That was Republican Senator Joni Ernst being [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=25.76s)]
*  unbelievably flippant about the likely [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=29.6s)]
*  devastating impacts of Medicaid cuts. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  So at a town hall in Iowa on Thursday, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=35.88s)]
*  frustrated attendees interrupted Ernst as she [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=38.32s)]
*  repeatedly defended the big, beautiful bill and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=41.2s)]
*  what it means for recipients of Medicaid. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  From the New York Times, the sprawling [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=46.8s)]
*  legislation which contains a $4 trillion tax cut that would [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=49.2s)]
*  provide the biggest savings to the wealthy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=53.12s)]
*  Also would make several changes to Medicaid, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=56.12s)]
*  including adding a strict new work requirement. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=58.72s)]
*  The independent nonpartisan [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=61.64s)]
*  Congressional Budget Office projected that the bill would [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=63.36s)]
*  cause around 10 million Americans to become uninsured. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  And the truth is that the overwhelming majority of people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=70.28s)]
*  on Medicaid are working or have no valid reason not to be. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  Based on the data, only a small share of Medicaid [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  adults were not meeting work requirements or [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=81.36s)]
*  would not have qualified for an exemption. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=84.08s)]
*  However, many more Medicaid enrollees who would remain [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  eligible would be at risk of losing coverage because of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=90.08s)]
*  the administrative burden and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=93.28s)]
*  red tape related to reporting requirements. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=95.32s)]
*  The bill also reduces the amount of Medicaid expansion funding [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=98.24s)]
*  the federal government provides to certain states. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=102.28s)]
*  And if states have gaps in federal funding, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=105.28s)]
*  they may have to pay a fee. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=107.6s)]
*  If states have gaps in federal funding, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  they may have to make additional cuts. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  Nonetheless, Ernst dismissed her constituents concerns saying, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=113.44s)]
*  we're all going to die anyway, so what's the big deal? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=117.36s)]
*  She did go on to claim that the Republicans will protect [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=120.64s)]
*  the most vulnerable recipients of Medicaid. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=124.48s)]
*  But the attendee who said that people could die if Medicaid is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  cut is absolutely correct based on the data. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=131.08s)]
*  So this is from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=134.6s)]
*  Policy. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=138.04s)]
*  And it says new research finds that Medicaid expansions under [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=139.48s)]
*  the 2010 ACA and earlier state waivers reduced mortality among [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=143.72s)]
*  low income adults by 2.5%, representing a 21% decrease in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=148.44s)]
*  the mortality hazard for new enrollees, saying about [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=153.16s)]
*  27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=158.2s)]
*  An additional 12,800 deaths could have been prevented [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=163.92s)]
*  had all states opted to expand Medicaid. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=169.11999999999998s)]
*  So nonetheless, Ernst is remaining defiant. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=174.16s)]
*  Her spokesperson had this to say after the backlash and said, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=176.44s)]
*  while Democrats fear monger against strengthening the integrity [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  of Medicaid, Senator Ernst is focused on improving the lives of all Iowans. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=183.16s)]
*  There's only two certainties in life, death and taxes, and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=188.76s)]
*  she's working to ease the burden of both by fighting to keep more of Iowans hard [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  earned tax dollars in their own pockets and ensuring their benefits are protected [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=197.64s)]
*  from waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  My God, there's more to this story, but I want to stop and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=204.64s)]
*  get your thoughts on this because it's so disrespectful to not just the people of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=209.48s)]
*  Iowa, but just a human life, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=214.6s)]
*  We're all going to die anyway. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  Nobody wants to die before their time. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  Nobody wants to suffer as they're dying and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=221.04s)]
*  nobody wants to die when they don't have to die, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=222.92s)]
*  That is the point and the government is supposed to take care of these people. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  Otherwise, what is the point of having a federal government? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=229.0s)]
*  Jordan, what is your take on this? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  It's so ridiculous just to hear it said out loud. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=233.68s)]
*  And even when I was reading that quote from Ernst's people, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=236.6s)]
*  I almost couldn't get through it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  It's so ridiculous. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=243.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the Republicans hate you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=245.32s)]
*  I hope everybody understands that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=249.0s)]
*  They hate you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=250.88s)]
*  They do not care about you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  She gets a government funded health care plan that takes care of everything [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=253.48s)]
*  that she or her family might incur. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=258.76s)]
*  Everybody else working people? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=262.44s)]
*  No, good luck. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  Not only are potentially millions of people going to lose their health insurance [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=265.16s)]
*  as a result of these cuts, from what I understand, they do not qualify [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=270.08s)]
*  for a life event exemption to enroll in the Affordable Care Act or [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  in a plan on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  So if it happens in the middle of the year, like it's like it's poised to do, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  and these go into effect, millions of people won't just lose their Medicaid. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  They will lose insurance altogether. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  That's when people die. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's what they were trying to highlight. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=300.08s)]
*  And she could not care less. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  Oh, we're all going to die. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=304.11999999999995s)]
*  She can say that because she's fine. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=305.64s)]
*  And this callousness, this disgusting sickness that we're seeing from [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=308.44s)]
*  Republicans has to be stopped. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=312.56s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to say thankfully because it's from a cost cutting [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=314.4s)]
*  perspective, but there are a few people, Rand Paul is one of them. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=318.88s)]
*  We might see some major defections in the Senate. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=324.0s)]
*  So hopefully these don't come to fruition because these are preventable [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=327.76s)]
*  deaths that we can do something about now to save. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=337.04s)]
*  I mean, that's such a good point. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=337.32000000000005s)]
*  And I just want to emphasize that she is saying these things because she does [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=338.76000000000005s)]
*  have access to healthcare. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  And I don't know if people really understand the mindset of having access [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=343.88000000000005s)]
*  to something and then saying it's not a big deal for these people over here who [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  don't, because if you have good healthcare, it's so easy for you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=352.52000000000004s)]
*  If you get sick to just call up your doctor or go get a prescription from [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=356.48s)]
*  somewhere. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=360.6s)]
*  There are so many people in this country who can't do that or who won't do that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=361.16s)]
*  because they're afraid of incurring some kind of surprise bill that they didn't [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=364.52s)]
*  know they would have to pay. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=368.48s)]
*  There's so much uncertainty with American healthcare that so many Americans who [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=369.8s)]
*  should be able to participate in it simply do not. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=373.36s)]
*  And they live wildly different lives than the people who do have healthcare. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=376.36s)]
*  It's a mental thing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=381.16s)]
*  It's like a mental state of what you're allowed to have and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=382.12s)]
*  what you have access to. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=386.6s)]
*  It's just like how people who have so much money don't understand what it's like [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=388.4s)]
*  to live as somebody who doesn't have money. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=391.64s)]
*  So all right, Sharon, what do you have to say about this? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=393.28s)]
*  What a nasty woman. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=395.52s)]
*  She's an unbelievably nasty, nasty woman, okay? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=397.24s)]
*  And if she were an independent contractor working for Amazon or perhaps, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=402.32s)]
*  not everywhere, but a lot of Amazon independent contractors or Uber or [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=407.96s)]
*  DoorDash, perhaps she wouldn't be talking like this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=413.0s)]
*  I call her a nasty woman because she doesn't even have to come before [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=416.24s)]
*  her constituents. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  I'd rather her arrogant butt stay at the country club and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=420.96s)]
*  leave these people alone. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=423.96s)]
*  If you're not going to be genuine and you have a black heart, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=424.92s)]
*  that's what she should do. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  But instead, it was like she relished it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=430.52s)]
*  She rather enjoyed herself, it seemed like. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=433.2s)]
*  She's so ignorant and out of touch, out of touch with everyday people who, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=435.4s)]
*  let alone a mother, can't afford to get sick because she has to go out [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=442.12s)]
*  the door to work. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=446.16s)]
*  But can you imagine if you're caring for your child or your parent, and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=446.76000000000005s)]
*  they better not get sick because you will not be able to help them? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=452.36s)]
*  This woman is sick in a different way, just disgusting. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  We have to rid the government of these kind of callous people and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=461.04s)]
*  their black hearts, and that's not about politics. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  It's about greed, it's about vapidness. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=469.32000000000005s)]
*  She's disgusting. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  I find her completely disgusting. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=474.0s)]
*  It was barf time to have to listen to her. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=475.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, the Republican Party is trying to get rid of empathy because [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=478.76000000000005s)]
*  empathy is weakness, but yet they still want to govern all these people. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=482.48s)]
*  And you know what, Sharon, it's funny that you said, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=486.04s)]
*  why doesn't she just stay home? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=488.52000000000004s)]
*  Because maybe that is what's going to start happening. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  So Journey Ernst isn't the only Republican lawmaker getting an earful [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=493.20000000000005s)]
*  from fed up constituents recently. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=497.36s)]
*  Representative Mike Flood faced furious residents at his town hall the other day. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=499.76000000000005s)]
*  And when asked about proposed measures in the big beautiful bill that would make [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=505.32s)]
*  it easier for the US government to defy court orders, this was his response. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=509.4s)]
*  He said, I'm not going to hide the truth. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=513.92s)]
*  This provision was unknown to me when I voted for that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=516.48s)]
*  So his defense for voting for the bill is that he didn't read the bill. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=520.4s)]
*  So Representative Ashley Hinson in Iowa faced similar heat from her [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=524.72s)]
*  constituents earlier this week. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=529.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=530.76s)]
*  I'm proud to vote for President Trump's one big beautiful bill last week. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=531.36s)]
*  This is a generational investment. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=536.44s)]
*  This is a general investment. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=539.84s)]
*  This is your time. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=543.4s)]
*  The President is, I believe, fighting for you and fighting for me. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=545.72s)]
*  I'm fighting alongside of him. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think God saved President Trump's life in Butler. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=550.76s)]
*  I think he saved his life in Butler, Pennsylvania for a reason. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=554.64s)]
*  He is helping deport criminal illegal aliens rather than letting them roam our streets [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=558.16s)]
*  freely. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=562.72s)]
*  At a recent event in Cedar Rapids, I received overwhelmingly positive feedback about the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=563.72s)]
*  work that Doge is doing. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=568.8s)]
*  My entire philosophy is the intent behind Doge is that we absolutely have to cut waste, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=570.48s)]
*  fraud and abuse. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=578.04s)]
*  All right, so the town halls have been so contentious since Trump took office that Republican [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=579.52s)]
*  lawmakers have now been advised by the National Republican Congressional Committee Chair against [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=587.4000000000001s)]
*  holding them at all. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=592.84s)]
*  And you have to, first of all, I feel like I called this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=594.24s)]
*  I said, why are they even doing these town halls anyway? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=597.2s)]
*  They're gonna stop doing them altogether because it's such bad press for them, right? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=600.6800000000001s)]
*  They have to keep defending themselves every time they get booed constantly, incessantly. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=604.96s)]
*  And it's not just the representatives who are getting booed. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=608.96s)]
*  Trump is getting booed and you know he didn't like that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=613.24s)]
*  And Doge is getting booed and Elon Musk is getting booed. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=615.72s)]
*  All these people collectively are getting booed by these Republican constituents. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=618.84s)]
*  And whether or not they're Republican voters or not really doesn't matter because these [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=624.0400000000001s)]
*  Republicans are representing all these people. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=627.58s)]
*  And Sharon, do you think that it matters whether or not they're doing these town halls anymore? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=631.9200000000001s)]
*  Because they're not listening to the people anyway, they're gonna do whatever they wanna [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=638.48s)]
*  do anyway. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=641.76s)]
*  Lindsey Graham actually said at one point, because I don't need to go talk to the people [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=643.16s)]
*  to know how to do my job. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=647.32s)]
*  They're just gonna do whatever they wanna do. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=649.16s)]
*  That honestly, I'm surprised that they've done as many as they have done so far. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=651.52s)]
*  Yeah, they're indoctrinated cowards. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=655.32s)]
*  And I suspect the only reason they're still doing some is because they've got a pinch [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=658.04s)]
*  of worry about election time when that comes around when their seats are up. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=662.16s)]
*  But they honestly have pledged their undying support to a dictator. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=667.08s)]
*  And he, one man, and his orange tan means more to them than they're that scared. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=673.2s)]
*  Look at these cowards. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=680.6s)]
*  They can't even band together and do something they're that afraid and they let it get this [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  far? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=688.9200000000001s)]
*  Despicable, no, they don't care about the booze and they're not going to keep going [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=695.72s)]
*  They're gonna go to the beach or something, okay, or maybe they'll just play a videotape. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=696.72s)]
*  This is where the American people in every jurisdiction need to come out in full force [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=700.72s)]
*  and not leave these people alone. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=707.36s)]
*  They'll try to pass laws, show up at their congressional offices before you're kicked [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=709.52s)]
*  out, okay? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=714.48s)]
*  They'll accuse you of insurrection if you do that, but we've gotta do it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=715.48s)]
*  And how pathetic, Donald Trump, whenever somebody doesn't like him or Elon, he took his chainsaw [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=719.24s)]
*  and went home and was just so angry. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=725.64s)]
*  Empathy, they want empathy when they're being talked poorly about for really poor crap behavior. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is what we get until we take back our rights. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=736.0400000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable to me. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=743.2800000000001s)]
*  All right, what do you think, Jordan? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=745.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think, yes, show up, speak out, get organized, put pressure on them now, of course. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  We have seen that work before. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=755.2s)]
*  Remember Trump's first term. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=758.32s)]
*  He tried and tried and tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but there was so much [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=760.16s)]
*  pressure, they caused major defections in the Senate and that ultimately killed it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=765.04s)]
*  There are multiple vulnerable senators going into 2026. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=771.0s)]
*  Joni Ernst is one of them. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=775.76s)]
*  She's up for reelection. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=777.84s)]
*  You can single them out and continue to put pressure on them in hopes of changing their [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=779.68s)]
*  vote. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=784.36s)]
*  So if, of course, do that now, but also, and I was thinking about this earlier, you can't [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=785.36s)]
*  just hang up your hat if a Democrat wins in 2028. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=791.92s)]
*  You can't do it because that lack of pressure to push them in an even bolder direction results [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=796.6s)]
*  in moments like this. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=804.84s)]
*  This could be preventable. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  People showed up and stayed involved while Biden was president and continued on the progress [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=809.24s)]
*  that they had built in Trump's first term. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=816.0s)]
*  We might not be in this situation now. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=819.6s)]
*  Of course, this audience knows that, but you really need to put pressure on your friends [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=822.4s)]
*  and family who check the box, but then just sit at home for four years. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  It's also continuing to stay organized in your community to enrich and build the grassroots [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=832.16s)]
*  and continue to apply pressure, especially when a Democrat is in power. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=838.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's such an important point because I really do feel like not enough people [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=843.24s)]
*  are engaged at their local and state levels. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=848.24s)]
*  And that is where you can enact the most change that is going to impact your life more directly [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=851.24s)]
*  than whatever is going on at the federal level. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=856.56s)]
*  Not to say that what's going on federally is not important, but a lot of the groundwork [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=858.64s)]
*  is laid right here in your own city and town and state. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=862.24s)]
*  I live in Texas. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=866.24s)]
*  I know what that's like. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=867.28s)]
*  I know what it's like to have the state interfering in my local government. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=868.28s)]
*  I know what it's like to feel like certain people are overtaking your school districts [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=871.6s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=876.72s)]
*  I mean, these are things that really do impact your communities. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=877.72s)]
*  And it's kind of like what Jordan was saying about getting involved and staying active, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=880.92s)]
*  especially when Democrats are in office. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=885.84s)]
*  It's like, what's a good analogy for this? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=888.88s)]
*  When you're already happy with your health and it's easier to maintain that versus if [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=892.12s)]
*  you're trying to overcome something, right? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=897.04s)]
*  It's always better to prevent and maintain than it is to just defeat something outright [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=898.56s)]
*  and get on with it that way. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=902.7199999999999s)]
*  We do have some people who are fighting and trying to get into position to maintain some [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  kind of better status quo, hopefully. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=911.36s)]
*  But it is the job of the American people to hold our representatives accountable. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=914.1999999999999s)]
*  They shouldn't have the option to just not talk to us. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=919.7199999999999s)]
*  They shouldn't have the option to just not do town hall. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=922.4s)]
*  So it's kind of like what Sharon was saying, if I understand you correctly, Sharon, to [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=925.6s)]
*  just find them, badger them. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=929.12s)]
*  That's their job, right? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=932.8000000000001s)]
*  That's the job that they wanted. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=934.28s)]
*  That's the job that they campaigned for the right, for the privilege for them to do. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=935.9s)]
*  And we said, sure, you can do it because we think that you're gonna do a good job. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  And- Yeah, but the longer they stay, the more they [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=944.48s)]
*  believe that they are entitled to it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=947.72s)]
*  And that's really the issue. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=950.48s)]
*  Yeah, and you can't have a functioning democracy whenever there's that level of entitlement [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=953.0400000000001s)]
*  from your elected leaders. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=958.08s)]
*  It's just not gonna work, and especially when you have the, then there's also the corruption. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=960.48s)]
*  But- That, gold bars and such. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=965.76s)]
*  That's another story. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=968.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=971.2800000000001s)]
*  It is a very interesting, scary time that we're in right now. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=973.46s)]
*  And I think there's so much stuff that's always constantly happening that people are just [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=978.0s)]
*  trying to cope and figure out how to do that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Qtsue1aBw&t=982.2s)]
