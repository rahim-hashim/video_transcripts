# Trump Has EPIC Meltdown Out Of Frustration With Israel, Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw)
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=0.0s)]
*  don't know what the f they're doing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=5.68s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  I do, I do understand that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=10.16s)]
*  That was President Donald Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=12.08s)]
*  And as of this morning, it seemed as though the ceasefire deal between Iran and Israel [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=13.92s)]
*  was basically off. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=19.56s)]
*  And that was what Trump was responding to. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=21.44s)]
*  He was frustrated by it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=23.22s)]
*  But what was even more surprising was the tough talk that he had for Israel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=25.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=31.64s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=32.64s)]
*  the likes of which I've never seen before. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=37.56s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=39.88s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=41.64s)]
*  When I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=44.0s)]
*  everything you have on them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=49.92s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=51.64s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning because the one rocket that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=53.56s)]
*  didn't land that was shot, perhaps by mistake that didn't land. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=62.2s)]
*  So he's referring to Iran allegedly shooting a rocket or a missile that may have been shot [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=64.84s)]
*  accidentally. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=71.84s)]
*  It didn't hurt anyone. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=72.84s)]
*  It didn't damage anything. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=73.84s)]
*  And then in response to that, Israel basically does what Israel usually does, okay, overreact, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=75.92s)]
*  over respond and use disproportionate force. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=82.28s)]
*  Now that's the reason why he had harsher words for Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=86.56s)]
*  And to be honest with you, I don't think I've ever heard an American president be so critical [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=89.56s)]
*  of Israel openly, overtly. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=95.52s)]
*  You'll read about what they have to say about Israel behind the scenes, maybe. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=98.12s)]
*  But in this case, wow. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=102.64s)]
*  Now let me just quickly say, Cenk, before I go to you, the ceasefire is back on. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=104.44s)]
*  I still think it's a little bit fragile considering the fact that we all know that Israel wants [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=110.0s)]
*  a regime change war. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=115.0s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=116.52s)]
*  Now their statements later in the day made me think maybe this will hold. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=117.76s)]
*  I don't wanna get too hopeful because every time I get too hopeful, things fall apart. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=123.28s)]
*  But Cenk, I'm curious what you think. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=126.88s)]
*  No, I'm gonna go way further. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=128.12s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=129.52s)]
*  It's the first time I've ever seen an American president do that in my lifetime. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=130.52s)]
*  And so, okay, now the usual caveats and then I'll get back to why I loved it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=134.76s)]
*  That doesn't mean I love Trump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=140.28s)]
*  That doesn't mean I agree with everything Trump does. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=141.6s)]
*  That doesn't mean that I agreed with Trump when he dropped bombs on Iran. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=143.72s)]
*  It doesn't mean that I have a mind meld with everything Trump does just because I agree [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=147.12s)]
*  with one thing he did. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=153.28s)]
*  Okay, now back to our regular programming. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=154.48s)]
*  Okay, so did you ever see Biden going, both these countries, Israel and Iran, are effing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=156.88s)]
*  around, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=163.8s)]
*  No, he would never say that about Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=165.0s)]
*  And so him yelling at Israel, this is just unprecedented. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=167.92s)]
*  I mean, show me an American president who yelled at Israel in my lifetime. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=172.04s)]
*  NBC News reported today that the Israelis were stunned, stunned by- [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=176.48s)]
*  Yes, yes, okay. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=180.84s)]
*  And so, look guys, it's not just standard caveats. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=184.12s)]
*  It's true. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=187.64s)]
*  He started the war in the first place. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=188.64s)]
*  He shouldn't have done that, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=189.64s)]
*  He shouldn't have dropped the bombs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=190.64s)]
*  And I was furious with him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=191.64s)]
*  I mean, we were on tape. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=192.64s)]
*  You saw it when it happened. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  When he does terrible things, you massively criticize him, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=195.92s)]
*  Now when he's doing the right thing and going, okay, well, now we're gonna do a ceasefire. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=200.27999999999997s)]
*  And Israel, this ceasefire also applies to you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  Then you go, okay, Attaboy, finally an American president, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=209.27999999999997s)]
*  Because every time there's a ceasefire, if you don't know this, Israel breaks it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=212.88s)]
*  Is it every single time? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=218.76s)]
*  No. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  Is it almost every time? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=221.24s)]
*  Yes, okay? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=222.24s)]
*  So what Israel did this time was the same as they've always done. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  They're like, ceasefire, great. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=226.36s)]
*  We'll get to keep bombing him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=227.88s)]
*  They dropped 100 bombs on Tehran after the ceasefire. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  That's why Trump was furious. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=235.08s)]
*  He said, he's like, I said ceasefire. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=236.08s)]
*  So I mean, we're gonna give you the details. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=238.4s)]
*  He called Netanyahu, etc., right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=240.12s)]
*  But for an American president to say no, Israel was wrong. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=242.84s)]
*  The framing of the question, the media as always was like, are you gonna yell at Iran [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=247.6s)]
*  for breaking the ceasefire? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=252.24s)]
*  And that's when Trump said, no, they both broke it, and I'm more mad at Israel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=253.84s)]
*  And I've never seen it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=259.08s)]
*  I've never seen it either. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=260.4s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=261.4s)]
*  Yeah, so- Right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=262.4s)]
*  Normally what an American president would do is, yes, Iran broke the ceasefire. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=263.4s)]
*  They'd lie on behalf of Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=265.88s)]
*  They say, yes, Iran broke the ceasefire. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=267.8s)]
*  We hate Iran. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=269.48s)]
*  We're thinking of going back and bombing them again. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=270.48s)]
*  And of course, Israel's right about everything. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=273.04s)]
*  The very fact that an American president is saying that Israel is wrong is unprecedented. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=275.24s)]
*  And it's an enormous relief. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  He could turn around any minute now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=283.76s)]
*  But for now, I'll take it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=286.32s)]
*  Okay, so luckily, the ceasefire appears to be holding for now, okay? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=288.24s)]
*  So as of this morning, the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel confirmed the ceasefire, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=293.48s)]
*  saying that it had achieved its war aims, having removed a dual existential threat from [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=298.32s)]
*  Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  So they want to claim victory. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=308.96s)]
*  And if that's what we need to allow them to do, just so they step back and stop warring [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=310.88s)]
*  with Iran, great. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes, you guys won. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  You guys did everything you wanted to do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister had said that his country would stop its attacks as long as [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=320.32s)]
*  Israel stopped theirs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=324.64s)]
*  In addition to that, and much to the chagrin of neoconservatives like Mark Levin, Trump [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=327.2s)]
*  made clear that the US was not seeking regime change in Iran. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  Now remember, over the weekend, he flirted with the idea of regime change in Iran. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=340.12s)]
*  But I think something happened between then and now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=345.4s)]
*  Likely a contingent of his supporters were like, we didn't vote for this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  You said that you weren't gonna start new wars. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  This is a new war. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=355.4s)]
*  So he might have backed off for that reason. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  But we don't know for sure, obviously. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=358.52s)]
*  Israel has lifted nearly all wartime restrictions on civilian movement and economic activity [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=360.56s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=365.88s)]
*  And the Israeli airport authority said Ben Gurion and Haifa airports are returning to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=367.56s)]
*  full activity. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=373.0s)]
*  They wouldn't do that if they intended to start bombing Iran again. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=374.24s)]
*  But what should be concerning is what the Wall Street Journal also reported about how [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  Israel is now gonna shift its attention back to Gaza. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=384.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, let me be clear. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=386.84s)]
*  The slaughter has continued in Gaza. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  That hasn't stopped. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=389.88s)]
*  Every single day, there's new reports about dozens of civilians getting shelled at, shot, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=391.48s)]
*  killed by IDF soldiers. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=396.64s)]
*  And you also have the chief of staff for the IDF saying, we have concluded a significant [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=399.36s)]
*  phase. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=405.12s)]
*  Now the focus shifts back to Gaza to bring the hostages home and to dismantle the Hamas [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=406.12s)]
*  regime. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=412.0s)]
*  So I'm worried about things getting even more brutal for Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=413.0s)]
*  We can talk about that in just a minute. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=417.9s)]
*  But Cenk, I was unfortunately juggling my mom in the hospital and the news today. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=419.5s)]
*  But tell me about the conversation that Trump had with Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=426.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the sources from both mainstream media and MAGA media saying that he ripped Netanyahu [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=430.9s)]
*  a new a-hole. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=438.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=439.38s)]
*  Okay, and not like when Biden would fake, I am so mad at you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=440.38s)]
*  How big do you want the check to be? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=445.58s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=447.38s)]
*  Now to be fair to Biden, he did not want to attack Iran, right? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=448.38s)]
*  So fair is fair on all of that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=451.22s)]
*  So now, in terms of what's the next part of this is, I'm really worried about it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=453.06s)]
*  So the good news is that it appears Israel actually does want to stop the war with Iran. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=459.8s)]
*  Which I'm super afraid to say because, again, they could change any second now and they [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=466.54s)]
*  usually love war and they leaked intel today, not Israel. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=471.62s)]
*  They leaked it from our intelligence, but half the time that's usually fake Israeli [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=476.42s)]
*  intelligence. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=480.34000000000003s)]
*  Either way, I don't know if it's real or fake, but they say, I don't think we got all the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  uranium. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=484.46000000000004s)]
*  I think we, I'm not saying we gotta go back, but CNN is reporting that and the pundits [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=485.46000000000004s)]
*  are all going, we gotta go back, we didn't get all the uranium. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=491.26s)]
*  God, they're the worst. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=493.82s)]
*  Right, so it's possible that Israel doesn't really want peace and they might want to keep- [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=494.82s)]
*  No, no, it's not Cenk. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=498.46000000000004s)]
*  No, no, no, no, let me finish. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=499.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=500.70000000000005s)]
*  No, there's two potential objectives that they have, right? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=501.98s)]
*  Well, they've stated those two objectives, so they're not potential. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=506.38s)]
*  So the question is, are they gonna try to pursue both or only one of them, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=509.21999999999997s)]
*  And why would they only pursue one of them? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=513.22s)]
*  One of their objectives was not the nuclear stuff. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=515.02s)]
*  They don't have a nuke, they knew that they weren't gonna have a nuke. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=517.3s)]
*  It was for regime change. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=520.06s)]
*  So they didn't get regime change in Iran, they did destroy those facilities and they [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=521.42s)]
*  struck back. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=526.66s)]
*  But are they satisfied with that or are they gonna get greedy and push and push? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=527.78s)]
*  But the second objective, don't lose track of this, is a bigger objective for Israel, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=532.34s)]
*  which is, hey, I just destroyed Hamas, the whole idea of dismantling, literally all Hamas [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=536.46s)]
*  leaders are dead. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  Okay, they destroyed Hezbollah, literally all of Hezbollah's leaders are dead. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=542.1800000000001s)]
*  So they have new leaders because that's what happens when you kill their leaders, right? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=545.58s)]
*  But they decimated them as much as they could possibly decimate them. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=549.0600000000001s)]
*  They cleared out Western Syria, they cleared out Southern Lebanon, and now they've cleared [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=552.52s)]
*  out any offensive capabilities of Iran. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=556.02s)]
*  So now, militarily, there's no one to defend the Palestinians. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=558.94s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=562.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=563.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=564.3s)]
*  So now you could say, hey, they shouldn't have defended them that way, and it's terrorism, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=565.3s)]
*  and it's awful, etc. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=567.66s)]
*  Okay, no problem, okay? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=568.66s)]
*  But that is what was happening. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=570.62s)]
*  And so now without that, Israel thinks free reign, total ethnic cleansing, drive them [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=572.22s)]
*  into the desert. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=578.78s)]
*  And this is, again, not speculation, it's not anti-Semitic, their cabinet voted on it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=580.5s)]
*  And if it's anti-Semitic, then their cabinet is anti-Semitic. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=584.98s)]
*  Because they voted on it that they're going to conquer Gaza and take all of it for Israel [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=587.34s)]
*  to set up greater Israel, right? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=592.22s)]
*  Yes, yep. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=594.0600000000001s)]
*  So now they think, okay, now we've decimated any defense they might have had, and Trump [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=595.0600000000001s)]
*  will let us do whatever we want as long as we're not bothering him. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=600.38s)]
*  So now we get to finish the genocide, okay? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=604.46s)]
*  And so that is probably their number one motive and why they don't mind backing off from Iran [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=607.62s)]
*  at this point. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=612.64s)]
*  But like I said, they might get greedy and go, nah, now we want both. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=615.22s)]
*  We want regime change and to ethnically cleanse Gaza, so they might agitate for more war. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=619.9s)]
*  So we don't know that yet, and we'll see how the developments are going. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=625.92s)]
*  But you could tell that Netanyahu was relatively okay with the ceasefire. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=628.74s)]
*  And by the way, also because he wasn't gonna listen to it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=633.82s)]
*  He thought that ceasefire means they stop attacking, and the American president lies [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=636.78s)]
*  for me and I get to keep attacking, right? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=640.98s)]
*  So he didn't expect that Trump would say, no, you stop too. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=643.42s)]
*  He was genuinely shocked by that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=646.5s)]
*  So okay, but it seems like he might not mind banging away. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=648.5999999999999s)]
*  How do I know that? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=652.5s)]
*  Cuz Mark Levin, who basically is, I mean, he's Israel first, obviously, he's a neo-con, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=653.5s)]
*  he's a war hawk, etc. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=657.86s)]
*  So he was like, this is terrible, I hate the world, right? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=659.86s)]
*  And then afterwards he put out a tweet going, I so hate it, but Netanyahu says it's okay. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=664.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, shut up, bitch. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=670.5s)]
*  So since he's a little puppy dog bitch for Netanyahu, when he goes, that's okay, that [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=672.38s)]
*  means Netanyahu's told him, hey, go tell sucker Americans that it's okay. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=677.5s)]
*  I'm now delivering a message through you, but you're American. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=682.62s)]
*  Go get them, Mark, they still think you're an American, that's hilarious, go ahead. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=685.9s)]
*  Now back to Trump's motivations and what might have persuaded him. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=690.78s)]
*  Polling indicated that Americans felt a certain way about going to war with Iran, bombing [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=696.58s)]
*  Iran. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=701.86s)]
*  Let's take a look at what our good friend Harry Enton had to say about it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=702.86s)]
*  Things are moving quite quickly, but these are initial readings. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=707.54s)]
*  And I will say from a historical perspective, I am surprised that the net approval rating [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=709.7s)]
*  is so low on these strikes. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=713.58s)]
*  And it's in two different polls, it's our CNN SSRS poll, 12 points underwater, one thumbs [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=715.02s)]
*  down. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=719.3000000000001s)]
*  How about the Reuters-Ipsos poll? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=720.3000000000001s)]
*  Look at that, the exact same reading, minus nine points underwater, two thumbs down. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=721.46s)]
*  Normally, these airstrikes rate quite highly, but this one, you go back through history, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=725.78s)]
*  rates is the lowest that I could possibly find on the historical record. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=730.62s)]
*  How about Republican opinion on this? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=734.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's this idea, okay, maybe the MAGA base wouldn't necessarily like this. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  Look, this is Donald Trump's Republican Party. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=741.0200000000001s)]
*  That's why I think it's so important to note GOP on the US airstrikes in Iran, 76% in the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=744.4200000000001s)]
*  average of the two polls approved, compared to just 18% who disapprove. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=748.74s)]
*  Now I will note that is a bit higher than Donald Trump's disapproval rating within the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=752.3000000000001s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=755.62s)]
*  But overall, Republicans are with Donald Trump on this. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=756.74s)]
*  Tucker Carlson be darned. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=760.18s)]
*  Tucker Carlson be darned. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=763.18s)]
*  Now I wish that same poll got into the idea of a protracted or prolonged war with Iran [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=764.66s)]
*  over their alleged nuclear program, which it was never really about their nuclear program. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=771.9s)]
*  How do Republican voters feel about a regime change war? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=776.18s)]
*  I still believe that the majority of Republican voters probably would back a regime change [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=778.86s)]
*  war in Iran. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=783.26s)]
*  But I think the percentage who would not back it would increase significantly if we're talking [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=784.26s)]
*  about a long forever war in an effort to change the regime in Iran. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=789.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, no, this is one I've given to Harry Antin a lot of credit before, but [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=794.26s)]
*  this is one where he's massively biased. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=799.5s)]
*  I don't know if it's him or CNN, but it's comical. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=802.2199999999999s)]
*  So first off, he's like, I don't know why it's so low. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=805.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, what the hell? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=808.0999999999999s)]
*  Of course we should bomb Iran. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=809.5s)]
*  Harry, you're saying it out loud. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=810.9799999999999s)]
*  We can hear you when you say, I don't know why it's so low. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=813.62s)]
*  I need it to be higher. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=816.62s)]
*  Attack, CNN is telling me in my ear attack, okay? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=818.62s)]
*  But that's not even the big tell. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=822.3s)]
*  The big tell was in the second poll. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=824.12s)]
*  They said in a combined average of CNN voters, and I was checking the bottom as he was saying [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=826.82s)]
*  that to see what the source was. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=832.14s)]
*  Because I know in the CNN poll, more Republicans disagree with Trump. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=834.0600000000001s)]
*  They did an average to lessen the effect of their own poll. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=839.18s)]
*  To be fair, every time we use a Harry Antin clip, he does do averages, to be fair. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=843.9s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=850.26s)]
*  Doesn't he? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=851.26s)]
*  No, he sometimes does a poll and he did on this issue too. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=852.26s)]
*  And then he'll say, and most of the polls are like this. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=856.1800000000001s)]
*  Sometimes he'll use averages. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=859.26s)]
*  A lot of times he'll use a single poll. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=860.26s)]
*  I haven't seen him combine just two polls like that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=862.3000000000001s)]
*  To be fair, they were on the same issue. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=865.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=866.58s)]
*  I can see why he would combine them. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=867.58s)]
*  But I noticed that the CNN poll came out more MAGA disagreeing with Trump. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=869.4s)]
*  And I remember thinking because we covered this once before, I wonder if they'll report [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=876.4s)]
*  that. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=881.56s)]
*  And what do they do? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=882.56s)]
*  They didn't report it by itself. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=883.56s)]
*  They put it together with the Reuters poll to drive up the number. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=884.88s)]
*  Because what they're basically saying is, now Donald Trump, if you want to make your [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=887.68s)]
*  base happy, still attack Iran. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=890.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, all right, attacking Iran is a really, really good idea. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=892.12s)]
*  I don't know why these overall numbers are low. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=894.56s)]
*  But remember, among your base, not bad, not bad. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=896.48s)]
*  Keep going, keep going. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=898.64s)]
*  Come on, man, come on. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=899.64s)]
*  You're being super obvious. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=901.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=902.8s)]
*  And this is of course the same CNN that we showed you yesterday. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=903.8s)]
*  Immediately brought on a general to say, Trump was brilliant and decisive. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=906.8s)]
*  And these strikes are great. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=913.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=914.68s)]
*  And I saw another clip just earlier today where they had this hilarious thing. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=916.24s)]
*  They're like Marjorie Taylor Greene, it's in one of our stories today. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=920.76s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene seems to be splitting and saying that the real MAGA is against the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=925.24s)]
*  war and she's attacking neocons. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=929.2800000000001s)]
*  And then CNN goes to a neocon pundit. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=931.36s)]
*  And the pundit goes, there are no neocons. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=934.6s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=937.4000000000001s)]
*  And MAGA does whatever Trump wants and Trump is for the war. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=939.32s)]
*  Okay, okay, so- So why don't we do this? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=942.6s)]
*  Why don't we take a break, come back, and we're gonna show you that clip. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=946.44s)]
*  You're gonna see exactly how it went down. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=949.9200000000001s)]
*  It is an incredible story. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=951.9000000000001s)]
*  There is that split in the Republican Party, the anti-war versus the pro-war. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=953.86s)]
*  And we're gonna provide the proof. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfSYo2PDNw&t=960.1800000000001s)]
