"President Donald Trump this week upended not just his tariff strategy but his trade team.

Former hedge fund manager and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ‚Äî the White House‚Äôs main conduit to beleaguered financial markets ‚Äî is now at the helm, with populist Peter Navarro relegated to the sidelines and Wall Street punching bag Howard Lutnick recast into the role of ‚Äúbad cop,‚Äù according to three people close to the White House, granted anonymity to speak frankly about internal dynamics."

# Trump's Tariff Guy SWEATS BULLETS When Asked About Demotion
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo)
*  Before we let you go, this is just breaking here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=0.0s)]
*  The media says you're in the doghouse with Trump. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=2.4s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=6.12s)]
*  Or is that fake news? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=7.12s)]
*  That's fake news, Jesse. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=11.08s)]
*  Well, I mean, if he says it's fake news and with that genuine laughter, he's just so enjoying [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=12.08s)]
*  this conversation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=17.68s)]
*  I mean, look, I know that I should question public officials. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=18.68s)]
*  I think that maybe I'm just being won over by his natural charm. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=22.44s)]
*  But anyway, that's Peter Navarro, and he's basically been seen to be kind of like the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=25.8s)]
*  avatar of Donald Trump's ideological attachment to the idea of tariffs solving literally every [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=31.36s)]
*  problem. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=37.04s)]
*  If there's anyone who has more faith in tariffs than Trump, it would be Peter Navarro. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=38.04s)]
*  And Navarro calls the reports that he could potentially be about to be thrown under the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  bus fake news. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=46.0s)]
*  But he was also implying right before the tariffs were dialed back that that would literally [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  never happen. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=51.24s)]
*  You could take it to the bank, they're here to stay. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=52.24s)]
*  So he doesn't have a lot of credibility in the public marketplace of ideas or rhetoric. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=54.24s)]
*  But at this point, I think we had talked about the possibility that he could suffer consequences [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=60.260000000000005s)]
*  when Donald Trump retreats. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=63.74s)]
*  What do you think about these reports? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=65.8s)]
*  Yeah, so I got a little bit mixed opinions on it, which is that, so is Navarro fake laughing? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=67.12s)]
*  I don't have a mixed opinion on that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that was wonderfully awkward. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=76.84s)]
*  Yeah, fake news, sure it is, brother. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=79.44s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, he's lost power, best sent the Treasury Secretary's gained power. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=85.52s)]
*  So we'll tell you what that means and the ramifications of that in a second. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=91.08s)]
*  But also, the upside is that they really do have a team of rivals. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=96.6s)]
*  And is that, yeah, but how does that help us? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=104.46s)]
*  Well, I wanna explain that too. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=107.12s)]
*  But first, let's keep making fun of Navarro. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=108.84s)]
*  Yeah, let's definitely do some of that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=110.56s)]
*  It is looking like as of right now, he's been basically silent. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=112.8s)]
*  That's what Politico is saying with Lutnik now being sort of elevated, but best sent [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  probably more so than the others. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  Which feels like kinda like a micro version of the economic sort of argument, the factions [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=126.36s)]
*  that happened during Trump's first term. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=132.2s)]
*  Where again, Trump was interested in starting these trade wars and everything, but then [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=135.04s)]
*  the adults in the room quote unquote, sort of took over. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=138.2s)]
*  It feels like best it's kind of playing like that role in this particular case. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=140.92s)]
*  But the issue for Navarro is that he's very tied in with basically every part of the disaster [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  that we just experienced and we're still seeing the fallout of. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  He apparently was largely behind the way that they came up with those particular tariffs [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=152.92s)]
*  for liberation day, which liberated so many Americans from their retirement. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=158.12s)]
*  So he came up with the formula people are saying, or at least he typed in the prompt [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=163.8s)]
*  to chat GPT that generated the formula. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=168.86s)]
*  And maybe he ordered it Kinko's the little like write up of what it would look like. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=171.34s)]
*  He also insisted that the terrorists would be non-negotiable. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=175.18s)]
*  And so he's really closely tied to it more than basically anyone else. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=178.3s)]
*  Now for Politico's report, they had three anonymous people close to the White House [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=182.44s)]
*  that they had as sources. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  So Jesse Waters is always gonna pretend that it's the media saying something. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=187.12s)]
*  It's the media being told by sources the endless again stream of leakers inside the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=192.08s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=196.84s)]
*  They're the ones that are the source for this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  Now it's also nuanced. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=199.88000000000002s)]
*  They say that Navarro still has Trump's ear. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=201.52s)]
*  Trump respects Navarro's aggressive populism, which for some reason in Politico's reporting [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=205.08s)]
*  doesn't have quotation marks around it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=208.8s)]
*  And that doesn't mean he's at the center of it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  And importantly, they also say in the reporting those sources that the big feud, very public [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  social media feud between Navarro and Elon Musk, that that isn't necessarily what's driving [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=220.24s)]
*  Navarro maybe being put into the backseat here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=224.96s)]
*  I think it's mainly just the fallout of the tariffs themselves. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  But that's the way they're describing it right now. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=231.8s)]
*  Yeah, so remember, whenever there's a story like this, somebody leaked it to this reporter [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  and they had an agenda. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=240.4s)]
*  So what is their agenda here? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  This is the best inside the winning side. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying it's best in himself, but somebody on that side basically saying to Navarro through [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=245.68s)]
*  the press, okay. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=251.24s)]
*  Now they would add in that remember, Elon had nothing to do with this, because that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=254.32s)]
*  person is probably allied with Elon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=258.32s)]
*  So they don't want people thinking that Elon is the real president and he's the one, the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=261.54s)]
*  biggest donor that's making the decisions, etc. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=265.6s)]
*  So no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=268.6s)]
*  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=269.6s)]
*  And by the way, it might not, it might not, but the fact that they said that doesn't mean [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  anything. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  So now Navarro, of course, in my opinion is a grade A clown. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  He's the one that really believed that these nuclear level tariffs would work when no rational [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=280.6s)]
*  person should have thought that they would work. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  He's a Harvard trained economist. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=289.04s)]
*  Dude, that's embarrassing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=291.44s)]
*  My God. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  And remember, he's a terrible guy too. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=295.32000000000005s)]
*  He's the one that came up with, or at least detailed the fake elector plot to overturn [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=297.2s)]
*  the 2020 election in his book. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=302.68s)]
*  He was bragging about it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=304.92s)]
*  You're right that we're bringing these electors, right? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=305.92s)]
*  And they weren't the ones that were elected, but so what? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  And then we steal the election. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=310.0s)]
*  Now he doesn't say steal. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=311.56s)]
*  He has code words for it, but they're very thinly disguised. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=313.68s)]
*  So as bad a guy as you'll find, I'm thrilled that he's lost some power. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=317.0s)]
*  But John's, the part of the reporting that's right that John told you about is that no, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=321.4s)]
*  he's not God. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=325.48s)]
*  He's like Bob. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=326.48s)]
*  You think he's gone? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=327.48s)]
*  He's not gone. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=328.48s)]
*  It's such an old school, what about Bob reference? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=329.48s)]
*  I barely get it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=332.76s)]
*  Bill Murray, check it out. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=333.76s)]
*  So he's right there. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=336.0s)]
*  Okay, anyways, so but look, to be fair, both Republicans and Democrats in the past have [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=338.8s)]
*  pretended to have a team of rivals. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  Obama bragged about it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=348.48s)]
*  They always pick the transportation secretary as the one from the other party. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=349.8s)]
*  They never have any kind of real conversations or debates. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=353.46s)]
*  It's just marketing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything at all. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  And Democrats will pick a Republican defense secretary half the time. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=359.46s)]
*  It's just helping the Republicans seem stronger. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=363.41999999999996s)]
*  There's always such a terrible and useless thing, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=366.94s)]
*  But in this case, they really are rivals. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=369.94s)]
*  Navarro and Musk actually hate each other. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=371.94s)]
*  And Besant is definitely on the opposite side of Lutnick. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=375.02s)]
*  So Lutnick's the commerce secretary. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=377.94s)]
*  He's also lost a lot of power and leverage. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=380.14s)]
*  Now he was on Navarro's side. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=381.9s)]
*  And Besant's the treasury secretary. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=383.85999999999996s)]
*  He's the one that is more of a traditional Republican. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=385.46s)]
*  We came here for the robbery. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=389.46s)]
*  Let's not ruffle the pillows and the upholstery here, right? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  That's nice and easy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=397.38s)]
*  We've got the $5 trillion tax cut robbery incoming. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=398.9s)]
*  Let's all focus on that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=403.02s)]
*  And after we rob the American people, then we can go back to our fights. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=404.41999999999996s)]
*  So my point is, I'm not a fan of Besant either. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=407.32s)]
*  I'm not a fan of any of those guys. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=409.65999999999997s)]
*  But they do have genuine disagreements. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=412.09999999999997s)]
*  And one positive for Trump, I mean, the negatives are obvious, right? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=414.06s)]
*  I mean, what kind of knucklehead thought that those global tariffs are going to work? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=417.97999999999996s)]
*  Okay, but the upside is, when he's getting hurt bad in the polling, in the markets or [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=422.26s)]
*  whatever, he does turn around. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=428.62s)]
*  Like thank God, because if he didn't turn around, his ideas are so catastrophically [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=430.94s)]
*  bad that it would. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=436.78s)]
*  I mean, I don't know that we can recover. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=438.62s)]
*  But yes, once he hits calamity, he goes, all right, okay, I got it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  You, you, you, you're out of the room. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=444.18s)]
*  The other guys, you're in the room now. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=445.9s)]
*  Again, I would hope for a strategy that was a lot more thoughtful than that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=447.62s)]
*  But at least he has the ability to turn around when he's made a massive mistake. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=451.58s)]
*  So we'll take it, I guess. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=454.94s)]
*  Was. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=457.26s)]
*  So I want folks to think about this Navarro and Trump situation. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=459.17999999999995s)]
*  A very close friend of mine has a celebrity client who has a reputation for [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=465.1s)]
*  having a bit of a volatile personality. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  And the guy went out there and did something crazy. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=475.54s)]
*  And I said to my friend, I was like, why didn't you step in front of this? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=477.38s)]
*  And he said to me, Was, you know what I've learned about working with these famous, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  powerful people? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=485.1s)]
*  When they have something in their head that they want to do, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=486.74s)]
*  they're going to shop that idea to the people around them until they find one [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=490.1s)]
*  person that agrees with them and that's what they go with. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=494.38s)]
*  So I'm sure Trump took this tariff thing that he's literally been talking about [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=497.53999999999996s)]
*  since the 80s. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=502.14s)]
*  Back when he was complaining about Japan, you can look this up. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=503.82s)]
*  It was Japan back then who we were worried about their economy someday [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=506.58s)]
*  surpassing us and their cars were taking over our economy and blah, blah, blah. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=510.17999999999995s)]
*  Trump was talking about tariffs back then. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=514.42s)]
*  He's had this seed of we need to do tariffs for 35 years now, right? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=516.4599999999999s)]
*  And so Navarro is the only person that literally takes him up on it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=523.14s)]
*  It's like, yeah, boss, let's do it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=527.02s)]
*  In fact, let's do it in the most extreme, ridiculous, stupid way possible. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=528.58s)]
*  And then he does it and it inevitably fails and Trump's like, this idiot, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=534.1s)]
*  Navarro, I don't know why I let him talk me into this. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=537.98s)]
*  And now he's been sidelined, but make no mistake, it was Trump's idea. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=541.62s)]
*  And Navarro was kind of the only sycophant who was dumb enough to put his [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=545.8199999999999s)]
*  name behind this thing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=550.3s)]
*  And so now he's been sidelined, but he'll never be permanently discarded because [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=551.9s)]
*  Trump deeply, sincerely, almost religiously believes in this tariff regime. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=556.78s)]
*  And so that's what we're going to get, but [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=562.9s)]
*  I think the only thing that we can take be heartened by. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=565.62s)]
*  And Nate Silver in his newsletter either today or yesterday was like, well, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=568.98s)]
*  we shouldn't have the market be the sort of fourth branch of government. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=573.66s)]
*  Ideally, we'd have a freaking leader that had a vision and had a plan. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=578.2199999999999s)]
*  I think this is the first time in a long time though, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=582.38s)]
*  that Trump ran into something that was tangible. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=585.42s)]
*  It's not like some norm that we've established, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=588.8599999999999s)]
*  this intangible that's out in the ether. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=591.8599999999999s)]
*  No, you can't say this, no, you can't align yourself with this person, no. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=594.9s)]
*  No, dude, the way the global economy works, these businesses have to plan months, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=599.6999999999999s)]
*  if not years ahead for how they want to spend, how they want to hire, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=605.78s)]
*  what they want to invest in, what they want to do R&D in. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=609.82s)]
*  And if America, the biggest consumer economy in the world is a basket case, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=612.94s)]
*  the markets are going to be cooked. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=619.0600000000001s)]
*  There's nothing Trump can do about that. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=620.58s)]
*  I think at this point, everybody's wondering the same thing I am. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=622.9s)]
*  Who's that celebrity? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=626.66s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=627.7s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKesIKYpzDo&t=630.82s)]
