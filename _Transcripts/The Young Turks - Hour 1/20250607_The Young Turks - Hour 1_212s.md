TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# TYT Made A Prediction About Pete Buttigieg. IT HAPPENED.
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU)
*  Rage Rock for now says, Anna, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=0.0s)]
*  the dams figured it all out. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=1.98s)]
*  They gave Buttigieg a flannel shirt [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=4.26s)]
*  and he grew a beard and a poof. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  He's a populist for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=10.74s)]
*  the people prime for 28. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=11.94s)]
*  And they say JK, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=13.82s)]
*  we know you're kidding. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=14.68s)]
*  But by the way, did he actually get [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=16.14s)]
*  a flannel shirt because that was [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=17.96s)]
*  my prediction. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=19.68s)]
*  The beard I saw the guy, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=20.84s)]
*  I'm super populist. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=21.98s)]
*  I was just cutting trees down in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=23.42s)]
*  the woods and I had got the beard. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=25.14s)]
*  But if he actually was in a flannel [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=26.86s)]
*  shirt, send that in, okay? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  As we all know, Democrats are having [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=33.44s)]
*  some difficulty attracting men. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=35.199999999999996s)]
*  And so they decided to do [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=36.96s)]
*  the smart thing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  Just put Pete Buttigieg in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=41.08s)]
*  a flannel shirt and that'll do. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=42.48s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=44.36s)]
*  We're going to build something [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  different and better, a vision where [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=47.76s)]
*  our politics and our economics [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=49.8s)]
*  respond to the needs of everyday [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  people, one that leaves us more [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  free and more prosperous than [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=54.92s)]
*  before. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  And more prosperous than before. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=57.02s)]
*  We are very obviously less free and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=59.18s)]
*  less prosperous than we were even [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=61.7s)]
*  a few months ago. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=64.1s)]
*  But this doesn't have to be [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  a one way treader. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=67.7s)]
*  It's all takes, Cenk. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=71.38s)]
*  I'm noticing a trend among [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=74.58s)]
*  Democrat men, okay? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=76.52s)]
*  So you just saw what Pete Buttigieg [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=78.9s)]
*  currently looks like. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=80.94s)]
*  He's no longer clean shaven. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=82.26s)]
*  He's got a little beard thing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  going on, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=85.18s)]
*  flannel shirt situation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=85.72s)]
*  As recline kind of doing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=88.68s)]
*  the same thing, let's keep it real. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=89.64s)]
*  I guess it's like the new hot thing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  among Democrats, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=93.48s)]
*  men in the Democratic Party. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=94.64s)]
*  Yeah, so no, let's not get in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=97.56s)]
*  the way of my victory lap here, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=99.28s)]
*  okay, hashtag Cenk was right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=101.12s)]
*  Okay, so- [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=103.64s)]
*  You're right, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=104.14s)]
*  this story is about you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=104.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=105.4s)]
*  Continue, yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=105.9s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=106.72s)]
*  All right, let's focus here, Anna. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=107.48s)]
*  Focus. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=109.56s)]
*  Okay, so what we're going to do is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=110.68s)]
*  our producers are going to find [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=112.28s)]
*  the clip where I predicted that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=113.84s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg would go in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=115.97999999999999s)]
*  a flannel shirt. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=117.05999999999999s)]
*  And then we're going to add it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=118.22s)]
*  right here when you're watching this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=119.41999999999999s)]
*  later on YouTube. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=121.05999999999999s)]
*  No, we are, we are, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=121.82s)]
*  we're definitely doing that, okay? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=122.82s)]
*  My God. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=124.82s)]
*  No, and here's why. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=125.32s)]
*  Look, as I do with all the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=126.46s)]
*  predictions, mine, Anna's, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=127.66s)]
*  which are the only times that we're, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  I think almost the only times we're [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  wrong is when we disagree with one [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=133.29999999999998s)]
*  another, so one of us has to be [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=135.1s)]
*  wrong, but other than that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=136.76s)]
*  So look, guys, why did I tell you [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=138.82s)]
*  that he was going to put on [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=140.62s)]
*  a flannel shirt? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  Because it was obvious after [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=143.14s)]
*  the election that populism was [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=144.84s)]
*  the correct answer. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=146.82s)]
*  So they would pretend to be [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=148.4s)]
*  populist, and they would do it in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=150.6s)]
*  a way that was all optics, but [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  no substance. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=155.64s)]
*  And Anna, putting the kidding [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=157.76s)]
*  aside, the reason why it's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=159.2s)]
*  important is you have to do real [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=160.64s)]
*  populism. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=162.32s)]
*  Don't let these guys trick you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=163.12s)]
*  into thinking that they're [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=165.04s)]
*  populist when they just decided to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=166.74s)]
*  play that role a minute ago. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=168.94s)]
*  because their consultants told them, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=170.84s)]
*  the polling indicates from [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=172.88s)]
*  the election that the country [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=174.3s)]
*  would like to go in a populist [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=175.66s)]
*  direction. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=177.02s)]
*  So we have a new outfit for you, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=177.54s)]
*  Mr. Buttigieg, okay? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=179.1s)]
*  We're going to need you to grow [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=180.22s)]
*  a beard and we're going to give [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=181.62s)]
*  you a flannel shirt. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=183.08s)]
*  I told you they'd do it, and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=184.1s)]
*  they did it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=185.5s)]
*  Like when I said they would attack [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  Bernie as an anti-Semite, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=188.06s)]
*  even though he's Jewish, and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=189.24s)]
*  they did it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=190.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=191.38s)]
*  Because they're always going to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=192.26s)]
*  attack in the most absurd ways, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=193.82s)]
*  because they're always going to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=195.38s)]
*  support the establishment corporate [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=196.9s)]
*  robot who's never actually going to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=198.74s)]
*  do any of those policies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=200.34s)]
*  And they want to distract you from [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=202.02s)]
*  the actual outside of populists. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5276KKNMU&t=203.88000000000002s)]
