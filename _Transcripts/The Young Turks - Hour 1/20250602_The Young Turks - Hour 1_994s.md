"DUBAI, June 2 (Reuters) - Iran is poised to reject a U.S. proposal to end a decades-old nuclear dispute, an Iranian diplomat said on Monday, dismissing it as a "non-starter" that fails to address Tehran's interests or soften Washington's stance on uranium enrichment.
"Iran is drafting a negative response to the U.S. proposal, which could be interpreted as a rejection of the U.S. offer," the senior diplomat, who is close to Iran's negotiating team, told Reuters."

# Neocons Win This Round of Iran Talks
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg)
*  If you see any hosts on the right or the left, you see any politicians on the right or the left [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=0.0s)]
*  being against this deal, they don't work for us, okay? They have another country's best interest [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  in mind. Neocons won, Cenk, neocons won. That's it. That's it. On social, Trump just posted [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=11.92s)]
*  the split between the America first MAGA Republicans and the neocons in the Republican [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=17.68s)]
*  Party grows wider as President Donald Trump is allegedly poised to sign a new Iran nuclear [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=23.76s)]
*  deal that would allow Tehran to enrich enough uranium to provide their country with power, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=30.32s)]
*  but not to develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Now Iran is an oil producing country. Some might argue why would Iran need nuclear power [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  if they have oil? Well, their entire economy is reliant on exporting that oil and they [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=46.88s)]
*  use nuclear energy in order to provide their citizens with electricity. And so in the original [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=52.64s)]
*  Iran nuclear deal, there was an allowance for Tehran to produce enough enriched uranium [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=57.92s)]
*  in order to provide electricity for their people, but clearly not enough to build a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=64.04s)]
*  nuclear weapon. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=69.28s)]
*  So the nuclear deal proposal the US gave Iran on Saturday would allow limited low level [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=70.8s)]
*  uranium enrichment on Iranian soil for a to be determined period of time. And guess what? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=77.84s)]
*  Believe it or not, the White House isn't denying this. So White House press secretary, Caroline [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  Levitt said in a statement that President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  obtain a nuclear bomb. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=93.84s)]
*  Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=95.52s)]
*  and it's in their best interest to accept it. Out of respect for the ongoing deal, the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=101.8s)]
*  administration will not comment on details of the proposal to the media. Now on Sunday, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  interestingly enough, Witkoff had submitted what was described as preliminary ideas to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  be discussed in the next round of talks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  So under the proposal, Iran would not be allowed to build any new enrichment facilities and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  must dismantle critical infrastructure for conversion and processing of uranium. The [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=125.76s)]
*  proposal also states that Iran would have to halt new research and development on centrifuges. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  Now the Iran deal will create a regional enrichment consortium that meets several conditions, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=137.83999999999997s)]
*  including the fact that Iran won't be allowed to develop domestic enrichment capabilities [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=144.83999999999997s)]
*  beyond those necessary for civilian purposes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=149.27999999999997s)]
*  After signing the agreement, Iran will have to temporarily reduce its enrichment concentration [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=153.04s)]
*  to 3%. This period will be agreed upon in negotiations. Iran's underground enrichment [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=157.52s)]
*  facilities will have to become non-operational for a period of time agreed by the parties. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=163.68s)]
*  And the enrichment activity in Iran's above ground facilities will temporarily be limited [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=168.4s)]
*  to the level needed for nuclear reactor fuel, according to International Atomic Energy Agency [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=172.96s)]
*  guidelines. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=179.96s)]
*  So look, there are Democrats who are criticizing this, I think stupidly, because they're like, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=181.44s)]
*  well, this sounds like Obama's nuclear deal that Trump ripped up. Listen, Trump did rip [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=187.16s)]
*  up the original Iran nuclear deal that was accomplished during the Obama administration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=191.64s)]
*  And that was a bad move, something that we harshly criticized Trump for doing. That being [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=196.8s)]
*  said, we are living in a new era where there are two options before us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=202.04s)]
*  One of them is to go to war with Iran, which is a far superior military power than Iraq. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=206.56s)]
*  And we would do so on behalf of Israel. That would be a disaster. We should wanna prevent [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=212.4s)]
*  that from happening. So if there is a possibility for a new nuclear deal, even if it's the same [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=216.48s)]
*  as Obama's deal, we should be in favor of that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=222.16s)]
*  We should be celebrating that rather than playing this ridiculous partisan hack tribal [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=225.28s)]
*  BS that I keep seeing online. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=233.32s)]
*  I get it, Trump bad. He ripped up the Iran nuclear deal. Yes, that is true. There's a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=234.32s)]
*  possibility for peace. We should be in favor of it and not go in the way of the neo cons [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=238.88s)]
*  who are trying to discourage Trump from doing this. And we'll get to the neo cons in a moment. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=244.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm definitely gonna get to them in a sec because I think I'm gonna say some very [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=247.88s)]
*  harsh things about anyone opposed to this deal. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=252.4s)]
*  So first, let me just clarify my views on it. Just like Ana said, they cannot enrich [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=255.04s)]
*  uranium for military purposes anymore. That means they will not have nukes. They won't [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=260.98s)]
*  be able to process any uranium in Iran going forward. That's an amazing deal. The uranium [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=265.76s)]
*  gets processed outside their country and brought in only for energy purposes. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=272.58s)]
*  And by the way, if you don't know uranium for civil energy purposes is a very different [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=277.14s)]
*  than one that is weaponized for a bomb. Very, very different. That is why many countries [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=282.34s)]
*  have it and we're not freaked out by it, okay? So now, so it's a great deal. It means that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=287.9s)]
*  they will not have nukes and we will have peace. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=294.5s)]
*  What do we give up? Absolutely nothing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=297.44s)]
*  We loosen sanctions on Iran. Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=301.0s)]
*  We loosen sanctions, who cares? We were sanctioning them. It's not like we were getting the money. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=303.68s)]
*  It's not like there's any downside for us. We're just removing some of the sanctions [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=309.72s)]
*  we have on a different country. Doesn't cost us anything. The only thing that it does is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=314.58s)]
*  it prevents war. We were saying to Iran, we're going to attack you, we're gonna kill you, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=319.72s)]
*  destroy you, etc. Now we won't. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=324.48s)]
*  That's how a peace deal works, okay? Now the people opposed to it, Anna's right, some are [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=327.72s)]
*  Democrats who go, yeah, this is like the Obama deal, man. Think great, you should be in favor [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  of it. End of question, period. If you thought the Obama deal was great, which I think it [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=337.54s)]
*  was great, and you think this is similar to the Obama deal, great. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  Then you love it, right? Or are you actually deranged? Like I said, real question. Do you [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=347.44000000000005s)]
*  wanna go to war with Iran just to spite Trump? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=354.16s)]
*  Yes, some people do. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  Like, okay. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=358.32s)]
*  Literally, you'll see them all over the Internet right now. It's amazing. It's literally, I [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=359.32s)]
*  don't care about the two parties at all, okay? I'm so past the partisanship because I see [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  deep flaws with both parties. I know that's gonna offend a lot of people, but it's just [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=368.44s)]
*  how I feel about it. So at this point, we gotta make do with what we've got. And right [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=372.62s)]
*  now the President of the United States, whether people like it or not, is Donald Trump. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=377.64s)]
*  If he is inclined to pursue a peace deal or a new nuclear deal with Iran that prevents [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=382.04s)]
*  war, then we should be happy to see it. Now, do I believe that he's gonna go in that direction [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=388.24s)]
*  for sure? I don't. You never know which direction Trump is gonna go in. This is a very sensitive [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=394.12s)]
*  situation and I'm terrified that he will be swayed by the neocons to go in the wrong direction. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=399.6s)]
*  Yeah, so I wanna get to that as well. First of all, Annie, no, you're definitely not alone. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=406.32000000000005s)]
*  The Democratic Party is pulling at 19%. Yes, there's something deeply wrong with both parties. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=410.8s)]
*  If you're in the blue and on camp where you still think Democratic leadership are geniuses [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=417.0s)]
*  and honest and angels. Hey, listen, man, look, mental health facilities that need customers [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=421.8s)]
*  too. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  So God bless you, okay? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, we don't have them, we don't fund them, so. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  Like angels, you really think that people taking a billion dollars from donors, the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  The people who lost to Donald Trump twice are geniuses? Come on, come on, please stop [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=438.6s)]
*  embarrassing yourself. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=443.46s)]
*  We gotta get to the neocons. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=444.46s)]
*  I know, hold on, I'm getting there. So now look, in terms of direction, if you say, well, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=445.46s)]
*  I don't trust Trump, I don't know that he's gonna get there. What do you wanna do then? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=449.64s)]
*  You wanna encourage him and his base to move in that direction. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=453.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=457.96s)]
*  Not against that direction. So if you go, well, I'm a little skeptical. I mean, I really [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=458.96s)]
*  like the deal, it's like the Obama deal, but I'm a little skeptical. So why don't I just [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=462.4s)]
*  call him a racist? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=466.08s)]
*  Wait, what? Why? Why? I'll just call him a Nazi. Why? Why? If he's going in the right [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=467.24s)]
*  direction, you encourage that, you don't discourage that, unless again, you're a moron, okay? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  So I'm gonna get to the neocons as well, go ahead. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=480.88s)]
*  And by the way, who wants to be in the same room as the neocons? I don't. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=483.56s)]
*  Yeah, tons of Democrats do. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so- [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=489.47999999999996s)]
*  Tons of, because a lot of the Democrats, the ones we're talking about, yes, some are politicians, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  some are real people, etc. The people who are desperate to make sure this deal doesn't [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=494.0s)]
*  happen that are politicians, they don't work for America. They work for Israel. Yeah, I [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=497.76s)]
*  said it, and I'll say it two more times. Any politician opposed to this deal, Republican [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=503.28s)]
*  or Democrat, is a traitor. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=508.56s)]
*  They don't work for America. They wanna have us go to war with Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=511.04s)]
*  Okay, go ahead, go ahead. This deal is excellent. It makes no sense to oppose it unless you [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=516.04s)]
*  got an order from your babysitter, as Thomas Massey puts it. Israeli agents who literally [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=522.36s)]
*  shepherd every congressperson and tell them, you will vote no, you will vote for war. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=529.6s)]
*  Send Americans to die instead of us. They go, yes, sir, yes, sir. Go ahead, go ahead, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=535.4s)]
*  I dare you, be against this peace deal. Go ahead, Ana. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  So Barack Ravid, who reported the story for Axios, hilariously wrote that by making this [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=542.64s)]
*  offer, the Trump administration is risking backlash from its allies on the hill and in [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=547.72s)]
*  Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and dozens of Republican senators [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=554.0s)]
*  have pushed the administration to maintain red lines on zero nuclear enrichment and the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=558.9200000000001s)]
*  full dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=564.32s)]
*  We've gotten orders from Israel. Wow. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=567.76s)]
*  No. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=570.44s)]
*  I didn't know that. I guess we should all bow down to a different country who would [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=571.44s)]
*  like us to lose our lives and our fortune fighting their wars just like they did in [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  Iraq. Okay, we don't care at all. If you see any hosts on the right or the left, you see [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=580.16s)]
*  any politicians on the right or the left being against this deal, they don't work for us. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=587.4s)]
*  Okay? They have another country's best interests in mind. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=593.3199999999999s)]
*  So look, all of the neoconservatives of the Bush era, they didn't just disappear. I mean, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=597.12s)]
*  they're still here. Okay, they were lurking in the shadows for a while because there wasn't [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=602.4s)]
*  a war that they could rally support for. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  But now, all of a sudden, they're coming out and it's very reminiscent of all of the calls [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=607.8s)]
*  to war we were hearing in the lead up to the 2003 Iraq invasion. So let me give you some [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  specific examples. You have Mark Dubowitz, who is the CEO of the Foundation for Defense [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=618.0s)]
*  of Democracies. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=624.6s)]
*  He writes on X, President Trump, all of his top officials, 52 GOP senators and 177 House [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=626.24s)]
*  Republicans demanded zero enrichment capability and full dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=634.12s)]
*  Now the US is offering a deal that lets Iran keep enriching. My understanding is the enrichment [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=640.36s)]
*  would happen offsite out of the country, right? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=647.16s)]
*  So let me explain what that group is. They changed their name to Defense of Democracy [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=651.56s)]
*  because they wanted to pretend that it was Israel and America are in it together, we're [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=655.36s)]
*  protecting democracy together. Nonsense, that's the Israeli lobby. So that's AIPAC and the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=659.16s)]
*  other groups, that their whole job is to control America on behalf of Israel. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=664.32s)]
*  That's literal. That's the only reason they're formed, so that America follows Israel's orders. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=669.24s)]
*  So there is no other reason for AIPAC or anyone in that group. So that's why he's lying. There [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=675.32s)]
*  Iran will not be able to enrich uranium at home going forward. And in terms of bringing it down [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=681.52s)]
*  to zero, tons of countries have nuclear energy with low enriched uranium. Just because it's the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=686.8s)]
*  same word doesn't mean that it's the same concept. It is completely different to enrich it at a much, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=692.4799999999999s)]
*  much, much higher level for weapons. And we are all aware of that. And that is why [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=697.68s)]
*  the international community does not mind sending, having Iran having a nuclear energy program [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=702.16s)]
*  like tons of countries in the world. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=709.76s)]
*  Right. Now, Mark Levin, my favorite neocon who thinks even uttering the word neocon is [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=711.84s)]
*  anti-Semitic. Of course, speaking is anti-Semitic unless you agree with Mark Levin and bow your head [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=718.24s)]
*  to Israel. Mark, you should, you know what, if you love Israel so much, why don't you go? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=724.72s)]
*  He- I mean, you'll get them to vote for killing a lot more Palestinians. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  So, right, the money's here and you need to send the money over there. I got you. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=733.84s)]
*  Okay. So he writes, can this be true? We will know very soon, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=737.28s)]
*  Senate must use its treaty power either way. In other words, F the executive branch, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=741.28s)]
*  we should have Congress do what it needs to do. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=745.92s)]
*  That's really important. Yeah. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=748.56s)]
*  Cuz that's Mark Levin saying, I give up on Trump, he might actually want peace. So all you bought [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  bitches in Congress, all the ones we purchased. By the way, out of the 535 people in Congress, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  502 take money from APAC and affiliated groups. Israel didn't purchase them for no reason. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=763.52s)]
*  This is Mark saying, I'm now activating the Israeli agents inside the US government. You better vote [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=770.24s)]
*  for war and go, and if you're a Republican, we don't care about even what Trump says. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=777.12s)]
*  You'll lose your goddamn job if you need to, okay? But you work for Israel, not America. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=782.0s)]
*  All right, one guy from the red state says, if you spent a decade trashing the JCPOA, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=787.12s)]
*  that was the original Iran nuclear deal. And we all did because it was garbage, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=792.0s)]
*  then don't be the clown that supports this just because it's your side. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=797.6s)]
*  No, there is definitely a faction within the Republican base, the so-called America first [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=802.24s)]
*  mega Republicans who don't want war. I know it's hard for the neocons to accept that there's a huge [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=811.36s)]
*  portion of the Republican base that doesn't want to go to war with Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=818.72s)]
*  But they exist, and honestly, it's one of the more positive developments I've seen within [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=824.64s)]
*  the Republican party. I have a tremendous amount of respect for those particular voters who can see [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=829.12s)]
*  clearly, who know what's going on here, and flat out reject the neoconservatives of the Bush era. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=835.28s)]
*  Probably because the neoconservatives of the Bush era sent their family members to war in Iraq, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=841.0400000000001s)]
*  multiple deployments, Afghanistan as well. And what do we get for it? Taliban still in [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=845.76s)]
*  control of Afghanistan. We lost over 4,000 soldiers in Iraq, hundreds of thousands of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  civilians in Iraq died as a result of that war, complete disaster. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=857.12s)]
*  Yeah. So look, if you're back to the tribalism inside the US, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=860.56s)]
*  if you're on the Democratic side and you say, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, I just, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=866.8s)]
*  I hate Trump, I hate MAGA, and I have a closed mind, I don't wanna hear it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=871.2s)]
*  You're totally wrong. It's not a little portion of MAGA, it's a big portion of MAGA that is anti-war. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=874.88s)]
*  So I know a lot of people don't wanna hear that. No, I don't want the truth, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=880.72s)]
*  I don't want reality. I like hating so much. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=884.24s)]
*  Neocons won, Cenk. Neocons won, that's it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=887.2s)]
*  What up? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=889.36s)]
*  That's it. On Truth Social, Trump just posted, the auto pen should have stopped Iran a long time ago [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=889.92s)]
*  from enriching under our potential agreement. We will not allow any enrichment of uranium. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=896.24s)]
*  Okay, that's it. So he got bribed. So this was all a matter of just getting bribed. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=901.12s)]
*  Congratulations, Donald Trump. By the way, I was in the middle of giving MAGA credit. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=905.52s)]
*  Now let's see if they earn it, okay? So are you now going to switch your position entirely [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=909.84s)]
*  and go, well, daddy Trump got bribed, so Israel first. Mark Levin is probably just ecstatic now. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=915.2s)]
*  I told you we were gonna buy him and we bought him, right? So now, by the way, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=923.6s)]
*  prepare your sons and daughters for war because Israel demands us to go to war. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=927.92s)]
*  By the way- And by the way, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=932.4799999999999s)]
*  and I wanna get to Biden because Biden, what did you do? Did you put us back into Obama peace deal? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  That he promised to do when he was- And he's the thing of the world. You were [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=940.0799999999999s)]
*  his vice president, why didn't you put us back in? No, because you work for Israel. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=943.04s)]
*  And now Trump says, just kidding, I'm not the president of America and I don't believe in [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=947.04s)]
*  America first. I believe in America dead last and whoever the hell bribes me, way above them. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=952.4s)]
*  Now you see right in the middle of the story as the story breaks, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  you see me in favor of Trump or opposed to Trump. It depends on what he does. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=961.68s)]
*  Please care about policy. Please stop being egomaniacs on both sides. So now I turn around [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=968.72s)]
*  my criticism to MAGA. Go ahead, MAGA, go ahead, show me who you are. Are you actually anti-war [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=975.36s)]
*  or are you, no, Trump got bribed by AIPAC. We're good, we're good. Show me who you are. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnROeqnZhg&t=981.44s)]
