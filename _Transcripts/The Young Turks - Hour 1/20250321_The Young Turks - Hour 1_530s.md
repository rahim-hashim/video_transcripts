TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# AOC Delivers POWERFUL Message To Democratic Party Leaders
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U)
*  This isn't just about Republicans either. We need a Democratic party that fights harder for us too. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=0.0s)]
*  So that is AOC criticizing the Democratic party while participating in Bernie Sanders [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=7.68s)]
*  fight oligarchy tour. She's saying that the sort of Democrats that are going to do well are the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=18.64s)]
*  brawlers who actually stand up to and push back against the Republicans. And that certainly seems [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=23.36s)]
*  to be what the voters out there, both Democrats and independents want to see. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=28.0s)]
*  Interestingly, Bernie has a slightly different take, which we will get to. But you should know [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=33.36s)]
*  that that rally, like past instances of Bernie's rallies on this tour, drew a lot of people. This [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=37.28s)]
*  is in Tempe, Arizona, hit 15,000 people, which is certainly a lot. And understand that while [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  AOC and Bernie are drawing crowds, the Democratic party in general is not doing well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Democrats are now underwater with their own voters in approval ratings. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=54.88s)]
*  It's their worst poll since Quinnipiac started back in 2009, hardly a good spot. Only 40% of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=59.6s)]
*  Democrats approve of the job performance of congressional Democrats compared to 49% who [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=67.68s)]
*  disprove. Last year, 75% approved, so they've lost about half of those who approved of them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=72.4s)]
*  And we can sort of understand why. Now, some people are speculating that this could potentially [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=79.2s)]
*  create an opening like we saw during the Tea Party for the Republicans, where the frustration [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=84.16s)]
*  with the Republican Party gave way to a remaking of the party. And if that were to happen, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=89.2s)]
*  maybe it's more in an AOC or Bernie Sanders direction. That said, when you poll potential [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  voters, what do people think? Well, 45% of Democrats want their party to become more moderate, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=102.0s)]
*  29% more liberal, 22% stay the same. And that's the sort of graphic that we draw from articles [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=107.44s)]
*  like in Politico that Politico will write and it's supposed to mean something. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=115.12s)]
*  What the hell does that mean? When you poll thousands of people and some say they want the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  Democratic party to be more moderate, what does that mean? And do we think that means one thing? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  Do we think that people are thinking about the same sorts of policies when they say that? I hate [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=129.84s)]
*  terms like moderate. It is so pointless. On what? On economic policy, on combativeness, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=133.52s)]
*  on culture, on foreign, but it means basically nothing. But what we do know is that Democrats [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=140.24s)]
*  don't like the current Democratic Party and leadership. And obviously there's been a lot [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=146.88s)]
*  of criticism of Chuck Schumer in particular. Now, Bernie and AOC, they haven't actually [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  asked him to step down, which I think is interesting. But a couple of House Democrats have. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  As I said though, Bernie actually thinks that more people need to run as independents rather [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=160.56s)]
*  than as Democrats to remake the Democratic Party, which is obviously that's more akin to what he has [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=166.4s)]
*  done historically, but it's a different strategy than AOC. Yas, I'm gonna go to you first. What do [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=171.44s)]
*  you think about these different critiques? Yeah, okay. So I swear I did a video for Rebel HQ [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=175.6s)]
*  earlier today and I almost said this. I got very right up to saying maybe there's like a split in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  the Dem Party that no one's really talking about. I was talking about how the left doesn't have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=189.36s)]
*  strong leadership right now and I don't really see how it could. I don't know what a Democratic [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=194.08s)]
*  leader akin to what Donald Trump is to the Republicans could even, I don't even know if [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  that is even possible for the left because what would that person even look like? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  What would they stand for? There are so many issues that Democrats are split on. We're far [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=208.56s)]
*  too spread too far across the political spectrum first of all. But that aside, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=213.76s)]
*  we're split between the Dem leadership and then also the Dem voters, right? The Dem leadership [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=219.76s)]
*  right now, they're courting big money donors, they're courting billionaires, they're becoming [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=224.48s)]
*  more corporatized. The Democratic voters really don't like that because our voice is being [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  drowned out by these billionaires, which is exactly what has already happened on the right. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=235.44s)]
*  Also, there's a big split between what people think should happen between Israel and Palestine. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=239.68s)]
*  The voters think one thing and the government is really, really backing the other thing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=245.52s)]
*  And there's several other issues just like that. So whenever we talk about a Democratic leader, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=250.0s)]
*  someone's gonna come who's gonna take on Donald Trump or whoever comes after him. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what that person would even look like. We, the progressives, we have Bernie Sanders and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  then arguably AOC would be his successor. But a lot of people don't like AOC for various reasons. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=267.12s)]
*  And Bernie, the establishment doesn't like him. So even if Bernie is the most perfect [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=273.36s)]
*  candidate that we could ask for as progressives, he's not gonna make it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=278.72s)]
*  He's tried several times and he wasn't able to make it because the Democratic establishment [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=282.8s)]
*  was anti-Bernie. And even within Congress, a lot of the things that he stands for, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=286.72s)]
*  a lot of the things that he says, the other Democrats will either say, no, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=291.36s)]
*  we don't agree with that or they'll just stifle his voice. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=296.32s)]
*  So we've seen it several times before. It's not looking like it's getting any better. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=298.96s)]
*  If anything, the party seems to be splitting even more. And people are getting very, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=304.08s)]
*  very frustrated because it feels like at this point we have no representation in our own [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=308.08s)]
*  government, right? We have all these ideals and all these values and there is so much public [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=312.48s)]
*  support behind these ideas. But whatever they do once they get into Congress is whatever they [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  want to do. So they don't have to listen to us once they've already gotten our vote. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=321.76s)]
*  And they've gotten our vote thus far because we vote for the Democrats because we keep thinking [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  that if we get enough of them in Congress, then things are gonna shift in our favor, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=332.96s)]
*  shift one way that we would like it to shift, but that hasn't proven to be the case. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=337.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, they keep texting us and asking us for money because they need one more donation [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=342.24s)]
*  just to save democracy. My donation is gonna save democracy. That's what they tell me in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=347.44s)]
*  these text messages that they blow my phone up with. So it's very frustrating. It's very [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=351.84s)]
*  disingenuous and it doesn't encourage me to want to participate in government in that way. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=356.32s)]
*  Jordan? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=363.44s)]
*  Yeah, on the Tea Party point, we have to recognize while there was discontent [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  on the right, that was a well-funded, largely astroturfed movement. And we will not see the same [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  money on the left to prop up something like this. While there are progressive advocacy [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  organizations, their budgets pale in comparison to the Koch brothers who helped fuel that movement. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=384.8s)]
*  And when you look at somewhat analogous movements over the past, say decade, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  you have the George Floyd uprising. What was that met with? State violence. You have Occupy. What [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=398.96s)]
*  was that met with eventually? State violence. You're not going to be able to build something [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=404.08s)]
*  like that. I'm not saying you shouldn't try, but you have to recognize and then if we get to it [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=408.64s)]
*  later, but just generally Trump's comments about the Gaza protests on college campuses. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, deport them. We're going to put these people in jail. There's other movements happening right [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=418.0s)]
*  now. They're threatening to charge people with acts of terrorism. So it would be curious in [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=422.88s)]
*  this environment to see how a movement like that actually manifests and what it would be met with. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=427.92s)]
*  Because people who are protecting the status quo will use all the tools at their disposal [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=432.88s)]
*  to crush a populist movement in this country. And that includes the Democratic Party leadership. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=438.48s)]
*  But on that polling, I think it's important to point out, people are saying, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=443.76s)]
*  oh, I think the moderate direction is the right direction for the future. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=447.36s)]
*  What is that? You're saying John, what does that mean? Can you name a single policy [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=450.24s)]
*  that Democrats are united around that defines the party? Because I can't. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=454.64s)]
*  We couldn't even in the last presidential cycle, especially now. What do they stand for? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=459.12s)]
*  You can't even get unified opposition to Trump passing a budget bill. What are we doing? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=464.4s)]
*  So there's an opportunity here. I'm glad to see AOC and Bernie are hitting the road, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=469.92s)]
*  but they're filling arenas for these speeches. And it shows there's a demand for it. They want [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=475.2s)]
*  someone coming out and talking about these things. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  Ro Khanna is doing a mini tour in California. TYT is going to be airing it this weekend. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  And you're seeing things like this start to pop up. But unless the whole party is behind it and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  leaning into it, or most of the party, it's just going to be more of the same. You've got the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=494.0s)]
*  progressive wing doing their thing. And then the rest of the Democrats are just [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6d-MFVx2U&t=498.32s)]
