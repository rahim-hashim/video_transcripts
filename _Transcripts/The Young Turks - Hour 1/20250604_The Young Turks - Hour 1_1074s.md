TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Karine Jean-Pierre Hawks Book, Leaves Democratic Party
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI)
*  She's breaking every record on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=0.0s)]
*  irony. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1.84s)]
*  She's like, I am becoming [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=2.68s)]
*  an independent because the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=4.32s)]
*  Democratic Party wanted to be [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  independent of Joe Biden. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=8.06s)]
*  And I hate that, I think they [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=10.06s)]
*  should have been completely [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=11.88s)]
*  dependent on our feeble mad king. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=13.68s)]
*  The person who was pretending to be [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  serving the presidency in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=18.3s)]
*  an independent fashion, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=19.82s)]
*  when in reality Anthony Blinken was [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  running foreign policy and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Jill Biden was running domestic [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=24.44s)]
*  policy and I was their mouthpiece. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=26.04s)]
*  And the fact that we were not [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=28.52s)]
*  dependent enough on them makes me [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=29.84s)]
*  want to be really independent. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=31.3s)]
*  I've never seen irony that thick. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=33.24s)]
*  Hi, I'm Karine Jean-Pierre and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=35.08s)]
*  I am the author of a new book [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=36.8s)]
*  that's coming out this fall called [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=38.28s)]
*  Independent. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=40.16s)]
*  People that come up to me, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=41.6s)]
*  strangers that come up to me, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=42.88s)]
*  the number one question they ask me [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=44.44s)]
*  is Karine, how do we get out of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=46.28s)]
*  this? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=47.8s)]
*  How do we protect our democracy? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  Here's the truth and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=50.4s)]
*  here's how I will lay it out to you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  I think we need to stop thinking in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=53.92s)]
*  boxes and think outside of our [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=56.36s)]
*  boxes and not be so partisan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=58.76s)]
*  Do you? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=64.12s)]
*  Now after years of being a Joe [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=65.24s)]
*  Biden's biggest defender and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=67.24s)]
*  also a mouthpiece for [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=69.4s)]
*  the Democratic Party, former White [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=71.0s)]
*  House Press Secretary Karine Jean [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=73.68s)]
*  Pierre is now leaving the Democratic [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  Party to become an independent. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=78.36s)]
*  And I don't believe her. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=80.6s)]
*  Okay, so she might now allegedly [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=82.4s)]
*  identify as an independent, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=84.52s)]
*  her actions don't really show it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=86.48s)]
*  Nonetheless, this shocking news [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=88.92s)]
*  comes as she announces her new [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=91.32s)]
*  book which is titled Independent, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=93.44s)]
*  a look inside a broken White House [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=95.96s)]
*  outside the party lines. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=98.4s)]
*  It seems like this is a marketing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  effort for her book. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=102.36s)]
*  And look, congratulations, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=104.2s)]
*  everyone's talking about this, but [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=105.68s)]
*  mostly dunking on both the Democrats [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=107.52s)]
*  and the former White House [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=109.32s)]
*  Press Secretary. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=110.56s)]
*  So it's described by the publisher [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=111.24s)]
*  as a groundbreaking revelatory [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=113.44s)]
*  assessment of America's broken [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=116.0s)]
*  two party system. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=117.96s)]
*  And we do have a broken two party [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=119.2s)]
*  system. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=120.84s)]
*  The question is, does Karine Jean [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=121.36s)]
*  Pierre really believe the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=123.16s)]
*  Democratic Party is broken or [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  is there something else going on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  here? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  And it seems pretty ironic to be [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=128.2s)]
*  honest with you considering the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=130.16s)]
*  fact that her entire job was to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=132.04s)]
*  defend Joe Biden no matter what. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=133.96s)]
*  How did she not know that he was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=137.4s)]
*  suffering from severe cognitive [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=139.2s)]
*  decline? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=141.24s)]
*  Like Cenk, this is the thing that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=141.84s)]
*  really stands out to me about all [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=143.76s)]
*  these, I'm going to be nice and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=145.48s)]
*  not call them grifters. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  I am not calling them grifters, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=149.0s)]
*  but all these people who are out [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  there writing these books and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=153.0s)]
*  pretending like they weren't part [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  of the problem. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  How does this make any sense? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, it doesn't. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=160.44s)]
*  It's bad in two different ways. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=161.64s)]
*  And then we'll talk about whether [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  we should take yes for an answer. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=165.56s)]
*  In fact, we got that poll up on [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  tyt.com. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=168.56s)]
*  I think it's a good one. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=169.12s)]
*  You know why? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=170.2s)]
*  I came up with it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=170.72s)]
*  How do you feel about Karine Jean [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=172.28s)]
*  becoming an independent? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=174.0s)]
*  A, I'll take yes for an answer. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=175.12s)]
*  B, too late, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=177.12s)]
*  should have done it when it [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=177.84s)]
*  counted. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=179.0s)]
*  C, she's a traitor for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=179.52s)]
*  leaving the Democratic Party. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=180.72s)]
*  Curious what you guys think? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=182.84s)]
*  tyt.com on that one. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=184.12s)]
*  Okay, so look, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  here's what I think. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=187.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=189.36s)]
*  No, you're not going to share what [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=189.88s)]
*  you think. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  I got to give them the information [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=191.56s)]
*  with what she's saying in her [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  books and the drama that's playing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  out with the Democrats. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=195.32s)]
*  No, I'm just going to preview that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=196.4s)]
*  there's two parts in which this is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=198.4s)]
*  a bit of a disaster, okay? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=200.56s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=202.8s)]
*  Which two parts are those? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=203.32s)]
*  I don't know, I'm going to tell [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=204.72s)]
*  you after and it gives you all [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=205.68s)]
*  the details. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=206.72s)]
*  Thank you, thank you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=207.6s)]
*  All right, so the publisher's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=208.76s)]
*  description reads, in a country [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=210.64s)]

*  in my opinion, was ridiculous in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=256.64s)]

*  Biden initially announced that he'd [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=261.48s)]

*  should have said something and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=267.56s)]

*  against it, but the one thing for [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=288.32s)]
*  it is, that is a spectacularly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=290.28s)]
*  unique argument that she's leaving [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=292.55999999999995s)]
*  the Democratic Party because they [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  pushed out Biden, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=297.47999999999996s)]

*  If he just stuck with Biden, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=301.0s)]
*  the young and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=302.67999999999995s)]
*  dynamic president that we had, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=303.52s)]
*  maybe she could have stayed [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  a Democrat. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=307.08s)]
*  But now she's got to be an independent [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=307.84s)]
*  with Democratic Party acting like [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=311.32s)]
*  Is that really the argument? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=311.84s)]
*  Because that seems like I can't [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=313.28s)]
*  believe that anyone would actually [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  believe that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=317.79999999999995s)]
*  So it's totally unclear to me what [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=319.12s)]
*  she means by independent. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=321.52s)]
*  So look, that is consistent with [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=324.44s)]
*  her previous gripes, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=327.0s)]
*  which she shared publicly. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=328.84s)]
*  Here she is back in February [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=331.6s)]
*  complaining about Democrats [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=333.2s)]
*  attacking Biden. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=334.96s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=336.2s)]
*  Personally, I think what was the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=338.28s)]
*  toughest thing to see in the three [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=340.8s)]
*  weeks was there was a disconnect [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=343.36s)]
*  for me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=346.0s)]
*  What was happening with leadership [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=348.6s)]
*  in the Democratic Party and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=351.16s)]
*  how it was truly, as my former [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=353.14s)]
*  colleague, communications director [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=355.28s)]
*  Ben LeBolt said, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=358.04s)]
*  it was a firing squad. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=359.36s)]
*  And I had never seen anything like [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=361.12s)]
*  it before. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=363.08s)]
*  I'd never seen a party do that in [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=363.68s)]
*  the way that they did. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=366.36s)]
*  And it was hurtful and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=369.52s)]
*  sad to see that happening. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=371.28s)]
*  A firing squad around a person who [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=373.4s)]
*  I believe was a true patriot. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=376.76s)]
*  It was truly, truly unfortunate. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=379.04s)]
*  And I think it hurt us more than [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=381.32s)]
*  I think folks realized. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=385.0s)]
*  You had never seen that before? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=391.16s)]
*  Were you asleep in 2016 and 2020? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=393.32s)]
*  You've never seen the Democratic [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=397.08s)]
*  Party engage in a firing squad [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=399.12s)]
*  against an intended target, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=401.0s)]
*  like Bernie Sanders, for instance? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=402.88s)]
*  Did you think that Biden would be [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=405.6s)]
*  safe because he was a, I don't know, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=407.52s)]
*  a veteran of the Democratic [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=409.72s)]
*  establishment? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=411.36s)]
*  This is unbelievable, but [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=412.44s)]
*  go ahead, don't buy her book. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=414.56s)]
*  Please don't give her money. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=417.76s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=419.12s)]
*  Go ahead, Cenk. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=419.96s)]
*  Okay, so many amazing things in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=421.32s)]
*  here. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=424.0s)]
*  It was hurtful. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=425.0s)]
*  Your feelings were hurt that your [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=427.08s)]
*  boss was not going to get to be [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=429.6s)]
*  the candidate so [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=431.84s)]
*  that you could continue your [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  employment with him and your power [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=435.0s)]
*  and status and fame. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=437.24s)]
*  And because that hurt your fee [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  fees, now you're going to become [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=440.66s)]
*  an independent. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=442.56s)]
*  And so wait, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=443.52s)]
*  let me understand this better. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=444.24s)]
*  She says a true, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=446.04s)]
*  Joe Biden was a true patriot. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=447.32s)]
*  A true patriot says, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=450.68s)]
*  democracy is on the line if my [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  opponent wins. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  I am in obvious mental decline. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=454.64s)]
*  I cannot finish the sentence. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=457.0s)]
*  And in the debates, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=458.88s)]
*  I will say that we defeated Medicare [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=460.16s)]
*  and literally nothing else I say [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=462.84s)]
*  will be understandable by anyone [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=464.84s)]
*  else. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  I will hand this election to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=467.56s)]
*  Donald Trump, who I think is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  a fascist and will destroy America. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=471.24s)]
*  Just on the off, off, off chance [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=473.71999999999997s)]
*  that I might retain my own personal [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=476.56s)]

*  That's your true patriot. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=481.2s)]
*  That's why you caught feelings. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=482.84s)]
*  That's why you left [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=484.68s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=487.47999999999996s)]
*  Look, I think that coming out as [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=488.12s)]
*  an alleged independent also is [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=491.4s)]
*  a calculated move given how many [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=494.44s)]
*  American voters now identify as [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=497.48s)]
*  independent. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=500.52s)]

*  Jill Biden was running domestic [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=644.04s)]

*  I think that the establishment [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=667.96s)]

*  an independent spirit. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=675.76s)]
*  Right, right, right, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=677.36s)]
*  it's so crazy. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=678.84s)]
*  Now look, this has led to quite a [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=680.88s)]
*  bit of infighting among [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=682.6s)]
*  establishment Democrats because [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=683.84s)]

*  apparently didn't pan out Cenk, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=810.44s)]
*  what a shame. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=812.72s)]
*  Yeah, so that's what this whole [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=813.84s)]
*  independence sticks about, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=815.96s)]
*  it's a media play. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=818.0s)]
*  Because the media now loves [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=820.28s)]
*  independence theoretically, right? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=821.84s)]
*  In reality, those independence have [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=824.44s)]
*  to serve the establishment. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=826.0400000000001s)]
*  So by the way, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=827.08s)]
*  now that I thought about it that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=827.9200000000001s)]
*  way, it might work. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=829.5600000000001s)]
*  It might be perfect for [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=831.12s)]
*  like San Andeco. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=832.2s)]
*  Now here's a person who is a true [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=833.36s)]
*  independent. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=836.6800000000001s)]
*  And then she comes on and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=838.44s)]
*  makes every disgusting [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=839.8000000000001s)]
*  establishment point you could [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=841.32s)]
*  imagine, and CNN gets to declare [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=843.08s)]
*  her an independent. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=845.0s)]
*  So maybe well played, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=846.64s)]
*  because she's not playing to us. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=847.88s)]
*  She's playing to the Washington, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=850.08s)]
*  New York crowd. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=851.6s)]
*  She has absolutely no base in [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=852.32s)]
*  the actual world, right? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=854.2800000000001s)]
*  And so if there were any KJP fans, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  they would be attached to the Biden [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=859.44s)]
*  team and the Kamala Harris team. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=862.36s)]
*  But those guys love [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=865.52s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=867.0s)]
*  So the fact that she's leaving [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=869.28s)]
*  the Democratic Party would be [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=870.4s)]
*  burning a bridge with them. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=871.52s)]
*  So the only people left are TV [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=872.88s)]
*  executives, and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=874.56s)]
*  that's what this is all about. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=875.52s)]
*  And how loyal were you to Biden as [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=877.56s)]
*  you were talking to a publicist [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=879.36s)]
*  about a book you were going to [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=881.04s)]
*  write about Biden? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=882.64s)]
*  Like I did it because I am true. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=883.96s)]
*  By the way, call me later, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=888.52s)]
*  I'm writing a book about it. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=889.4s)]
*  Okay, sure, whatever. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=890.48s)]
*  So finally, Ana, let me just say [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=892.64s)]
*  the two reasons why I'm personally [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=893.96s)]
*  opposed to it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=895.32s)]
*  So do it when it counts, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=897.1600000000001s)]
*  that's obvious, right? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=898.7600000000001s)]
*  So don't tell me that all of a [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=901.0s)]
*  sudden you're an independent and [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=902.2800000000001s)]
*  you're willing to call out both [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  parties, including the Democratic [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=905.0400000000001s)]
*  Party, when you were literally [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=906.5200000000001s)]
*  the mouthpiece for [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=909.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, when it counted and [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=911.08s)]
*  you did nothing, in fact, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=912.1600000000001s)]
*  you didn't do nothing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=913.36s)]
*  You were the person who packaged up [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=914.7600000000001s)]
*  the lies and tried to feed it to us. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=917.0s)]
*  Okay, and then secondly, and [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=919.48s)]
*  this one might surprise you guys. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=921.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't like the idea of people [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=923.7199999999999s)]
*  like her, not Ana and others. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=925.48s)]
*  You're in media, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=927.1999999999999s)]
*  you're a regular person, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=928.28s)]
*  you can do anything you like, and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=929.88s)]
*  I 100% get the rise of independence, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=931.8s)]
*  100%. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=934.0s)]
*  But if you're a big part of [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  the Democratic Party and [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=936.1999999999999s)]
*  she was the press secretary for [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=937.1999999999999s)]
*  the President of the United States, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=938.56s)]
*  why don't you stick around and [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=940.3199999999999s)]
*  try to help fix it, right? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=941.76s)]
*  So I mean, that's what I'm doing. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=943.88s)]
*  I'm trying to say, look, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=945.28s)]
*  I don't think we should go in [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=946.36s)]
*  the establishment direction. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=947.48s)]
*  I don't think we should go in [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=948.76s)]
*  the identity politics direction. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=949.76s)]
*  I think we should go in [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=951.3199999999999s)]
*  the populist direction. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=951.88s)]
*  So I'm staying and [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=952.64s)]
*  I'm trying to make that happen. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=953.68s)]
*  Instead she goes, I don't know, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=955.76s)]
*  maybe I could angle for [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=958.24s)]
*  a media play if I'm independent. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=959.8s)]
*  I mean, the first question I would [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=962.96s)]
*  ask her is independent how? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=964.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, 100%, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=968.76s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=970.16s)]
*  I'm going to read one comment here [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=971.8s)]
*  from one of our viewers. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=973.6s)]
*  This is embedded dude who says, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=975.16s)]
*  I'm an independent now, but [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=976.92s)]
*  I probably should go back to being [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=978.52s)]
*  a registered Democrat so [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=980.4399999999999s)]
*  I can vote in the primaries. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=981.92s)]
*  That may be important. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=983.68s)]
*  So I live in California, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=985.04s)]
*  we don't have open primaries, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=986.16s)]
*  which means if I want to vote in [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=987.6s)]
*  the Democratic primary, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=989.0s)]
*  I do have to be a registered [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=990.16s)]
*  Democrat. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=991.4s)]
*  I know this sounds ridiculous, but [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=992.2s)]
*  I hate the current Democratic party [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=994.4s)]
*  so much that I refuse to give them [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=996.72s)]
*  my registration until I need to be [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=998.8s)]
*  a registered Democrat to vote in [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1001.04s)]
*  the primaries and then I'll go [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1003.08s)]
*  back to being an independent. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1004.8s)]
*  I know that sounds crazy, but [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1006.56s)]
*  I'm willing to go through [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1007.96s)]
*  that process, yeah. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1009.16s)]
*  I can't stand them, Cenk. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1010.2s)]
*  I can't stand them, okay? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1011.52s)]
*  They're so pathetic and [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1013.88s)]
*  so embarrassing. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1015.32s)]
*  I feel embarrassed to see my [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1016.96s)]
*  registration as a Democrat. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1018.16s)]
*  I'm just keeping it real. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1019.36s)]
*  I don't want to give them anything. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1020.64s)]
*  They don't deserve it, okay? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1022.36s)]
*  But go ahead, tell me why you think [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1024.08s)]
*  it makes sense to be [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1025.56s)]
*  a registered Democrat. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1026.4s)]
*  No, I don't think you're crazy, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1028.6s)]
*  is what I was going to say. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1030.44s)]
*  I get it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1031.92s)]
*  The majority of the country's [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1033.92s)]
*  independence now and those are the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1035.32s)]
*  people that we should be trying to [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1037.04s)]
*  win over, that makes sense. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1038.76s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1040.16s)]
*  I'm staying because I want to [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1041.3200000000002s)]
*  rebuild the Democratic Party back [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1042.88s)]
*  to what it was under FDR and [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1044.88s)]
*  take it in the right direction. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1046.24s)]
*  because we need one of the major [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1047.96s)]
*  parties to go in the right [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1049.16s)]
*  direction. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  And the Republicans, we know what [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1050.88s)]
*  their answer is, perpetual tax [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1052.3200000000002s)]
*  cuts for the rich. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1053.8400000000001s)]
*  That's the only answer they have [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvD9lAvjtJI&t=1055.0800000000002s)]
