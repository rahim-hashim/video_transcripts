# Dave Portnoy EXPLODES Over 'Jew Jokes'
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o)

*  Don't tell me to shut up. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=7.44s)]
*  Shut the up you bald. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=11.52s)]
*  How's that? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=12.64s)]
*  It's kill. I'll never recover from that Dave. Go ahead, continue. I'll never recover. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=13.52s)]
*  Well, you're the one who like, big boss man. Don't tell. I'll tell you work for me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=17.12s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=20.64s)]
*  You little bitch. You work for me. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=21.52s)]
*  Sure, you bet. For now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=23.12s)]
*  You don't? For now? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Quit. I don't care. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=25.92s)]
*  Well, is this show or not a show? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=26.64s)]
*  Like is this show or not a show? Like we can't have a conversation? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=29.12s)]
*  You're an idiot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Okay, continue. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=33.2s)]
*  You're literally saying people should be allowed to make [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=33.68s)]
*  true jokes say whatever they want right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=36.4s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=38.64s)]
*  Yes, I think people should be allowed to make jokes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=38.96s)]
*  So how many motherfuckers- [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=40.8s)]
*  Yes, jokes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=42.8s)]
*  Jews have to be killed before you stop. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=42.88s)]
*  Barstool sports founder Dave Portnoy made headlines for condemning jokes about Jewish [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=48.8s)]
*  people during an explosive debate with his fellow host. Before we get into the details, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=54.4s)]
*  Cenk, what are your initial reactions to that clip? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=60.96s)]
*  So I defend Dave Portnoy. Of course, I think any reasonable person would have when [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=65.12s)]
*  somebody wrote F to Jews in his bar, right? And he went nuts over and he should go nuts over. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=69.52s)]
*  He's totally lost me here. So I'm going to explain all the reasons why he's lost me, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=76.0s)]
*  especially the hypocrisy a little bit later in this segment. But I do have one question for him [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=79.92s)]
*  for now. How many Palestinians have to be killed before we're not allowed to say something [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=85.12s)]
*  derogatory towards Palestinians, Arabs or Muslims? A billion? Interesting. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=90.56s)]
*  Fascinating double standards. Jordan. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  Yep, seeing it more and more, but let's get into the details. What sparked this whole fight was [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=101.68s)]
*  an argument that Kirk Minahane and Dave had the previous day about Kirk's co-host on a different [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=107.68s)]
*  podcast, a guy named Mick. Portnoy has accused Mick of being an anti-Semitic POS because of a post [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=114.48s)]
*  he wrote after students ordered a sign saying F the Jews at the Barstool bar in Philly. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=121.84s)]
*  It read, Rabbi Dave, who said multiple racial slurs on camera, is now ruining people's lives [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  for saying F the Jews. It's his club, so ultimately he can employ whoever he wants, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=136.08s)]
*  but he's in no place to lecture people on what's okay to say. Get the blank out of here with that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=143.12s)]
*  Minahane suggested that they have Mick on the podcast to have a conversation, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  but Dave shot it down saying he's just a troll who wants a platform. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=155.68s)]
*  And that's when the conversation turned to a broader debate about whether it's okay to make [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  any jokes about Jewish people right now. Take a look. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=163.84s)]
*  Can you see the difference? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  My point is, they're words, they're words, they're words. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=171.76s)]
*  They are words, they are words. No, honestly, a guy on Twitter tweeting- [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=172.4s)]
*  When does freedom of speech become- [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=176.56s)]
*  A guy tweeting at you, you asked me the question. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=180.16s)]
*  When does freedom of speech impose on freedom of religion? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  I find it to be harmless. Some guy tweeted you, Rabbi Portnoy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=185.76s)]
*  When does freedom of speech impose on freedom of religion? How many people have to get murdered? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=188.08s)]
*  You're acting like right now people making Jew jokes is just the same as 15 years ago. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  No, but my thing is when you tell people, stop making jokes, stop doing this, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=199.12s)]
*  what does that accomplish? That's not the core of the issue. It's not Mick or some other guy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=202.56s)]
*  tweeting that you're a Jew. That's not the core issue here. That's not why somebody's going- [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  It's all related. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=212.4s)]
*  Then we should just stop making jokes about anything and then nothing will happen. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=213.84s)]
*  Stop making rape jokes. Stop making jokes about this. Stop making jokes about Catholicism, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=217.36s)]
*  about priests raping kids, which is what people made during that scandal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=221.44s)]
*  When do you stop doing it and when do you do it? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=225.04s)]
*  I think right now you probably- [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=227.28s)]
*  Okay, nothing. Silence everything. Every comedian, don't tell a joke about it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=229.6s)]
*  That's how the world works. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=236.16s)]
*  So now what do we do? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  Maybe you stop with the Jew jokes and act like it's not a big deal when someone does [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=238.72s)]
*  the Jews in a bar. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=243.52s)]
*  Ultimately, they landed on somewhat of an agreement when it comes to making jokes versus [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=244.48s)]
*  open anti-Semitism. Take a look. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=252.16s)]
*  I think it's different when you're saying they should stop telling jokes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=255.2s)]
*  I don't see how that stops the current issue. If you told me that, stop the current issue, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=258.8s)]
*  I'd be like, all right, I don't think that's going to stop these psychopaths. I would be going to be [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=265.92s)]
*  like, wow, a comedian told a joke. Let's get going here, guys. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=269.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't think, but I think basically the same way the sign got posted, the same way [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=272.72s)]
*  people are free to basically just be like Jews or Jews belong in ovens or I wish that the Holocaust [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=280.32000000000005s)]
*  survivor at least we got her the second time. Those are jokes, fine, but the comfortability [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  of people just with open anti-Semitism emboldens these lunatics to go act on what they're doing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=292.72s)]
*  Had it ended there, some people might have seen that as a reasonable and understandable conclusion. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=303.36s)]
*  But literally, minutes later, after proclaiming the right, that right now, nobody should be making [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  jokes about Jews because of violence against them. He made, I guess, a joke, if you want to call it [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=314.48s)]
*  that, about Greta Thunberg being killed. Take a look. You should just go over to Gaza. We can [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  do unnamed. You can be live in Gaza. I'll jump on Greta Van Thorsten or whatever that girl, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  she's sailing there. Whoever that, I hope they hit a missile on her boat. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=331.28s)]
*  Well, I hope they hit a missile. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=336.88s)]
*  On the boat? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  I hate when I hit a missile on a boat. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=340.32s)]
*  Knock that boat down, Greta, whatever her name is. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  Thunberg, I believe, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=343.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  Missile, starboard side. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay, so it's okay there. On top of that, in the wake of this debate, a clip began to resurface of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  him defending a joke about rape, which has also gone viral. The clip in question came from a 2012 [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=357.6s)]
*  story from Inside Edition about bar stools touring, quote, blackout parties that were hosted in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=365.04s)]
*  college towns across the US. Portnoy was confronted by interviewer Lisa Guerrero for joking that the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  women at these parties, quote, deserved to be raped. You can see the transcript here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  You posted the following on your site. I never condone rape, but if you're a size six and you're [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=383.36s)]
*  wearing skinny jeans, you kind of deserve to be raped. Portnoy, correct, I stand by that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=387.68s)]
*  I think it's a funny joke. Guerrero, you think rape is funny? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=393.44000000000005s)]
*  Portnoy, no, I didn't say that. I think it's a funny joke. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=398.16s)]
*  Guerrero, do you understand how offensive that is? Portnoy, no, I obviously don't. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=402.48s)]
*  Cenk, what do you make of this? You were saying you kind of disagree with them and you're upset [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=409.6s)]
*  about the hypocrisy with the Thunberg statement. Could you elaborate? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, let's break it down one by one. So there is no defense of F to Jews. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  It's not a joke. There was a punchline, right? So Portnoy is 100% right about that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  And then Camp Manahani says, hey, let's get this guy who said F to Jews on the show. Why? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  How does that help? Look, I'm not saying arrest him. I'm not saying, well, I mean, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=440.32s)]
*  he's, I would fire him for sure, right? I wouldn't necessarily chase him around the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=445.84s)]
*  earth for the rest of my life, but in terms of canceling him or whatever. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=451.12s)]
*  But I don't wanna work with a guy who thinks F to Jews. And I don't think that it's gonna be [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=454.4s)]
*  a helpful conversation on the show. It's not to cancel him. It's just, and I thought like [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=459.76s)]
*  Megyn Kelly, which the blackface comment should have had a conversation with Al Roker who was [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  really mad about it on NBC. Overall, I agree with conversations, but some people are so toxic [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=468.24s)]
*  that it becomes a counterproductive conversation. And so I think that would have been one of them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=472.96s)]
*  I think Portnoy makes sense in saying, no, I don't want that on my air. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=477.68s)]
*  On jokes, no, Portnoy loses me totally. So Manahani is right about that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=481.84s)]
*  But not every joke is necessarily funny or appropriate. You can't just say like, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=488.08s)]
*  I'm making a joke. Again, F to Muslims and they should all be killed. Well, where's the punchline? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=493.68s)]
*  So you can't just use a joke as cover for saying dirtbag things, right? But if it's an actual joke, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=504.24s)]
*  then I think certainly a lot of Portnoy's audience, certainly the right wing, etc. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=512.48s)]
*  And I would say, we pull these jokes way too much. But it's actually gotta be a joke, right? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=517.36s)]
*  Then you get to the hypocrisy and then it becomes a no-brainer. No, Portnoy's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=524.72s)]
*  record on that is terrible. And he did it on that show. And guys, this is the thing. I mean, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=529.52s)]
*  it's true of a lot of people, not just the right wing. But I point out how often it applies to the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=536.48s)]
*  right wing. Where they're like, if it's about me, then not funny. If it's about you, hilarious, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=543.44s)]
*  right? You're offended, I couldn't care less. I'm offended, that's a huge deal. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=550.96s)]
*  So Dave Portnoy is Jewish, so he says, if it's a Jewish joke, I'm super offended, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=557.84s)]
*  and you should not be able to do it. A joke about killing someone who's trying to help [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=563.0400000000001s)]
*  the Palestinians go to Tonberg. That's so funny, or maybe real. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=568.32s)]
*  I don't know that that's much of a joke, to Jordan's point. But even if you were gonna give it to him, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=577.12s)]
*  well, okay, so it's okay to kill whatever religion Tonberg is. It's okay to make that joke. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  It's okay to make a joke about how these people were trying to desperately help [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=588.6400000000001s)]
*  starving and dying Palestinians should get murdered. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=592.88s)]
*  Nah, that doesn't make any sense. He's not even trying to be principled. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=596.96s)]
*  And then of course the rape joke. Again, guys, I'm in favor of just letting jokes [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  slide and we over-police it, etc. But you can't say, yeah, I made your rape joke. So, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=607.52s)]
*  you made a joke about Jewish people, well, I'm Jewish. No way, that's unacceptable. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=613.2s)]
*  Now, come on, the hypocrisy's through the roof, it's not even close. What do you think, Jordan? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=616.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's clearly not a joke. What I think is interesting is he is becoming what he has [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=621.28s)]
*  long hated, which is the overly sensitive like SJW, like woke liberal, who's too sensitive about [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=631.76s)]
*  everything, can't take a joke, lighten up. You heard Republicans and conservatives complain [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=640.0s)]
*  about this for years and that's what they're becoming. And I'm with you. What those kids did [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=644.56s)]
*  in the bar, that's not a joke. Whatever else he's mad about, I don't think those specifically [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=650.64s)]
*  are jokes. I think the classification and being around comedy is wrong. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=658.24s)]
*  I think what we saw, especially in that bar, is just open anti-Semitism. The kid tried to use the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  joke defense because it's worked for a lot of conservatives for years. And people like Dave [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=667.8399999999999s)]
*  Portnoy have used that defense for things that weren't jokes. So, lighten up, I said something [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=673.12s)]
*  really offensive and heinous and deliberately malicious. It's just a joke. And I think they're [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=677.84s)]
*  just so conditioned to using that and getting away with it. But now that it impacts him directly, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=682.48s)]
*  now that it impacts his community, now that he's on the receiving end of it, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=686.72s)]
*  no, it's not gonna fly. Certainly not to condone what those kids did, but you're seeing how, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=691.2800000000001s)]
*  just as we've seen time and time again with conservatives, there is no principle. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=697.0400000000001s)]
*  It's, I believe this until it affects me directly. I'm against marriage equality until somebody in my [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=701.6s)]
*  family comes out. I am against any sort of sensible gun regulation until somebody I know [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=707.52s)]
*  gets shot. Time and time again, you see this behavior. It would be better if we all just [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=712.8s)]
*  took a step back, calm down, and approach these types of issues with rationale, logic, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=717.84s)]
*  some sort of collective understanding that we're all trying to sort through these problems together, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=724.56s)]
*  finding some common ground. And I don't think Dave Portnoy is certainly going to lead on that front, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  but it is of all people to get upset about offensive comments. That is what he built his [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=734.64s)]
*  entire media empire on. He has no leg to stand on. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=740.8s)]
*  Yeah, and last thing for me is go back to the beginning. So, okay, a couple of heinous crimes [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=744.96s)]
*  happened against Jewish people in this country recently. So you have the two Israeli staffers [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=752.0s)]
*  who were killed in Washington, and then you had that horrible flamethrower attack where eight were [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=757.92s)]
*  badly injured in Boulder, Colorado. So hey, it's a raw and tough time for Jews in America. That's [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=763.2s)]
*  true, right? Two things can be true at the same time. At the same time, there's 54,000 Palestinians [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=769.5200000000001s)]
*  who have been killed. There's 30,000 women and children who have been killed in Gaza. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=779.0400000000001s)]
*  And so it's one thing to say, hey, this is a rough time, so be extra sensitive to this group. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=785.5200000000001s)]
*  But the other group, don't be sensitive to them at all, who cares? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=792.48s)]
*  We slaughtered 30,000 other women and children. No, no, I don't care. I mean, forget jokes. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  I just don't care. And in fact, if you're going to help them, maybe you should be murdered by an IDF [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=803.2s)]
*  missile. Yeah, it doesn't seem like you're overly sensitive to actually offending people at a [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=807.76s)]
*  sensitive time. You're just sensitive to your group being offended. Well, that's where you lose [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=816.72s)]
*  the moral high ground. You had the moral high ground. We covered it on the show before. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=824.0s)]
*  Gay Portnoy, a lot of credit. I now take it back, okay? Because this is not a moral high ground. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=828.32s)]
*  This is just selfishness and total lack of principle. Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=833.52s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SiIsxNcI-o&t=838.24s)]
