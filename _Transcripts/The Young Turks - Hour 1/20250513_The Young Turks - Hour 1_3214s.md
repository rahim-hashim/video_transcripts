# Trump Accepts $400MIL PLANE From Qatar. Trump FEUDING W/ Netanyahu? - May 12, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8)
*  All right, welcome to Young Turks, Cenk Uygur and Xperian with you guys. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=0.0s)]
*  Good to have the both of us back here in the studio. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=5.64s)]
*  Great to see you, Casper. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=8.88s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=9.88s)]
*  So we got a wild show for you guys today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=12.02s)]
*  Trump has done the good, the bad and the ugly. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=14.8s)]
*  And we'll tell you about a couple of his tricks and why some of the proposals that look good [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=17.6s)]
*  might not be as good as they look. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=22.64s)]
*  But on the other hand, he seems to be separating himself from Israel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=25.48s)]
*  That is super interesting and relates to several stories in the rundown today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=34.04s)]
*  All right, with that being said, let's get started there. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=38.52s)]
*  Well, the big kahuna in the news today, of course, is the trade deal that President Trump [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=41.2s)]
*  made with China. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=45.92s)]
*  Is it a good trade deal? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=47.64s)]
*  Will it prevent the inflation that many are worried about? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=49.16s)]
*  Well, let's get to the details. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=53.0s)]
*  Yesterday we achieved a total reset with China after productive talks in Geneva. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=55.8s)]
*  Both sides now agreed to reduce the tariffs imposed after April 2nd to 10% for 90 days [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  as negotiators continue in the largest structural issues. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=70.88s)]
*  The United States and China have reached a temporary deal that mutually lowers tariffs [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=74.68s)]
*  with Trump describing this deal as a total reset. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=82.08s)]
*  Now I should note that if it is considered a reset, it's only a temporary 90 day reset. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  But before I get to the details on what the trade negotiation entails, what do you think, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Cenk, reset? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=99.12s)]
*  No, so it's a positive step because the 145% was mental. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=100.12s)]
*  But it's not that great. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=106.72s)]
*  So I think it's gonna have a whole host of issues, but maybe I'm wrong, because the stock [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  market disagrees with me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=113.68s)]
*  They're super excited. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=115.0s)]
*  They think everything's on the door, but we're gonna tell you about a couple things here [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=116.0s)]
*  and make you realize this is still gonna cause huge problems and it is not what it appears [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=119.64s)]
*  to be. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=125.36s)]
*  So things aren't going back to what they were prior to the announcement that Trump made [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=126.36s)]
*  on Liberation Day. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=131.44s)]
*  It's important to remember that because the United States is still maintaining its 10% [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=132.52s)]
*  universal tariff on all foreign imports into the United States. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=137.76s)]
*  And yes, that also impacts China, of course. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=142.44s)]
*  So the Trump administration has repeatedly stated that this number is the absolute lowest [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=145.32s)]
*  any country will be able to negotiate in regard to their products being imported to the US. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  Now the US also insists that China is still not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=158.12s)]
*  into the United States and is keeping, and as a result, Trump has decided to keep the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=165.92s)]
*  additional 20% tariff on Chinese goods as a consequence of that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=170.88s)]
*  So as you can see, you got the 10% tariff, the baseline. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=175.56s)]
*  In addition to that, you have the additional 20% tariff in regard to fentanyl. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  However, the Trump administration has indicated that China is starting to negotiate in good [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=184.68s)]
*  faith. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  So that signals that things are moving in a more positive direction. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  So here's Treasury Secretary Scott Besant with more. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=195.48s)]
*  We saw here in Geneva that the Chinese are now serious about assisting the US in stopping [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=199.76s)]
*  the flow of precursor drugs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  Because the Chinese brought their trade delegation, they led by the vice premier, but they also [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  brought a deputy minister for security who was their fentanyl expert. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=217.3s)]
*  We brought someone from our national security staff, and they had a very long and in-depth [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  sidebar about how our two countries could work together. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=233.56s)]
*  So obviously there you have Besant addressing the issue with the flow of fentanyl into the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=239.9s)]
*  United States. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=244.34s)]
*  The first thing that I'll add before I go to you, Cenk, is the fact that the Trump [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=245.34s)]
*  administration's tariffs on specific sectors or specific products like cars and steel will [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=248.9s)]
*  remain in place and they do in fact apply to Chinese imports. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  So there's still going to be steep tariffs. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=261.88s)]
*  But this thing that Trump does is really fascinating where he'll kind of come out of the gate with [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=264.5s)]
*  like a crazy number. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=269.18s)]
*  Everyone panics about that number. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=271.58s)]
*  And then through his negotiations, the tariffs are lowered, but they're still high, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  They just seem lower relative to what he had initially proposed. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=279.9s)]
*  Yeah, so there's two problems here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=283.97999999999996s)]
*  And first one is, did we really get anything out of this? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=287.5s)]
*  Or was this just the surrender that was dressed up like it was a peace treaty and a negotiation [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=291.29999999999995s)]
*  and a compromise? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=298.18s)]
*  Because I've read a bunch of things, I haven't seen anyone explain to us what China gave [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=299.62s)]
*  to us. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=305.9s)]
*  They still have a 10% tariff on us across the board. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=306.9s)]
*  So they took back the 115% on top because we had moved it to 125, so they moved it to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=310.62s)]
*  125. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=316.86s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=317.86s)]
*  Okay, but that didn't solve anything from before Trump made the threats and put on the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=318.86s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=324.42s)]
*  So that leads to the second problem, which is Trump loves to create a mess. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=325.42s)]
*  And then when he halfway resolves it, takes credit for resolving the mess. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=328.86s)]
*  But brother, this mess didn't exist before you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=332.98s)]
*  The mess that existed before you was on China, especially other countries as well, but especially [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=335.14s)]
*  China, putting tariffs on us and having unfair trade practices. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=341.26s)]
*  But none of that got resolved. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=348.24s)]
*  So where's the win? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=350.62s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out where the win is. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=352.14s)]
*  And by the way, the prices are about to keep increasing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=354.32s)]
*  You're gonna wonder why, I'll get back to that in a second. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=357.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=360.7s)]
*  Well, to that point, Cenk, the Trump administration is currently alleging that China will ease [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=361.7s)]
*  its non-tariff barriers. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=367.5s)]
*  But they haven't provided details on A, what that means and what that would look like. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=370.62s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=376.22s)]
*  There might be more details coming out in regard to that in future reporting. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=377.22s)]
*  But for now, we don't really know what that means. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=380.92s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  According to the current reporting, it doesn't really seem like the US has really gotten [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=385.06s)]
*  much out of China here, other than the fact that China has lowered its tariffs in response [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=388.38s)]
*  to Trump's threats of increasing tariffs on Chinese goods. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=393.14s)]
*  But again, I wanna be clear, not the original tariffs they had. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=396.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=399.38s)]
*  The extra tariffs they put in because of the extra tariffs Trump put in. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=400.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=403.06s)]
*  So we have gained nothing from this so far, this gambit of putting 145% tariff on China. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=404.06s)]
*  Now in retaliation to Trump's announcement on Liberation Day, China decided to stop exporting [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=409.42s)]
*  rare earth minerals to the United States. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=416.34000000000003s)]
*  At the moment, China has paused those exports of rare earth minerals to the US, but that [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=419.18s)]
*  could resume thanks to this deal. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=424.32s)]
*  But again, going back to the point that Cenk just made, the stopping of this trade was [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=426.94s)]
*  in response to Trump's announcement on Liberation Day. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=434.70000000000005s)]
*  So that was China essentially retaliating against the Trump administration. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=437.58s)]
*  So both the US and China were set to face economic hardship due to these tariffs, make [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=441.38s)]
*  no mistake about that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=446.41999999999996s)]
*  In fact, just last Friday, Reuters had reported that Chinese officials have grown increasingly [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=447.82s)]
*  alarmed about tariffs impact on the economy and the risk of isolation as China's trading [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=452.36s)]
*  partners have started negotiating deals with Washington. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=457.34s)]
*  According to three officials familiar with Beijing's thinking, among the main drivers [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=461.82s)]
*  of Beijing's climb down were internal signals that Chinese companies were struggling to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=466.38s)]
*  avoid bankruptcies and to replace the US market. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=471.18s)]
*  Three people familiar with the Chinese government's thinking said some areas feeling immediate [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=475.3s)]
*  impact were furniture and toy makers, as well as textiles, said one of the officials. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=480.3s)]
*  And according to Reuters or sources who spoke to Reuters, the Chinese government also feared [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=486.52s)]
*  that its trading partners would essentially start negotiating new agreements with the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=492.78000000000003s)]
*  US while leaving China behind. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=497.42s)]
*  And so in regard to the feel of the more recent negotiations and how the Trump administration [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=499.62s)]
*  believes that China is negotiating in good faith, it's likely because these tariffs weren't [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=506.2s)]
*  just gonna crush the American economy, they're also gonna crush China's economy as well. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=510.98s)]
*  So what happens after the 90 days are up, because remember, this is temporary, this [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=516.02s)]
*  is only gonna be in place for 90 days. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=520.62s)]
*  Trump has stated that if negotiations with China fall through, then his administration [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=522.86s)]
*  would just raise tariffs back to the insanely high figure that he has lowered from in recent [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=526.7s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=534.7s)]
*  So that's where the negotiations currently stand, Jay. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=536.02s)]
*  So I'm gonna tell you about the two things that are gonna happen next and not gonna happen. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=545.86s)]
*  But first, Blanks is a member on YouTube and wrote in China blinked. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=555.1s)]
*  Brother, I don't, yes and no, let's put it this way. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=559.58s)]
*  I think Anna's right that China blinked in the sense of they had these companies that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=562.54s)]
*  were gonna go under and they went and made a deal with America. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=569.5s)]
*  They didn't give up anything, so it's not like they really blinked in that sense, other [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=573.0999999999999s)]
*  than the new stuff as we've explained a couple times. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=577.6199999999999s)]
*  But I think we blinked a lot more, we got nothing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=581.26s)]
*  They still have the old tariffs that they had and the reason Trump blinked is because [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=585.6199999999999s)]
*  we were about to have empty shelves. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=592.8199999999999s)]
*  We started to have some empty shelves, the shipping stopped, we're gonna have supply [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=594.3399999999999s)]
*  chain issues. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=597.9399999999999s)]
*  Because when you add 145% on top of anything, it's totally unsellable, so they don't bother [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=599.54s)]
*  shipping it, right? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=604.18s)]
*  There is nobody has 150% profit margin and they think, no big deal on your 145% you've [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=605.6999999999999s)]
*  added on top. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=611.66s)]
*  I'll make an extra, that's not a thing that exists. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=612.66s)]
*  So he avoided that colossal mess of his own making that was in the middle of happening, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=615.4599999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=620.98s)]
*  Now, the part where I would say China blinked only a little bit is because they had a so [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=621.98s)]
*  badly cornered. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  That if China went to European Union and some of the other allies we have and circle the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=627.94s)]
*  wagons against us, then we would have been in monumental trouble and they could definitely [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=633.74s)]
*  outlast us. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=639.4200000000001s)]
*  But they chose not to do that and my guess is because of those very influential, very [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=641.0s)]
*  wealthy businessmen in China who were like, yeah, yeah, yeah, the Chinese government can [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=646.22s)]
*  withstand this. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=650.6600000000001s)]
*  The Chinese people can withstand this, but our bank accounts can't. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=651.7s)]
*  So they have corruption over there as well that affects us. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=655.82s)]
*  But now finally, the most important part, so we still have a 30% tariff on them, right? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=658.74s)]
*  Because of the 20% extra for fentanyl. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=663.74s)]
*  It's nonsensical China will say, yeah, we are gonna stop that and we'll choose to believe [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=666.08s)]
*  them and take that 20% off. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=671.9000000000001s)]
*  I guarantee it, there's no question about it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=673.58s)]
*  He's definitely gonna take that 20% off. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=676.5400000000001s)]
*  It's only a matter of time, right? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=678.6400000000001s)]
*  But in the meanwhile, it's still 30%. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=681.22s)]
*  30% still super high. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=683.4200000000001s)]
*  It's not like, it's lower than 145%. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=686.5400000000001s)]
*  So I bet prices going up by at least 30% is not going to be a big deal. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=689.82s)]
*  No, it's gonna be a big deal. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=694.94s)]
*  And so when the prices continue to rise, even after this big spectacle about, we have a [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=697.1600000000001s)]
*  deal and China did what we wanted, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=703.0600000000001s)]
*  And the stock market totally bought into it, went up a lot today. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=706.82s)]
*  It's past Liberation Day. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=709.86s)]
*  Where was the day before Liberation Day when the market collapsed because of the proposed [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=711.62s)]
*  tariffs? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=716.1s)]
*  It's now high, which I think is nuts. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=717.1s)]
*  But hey, maybe they know better than I do. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=718.82s)]
*  And maybe people is like, 30% extra on prices skyrocketing, no big deal. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=720.7s)]
*  But I don't think so. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=726.36s)]
*  And I think Trump is a lot more backing down to do, because these tariffs are never gonna [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=727.36s)]
*  work in a structured this way. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=730.94s)]
*  Yeah, just to get a little more specific. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=733.0200000000001s)]
*  Today the Dow Jones jumped over 1,100 points or almost 3%. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=735.3800000000001s)]
*  The S&P 500 went up 3.26% and the NASDAQ went up 4.35%. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=741.86s)]
*  So today was the best day since April 9th for all three indexes. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=747.7s)]
*  But there is still a lot of concern about prices going up for items that are being imported [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=753.1400000000001s)]
*  from China. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=759.5400000000001s)]
*  And also, I personally am fearful that companies that are not going or products that aren't [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=761.22s)]
*  going to be impacted by Trump's tariffs are going to also be inflated in price because [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=766.46s)]
*  that's always what happens. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=773.34s)]
*  I mean, you had supply chain disruptions during COVID. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=774.82s)]
*  So some products as a result of those disruptions ended up being in short supply. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=778.5s)]
*  Prices went up for those products. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=784.4s)]
*  But then other companies selling other items that weren't impacted by supply chain issues [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=785.62s)]
*  took advantage of that and increased their prices also. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=790.5400000000001s)]
*  And I'm just gonna leave you with a quote from Gene Soroka. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=793.7s)]
*  He is the executive director for the Port of Los Angeles. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=797.08s)]
*  And he says even at 30%, a 30% tariff with a 90 day reprieve, it's not going to dramatically [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=801.26s)]
*  change what we're seeing right now. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=807.82s)]
*  So Soroka said companies that supply critical goods like healthcare products and that sell [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=810.1s)]
*  merchandise time to the holiday season such as toys might use this moment to restock. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=815.22s)]
*  But your refrigerator, outdoor patio set, regular stuff is not just going to come and [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=821.22s)]
*  flood the marketplace because we've gone from 145 to 30%, he said. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=826.3s)]
*  And in fact, Jay Foreman, who serves as the CEO of a toy company called Basic Fun, expects [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=832.66s)]
*  prices to go up for toys to the tune of 10 to 15%. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=838.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so my last thoughts here are, here's another problem you layer on top of what Anna [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=843.98s)]
*  just said, which is that once they raise the prices as we saw with the supply chain issues, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=850.38s)]
*  they never bring them back down. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=855.7s)]
*  So that makes the inflation permanent. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=857.7800000000001s)]
*  Once they get you to buy something at a certain price, they're like, there's no company that's [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=859.9000000000001s)]
*  gonna bring it back down. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=864.5400000000001s)]
*  So that means all the companies in those industries, toys, refrigerators, etc., they're all gonna [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=866.3000000000001s)]
*  have to raise their prices, probably by about 30%, right? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=872.56s)]
*  And then after they do, even if the tariffs go away, since they all raise them together, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=876.56s)]
*  there's no competitive need to bring them back down. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=882.0s)]
*  So they'll just keep them higher. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=885.4s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=886.6s)]
*  And then that inflation will last for a long, long time until they screw us. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=887.6s)]
*  And last thing is, I know I asked for principals and for people not to be hypocritical on both [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=891.48s)]
*  sides and I know that there's no chance it's gonna happen. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=896.16s)]
*  But in this case, so which one is it, guys? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=898.92s)]
*  The ones that supported Trump's maniacal tariffs. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=901.4s)]
*  So was it that they're gonna last forever and they're gonna rebuild manufacturing? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=904.84s)]
*  Or it's the art of the deal. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=909.04s)]
*  Okay, I'm okay with you picking one. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=910.4s)]
*  I'm not sure that you even really believe the one you're picking. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=912.16s)]
*  But you gotta pick one. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=915.3199999999999s)]
*  You can't say they were gonna last forever and they were gonna rebuild manufacturing [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=916.86s)]
*  when they just didn't last forever. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=920.24s)]
*  He just took them away. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=921.68s)]
*  And he's gonna keep on taking them away. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=922.68s)]
*  So- [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=924.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, my read of this is that it's actually a mix of both. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=925.88s)]
*  I think that there are targeted tariffs on specific industries that Trump is serious [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=929.72s)]
*  about. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=934.48s)]
*  So for instance, he's keeping the tariffs on steel, steel imports specifically. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=935.48s)]
*  And so I think that's the right way to do tariffs. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=939.64s)]
*  Doing these weird, wide ranging tariffs on all imports when it doesn't necessarily make [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=942.9399999999999s)]
*  sense for American consumers is ridiculous. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=949.0s)]
*  So I think when it comes to those broad, wide ranging tariffs on other countries, it's [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=952.5s)]
*  a way to scare those countries and bring them to the negotiating table. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=959.94s)]
*  So but Anna, you and I have been saying that from day one, that you could do targeted industry [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=964.82s)]
*  specific tariffs. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=969.58s)]
*  And that's actually a progressive position. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=970.58s)]
*  But that's not what Trump supporters were saying. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=975.02s)]
*  They were saying the global nuclear tariffs were a genius idea and they were gonna work [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=977.82s)]
*  and they were gonna magically rebuild manufacturing. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=982.78s)]
*  It takes 10 years to rebuild an industry. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=985.26s)]
*  So it takes a minimum three, four years to build a factory, right, before you even get [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=988.9399999999999s)]
*  there. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=993.9799999999999s)]
*  So I'm just pointing out for you guys. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=994.9799999999999s)]
*  But if at the end he gets to a position we like, which is, hey, he's keeping it on steel [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=997.3199999999999s)]
*  and a couple other industries, he negotiated some deals, I'll take a win, right? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1002.02s)]
*  But please don't buy into everything a politician says. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1008.4599999999999s)]
*  So when he said he was gonna magically rebuild manufacturing, come on guys, obviously that [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1012.14s)]
*  wasn't the case. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1016.18s)]
*  When I said that, and it's not like people didn't say that, they did. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1017.42s)]
*  I had a debate on Piers Morgan with Kerry Lake and Batyong Sargon. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1020.14s)]
*  And they both said, no way, those tariffs are gonna be in place forever. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1024.7s)]
*  And then we were gonna come back in four months and that they were gonna still brag about [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1028.54s)]
*  how they were in place. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1032.32s)]
*  I think it was four days later, most of them were gone. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1033.32s)]
*  So just listen to what people are saying and judge you. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1037.18s)]
*  Use your own judgment for what you want out of this, right? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1041.5s)]
*  No matter where the partisans lie and keep an open mind and independent judgment. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1044.46s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1048.8200000000002s)]
*  But when we come back, we have a massive Gaza segment waiting for you. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1050.38s)]
*  Don't miss it. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1054.54s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1055.54s)]

*  We've got a big update on Gaza, so let's get into it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1095.5s)]
*  The conditions in Gaza is getting more catastrophic than before. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1099.8999999999999s)]
*  We are now seeing the children are starving. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1105.4599999999998s)]
*  That man that you just heard say that Gazans need to be starved is actually an Israeli [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1125.34s)]
*  Knesset member by the name of Moshe Sada. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1135.34s)]
*  Admitting again on Israeli television that starvation isn't just a side effect of this [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1138.34s)]
*  war on Gaza. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1145.22s)]
*  It's part of the goal, it's part of the Israeli government and the IDF's strategy. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1146.86s)]
*  And sadly, he is far from the only member of the Israeli parliament who sees starvation [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1151.54s)]
*  as a tool for punishing and driving civilians out of Gaza, which of course is considered [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1157.86s)]
*  a war crime. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1165.76s)]
*  It violates international laws. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1166.76s)]
*  Now the Israeli blockade of Gaza is now in its third month, and I mean blockade of humanitarian [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1169.1s)]
*  aid entering the Gaza Strip. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1175.22s)]
*  This began in early March, no food, water or medication has been allowed into the territory, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1177.9s)]
*  Cenk. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1184.9s)]
*  Yeah, so that guy you just saw is a bona fide fascist, and he is very similar to the Nazis. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1185.9s)]
*  So I hope I'm being clear enough with what some members of the Israeli government are [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1192.98s)]
*  up to. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1197.02s)]
*  Don't tell me that you're offended by that if you support a guy who says let's starve [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1199.26s)]
*  children to death. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1203.1000000000001s)]
*  That is Nazi 101. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1204.64s)]
*  So and if you say no, it's okay, because they're not Israeli children, so we can starve them [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1207.34s)]
*  to death, their lives don't count. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1213.02s)]
*  That's Nazi 101, okay? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1215.02s)]
*  And I wish he was alone and I wish he was a lone madman in the Israeli government and [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1219.4599999999998s)]
*  we could give you the context and say, don't worry. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1224.1s)]
*  It's not like the Israeli government actually voted to do that policy. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1227.1s)]
*  But we can't tell you that because Israeli government did vote to do that policy. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1231.3799999999999s)]
*  And there are tons of voices, as Ana's about to explain to you, inside the Israeli government, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1235.6599999999999s)]
*  literally saying, yeah, of course we should starve their children to death. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1240.54s)]
*  And in fact, and this is the most amazing part of the story, they think that it is immoral [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1244.9399999999998s)]
*  not to starve the children. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1250.02s)]
*  Yeah, do you remember in the beginning of the current war on Gaza, there was that big [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1251.6599999999999s)]
*  debate about whether the IDF had bombed a hospital? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1257.1799999999998s)]
*  And they're like, my God. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1260.62s)]
*  We would never do that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1262.8999999999999s)]
*  The IDF is a moral army. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1264.14s)]
*  We would never bomb a hospital. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1266.3400000000001s)]
*  Every hospital in Gaza is obliterated. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1267.74s)]
*  And now they are actively saying out loud in public and in internal debates about how [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1272.3400000000001s)]
*  they would like to murder Palestinian children. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1277.8600000000001s)]
*  With our money. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1280.46s)]
*  Yeah, and of course they won't ever do it with their own money. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1281.46s)]
*  They need our money to not give the Palestinians food. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1283.94s)]
*  Okay, so now if you're still defending this particular Israeli government, you really [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1287.74s)]
*  really need to go and clarify your morality, because you don't have any. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1293.9s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1298.82s)]
*  There is no excuse for this at all, at all. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1300.42s)]
*  But again, the bias is so deep that those Knesset members and cabinet members, they [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1304.22s)]
*  really believe that it's immoral not to murder these people. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1309.98s)]
*  I mean, it is a case study in dehumanization. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1313.1s)]
*  It is. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1316.22s)]
*  Because they have so effectively dehumanized Palestinians, including literal babies, literal [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1317.22s)]
*  children, that they loudly and proudly declare that they are intentionally starving them [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1322.18s)]
*  to death. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1328.02s)]
*  So let's get to those details. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1329.02s)]
*  Let's get to all the different Knesset members who have waited on this. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1330.02s)]
*  Now, Haaretz has reported that last week the Knesset held a first of its kind discussion [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1333.1000000000001s)]
*  on the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1339.66s)]
*  But I want to be clear, they weren't holding this hearing in order to do something to help [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1342.94s)]
*  Palestinians who are suffering as a result of this humanitarian crisis. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1348.5800000000002s)]
*  They're more worried about the public relations fallout from what the Israeli government and [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1352.8200000000002s)]
*  the IDF is doing. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1359.3400000000001s)]
*  They're worried about the PR, so that's why they're holding this hearing. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1360.3400000000001s)]
*  Now, during the meeting, Dr. Sharon Schall, who is from Natan, an Israeli-based organization [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1362.9s)]
*  that provides humanitarian aid around the world, remarked, quote, I think that even [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1370.3000000000002s)]
*  everyone sitting around this table doesn't want a suffering child to be unable to receive [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1375.1s)]
*  painkillers or minimal medical treatment. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1379.3799999999999s)]
*  And to her surprise, that actually ended up setting off a firestorm during this hearing. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1383.9s)]
*  Her assumption that nobody wanted Gaza children to starve apparently was incorrect. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1389.1s)]
*  So Israeli lawmaker, hold on, Israeli lawmaker Amit Halevi from Netanyahu's Likud party angrily [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1394.44s)]
*  interrupted her to say this, quote, I'm not sure you're speaking for us when you say we [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1402.02s)]
*  want to treat every child and every woman. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1408.46s)]
*  I hope you don't stand behind that statement either. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1411.66s)]
*  When fighting a group like this, the distinctions that exist in a normal world don't exist. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1415.06s)]
*  No, Amit, they do exist. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1421.3400000000001s)]
*  It's just that you're a monster. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1423.54s)]
*  Yep. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1425.02s)]
*  And you'd like to be like the Nazis and murder children. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1426.02s)]
*  And moral distinction exists for the rest of us who are not Nazis like you, okay? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1430.42s)]
*  And so, Saul- [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1437.98s)]
*  Look, hold on one second, I wanna be clear. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1438.98s)]
*  Dr. Sharon Shaw is the head of the medical sector at Natan Worldwide Disaster Relief. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1440.94s)]
*  And she's a wonderful person. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1445.3400000000001s)]
*  She's an Israeli, and she's saying, can we please get them medical attention? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1447.3400000000001s)]
*  Cuz I would hope none of us would be for children starving to death or not being able to deal [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1451.7s)]
*  with pain. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1457.98s)]
*  I'll give you a couple more details in a second for you. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1458.98s)]
*  So good person, the rest of them attacker. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1460.58s)]
*  They're like, how dare you? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1462.82s)]
*  It is immoral to not wanna cause these children pain. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1465.26s)]
*  Okay, well, monsters defined. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1469.02s)]
*  There is no excuse for it at all. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1472.8s)]
*  And if you're trying to make excuses for it, okay, and now we know what you would have [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1474.82s)]
*  done in the 1930s. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1480.14s)]
*  Yeah, look, Amit's thinking is barbaric thinking, okay? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1481.14s)]
*  The way a barbarian would think. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1486.18s)]
*  And so in the beginning of this war when Netanyahu tried to frame this situation as [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1488.26s)]
*  a war between civilization and barbarians. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1494.08s)]
*  Really you're gonna claim that you guys are the ones representing civilization, fighting [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1500.46s)]
*  against barbaric actions? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1505.68s)]
*  And what Hamas did on October 7th to be sure was barbaric. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1508.14s)]
*  So what does it say of the Israeli government when their response is a thousand times more [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1512.82s)]
*  barbaric? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1519.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1520.02s)]
*  Killed four more civilians than Hamas did on October 7th. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1521.02s)]
*  Imagine if Hamas said, well, of course we just starve all Israeli children to death. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1523.78s)]
*  They were occupying us, they deserved it and they were hiding behind the human shields [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  of Israeli babies. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1532.58s)]
*  So we starved them all to death. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1533.82s)]
*  We would all rightfully say they are the worst monsters in the world. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1535.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1538.82s)]
*  And Israeli government officials are saying it and saying it's immoral if you don't starve [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1539.82s)]
*  them. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1544.5s)]
*  So let's give you the horrific details of what these Nazis said. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1545.5s)]
*  So Schall responded to that statement by saying, I hope that you too don't want a four-year-old [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1549.1799999999998s)]
*  whose arm has been amputated to go without painkillers. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1556.62s)]
*  I hope you have that empathy too. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1560.58s)]
*  Even lawmaker Lamor Sunhar Malik decided to jump in. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1563.82s)]
*  This individual is from the Religious Zionism Party and they say that the only treatment [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1569.1399999999999s)]
*  needed here is for you. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1574.06s)]
*  So now threatening your own, threatening Israelis. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1577.62s)]
*  You dare to be a decent person, Dr. Sharon Schall? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1580.98s)]
*  You need treatment. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1583.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1584.8s)]
*  Yeah, there's something wrong with you. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1585.8s)]
*  Another participant remarked, my God, this is so sick. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1586.8s)]
*  You are the sickest doctor I've ever seen. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1590.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, how many Nazi doctors do you know? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1593.9799999999998s)]
*  Do you know Dr. Mengele and his descendants or something? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1596.9799999999998s)]
*  And I mean, do all the doctors you know think that you should starve children to death? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1600.9799999999998s)]
*  Jesus, what kind of Nazi doctor hospital are you familiar with? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1605.3s)]
*  Because guys, Haaretz is reporting this. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1610.26s)]
*  It's an Israeli paper. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1612.6599999999999s)]
*  There's plenty of perfectly good things in Israel. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1614.1799999999998s)]
*  They're freedom of press within Israel's mind. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1616.6999999999998s)]
*  They murder all the journalists in Gaza. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1619.34s)]
*  That's a different situation, right? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1621.02s)]
*  There's good people like Dr. Sharon Scholl. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1623.06s)]
*  Sometimes their courts do the right thing, sometimes, etc. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1625.06s)]
*  So but what we're seeing is something shocking that we have never seen before. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1628.02s)]
*  Where government officials in an allied country, a country we fund, are actively saying we [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1632.5s)]
*  should murder children. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1638.86s)]
*  And if you're a doctor and you don't support us inflicting pain on children, starving children [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1640.58s)]
*  and murdering children, you're not a good doctor. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1646.94s)]
*  Sadly, it didn't end there. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1649.94s)]
*  Now, someone who was there at the time of this hearing by the name of Yisar Lifshitz, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1663.74s)]
*  whose son was an Israeli man who was kidnapped and murdered by Hamas. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1670.42s)]
*  You can look, I find the quote that I'm about to read absolutely deplorable. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1677.02s)]
*  But I also understand that when Hamas kills a family member of yours, you're going to [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1684.18s)]
*  want to retaliate and retaliate in incredibly cruel, unfair ways toward people who didn't [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1689.88s)]
*  even do anything wrong, right? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1695.3400000000001s)]
*  And so with that in mind, this is what Lifshitz said, although there are almost no innocents [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1697.18s)]
*  in Gaza, any moral person can understand that starving children is not something we can [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1703.78s)]
*  be proud of. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1709.14s)]
*  This is a person whose own family member was killed by Hamas and is able to see things [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1710.76s)]
*  way more clearly than the scum in the current Israeli Parliament. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1714.9s)]
*  And I mean it when I say scum. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1719.54s)]
*  Not all of them, but the ones who are openly saying that they're in favor of starving [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1721.6200000000001s)]
*  defenseless children to death, they're scum. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1727.7s)]
*  They're scum and we're funding them. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1730.58s)]
*  Is this going to be a point of contention in America now? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1733.1s)]
*  Do we have to debate this on cable news? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1735.2s)]
*  If I say, hey, maybe you shouldn't starve the Palestinian children to death, will I be [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1737.7s)]
*  called an anti-Semite? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1741.46s)]
*  And they answer, you know what the answer is, yeah, they will debate it. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1742.98s)]
*  And yes, we will be called anti-Semitic. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1746.02s)]
*  They'll say, blood libel, blood libel. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1748.58s)]
*  You're saying that the Jews, because it's a Jewish state, are murdering children. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1750.86s)]
*  No, I'm not saying it. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1755.3s)]
*  Government officials are saying it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1757.58s)]
*  And they're saying that if you don't murder children, you're immoral. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1759.3799999999999s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1762.42s)]
*  And I've said it a million times, I'll say it another million. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1764.62s)]
*  It's not all Israelis. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1767.46s)]
*  You see the other Israelis. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1768.82s)]
*  And I agree with Ana, if you Hamas killed your son, you get to be super enraged by it. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1770.34s)]
*  And I don't call you any of those names because you're in a different category. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1774.62s)]
*  You're understandably super upset about something terrible that happened to you, right? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1778.3s)]
*  The others seem to relish killing these children. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1782.78s)]
*  And it's not because they're Jewish or Israel's a Jewish state. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1786.9399999999998s)]
*  Because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1789.74s)]
*  We in the United States have enabled this by saying every time Israel did a massive [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1793.06s)]
*  war crime as something despicable, we said, thank you very much. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1797.9799999999998s)]
*  Here's a new blank check. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1802.06s)]
*  Murder as many people as you like. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1803.54s)]
*  Just absolutely oppress the Palestinians and treat them like they're non-humans and kill [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1805.5s)]
*  as many of their children as they can. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1810.1799999999998s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1811.9799999999998s)]
*  Here's another blank check. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1812.9799999999998s)]
*  That's how the American government caused this catastrophe. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1814.34s)]
*  And Israel wouldn't be in this shape. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1817.06s)]
*  And their government officials wouldn't be this monstrous if we didn't continue to give [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1818.8999999999999s)]
*  them a blank check after every terrible thing that they have ever done. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1822.78s)]
*  Let me read you the rest of his comment. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1827.78s)]
*  He says, there's a line we need to make sure we don't cross. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1829.58s)]
*  Seeing mothers with dead children in their arms, is that what will bring back our hostages? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1832.82s)]
*  Our strength also lies in the justice of our path. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1838.82s)]
*  I just want to say Lifshitz is absolutely right and [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1843.3s)]
*  I commend Lifshitz for having this view. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1846.8600000000001s)]
*  This is the humane view, okay? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1850.94s)]
*  But unfortunately, there are so [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1852.9s)]
*  many members of the current Israeli parliament who don't agree with him. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1854.5800000000002s)]
*  So Har Melek, the lawmaker from the religious Zionism party, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1858.1000000000001s)]
*  scolded him in response though, saying, it's terrible that you even bring that up. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1862.74s)]
*  It's terrible, awful, and horrific that you're talking about starvation [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1869.58s)]
*  when our children were butchered so cruelly. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1874.34s)]
*  What do you think is happening to the Palestinian children? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1877.26s)]
*  The Palestinian children aren't being butchered right now by your government, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1879.3799999999999s)]
*  by your military? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1883.22s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening right now as we speak. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1884.6599999999999s)]
*  And on top of that, as they're being butchered, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1886.98s)]
*  as innocent civilians are being butchered, the Israeli government is blocking [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1889.1s)]
*  humanitarian aid to ensure that either they die suffering in unbearable, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1892.46s)]
*  unspeakable pain, or that they die without any chance of keeping them alive, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1898.3799999999999s)]
*  helping them survive through medical intervention. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1903.6599999999999s)]
*  It's disgusting, and they think they're the moral ones. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1906.54s)]
*  That's the amazing part about all of this. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1909.26s)]
*  Yeah, and he's yelling at, again, the family member of someone who was killed by [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1911.58s)]
*  Hamas as if they don't have, and I don't agree with everything that Lifshitz said. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1915.78s)]
*  I don't agree that there are no innocents in Gaza, but [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1920.6999999999998s)]
*  I get that they are upset about the situation. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1923.06s)]
*  But even so, they say, well, what are we going to do? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1925.3799999999999s)]
*  We should be the monsters that we think we're fighting? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1927.26s)]
*  And the cabinet members go, absolutely, we should be those monsters. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1930.06s)]
*  We should be way worse than their monsters. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1934.42s)]
*  They killed 36 of our children, and we've only killed about 20,000 of theirs. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1936.18s)]
*  Why, we should starve them all to death, all the little babies. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1941.78s)]
*  You see how they're the monsters? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1945.06s)]
*  No, brother, I see how you're a monster. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1946.94s)]
*  So I see how both sides, by the way, 36 kids, terrible. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1949.94s)]
*  We've said it a billion times, terrible, right? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1954.74s)]
*  If you think 36 kids dying by Hamas is terrible, but [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1959.14s)]
*  you don't think 15 to 20,000 children already dead, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1962.1000000000001s)]
*  let alone the starvation that's happening now. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1966.66s)]
*  If you don't think that's terrible, you're basically saying, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1969.02s)]
*  I'm a racist bigot fascist. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1971.94s)]
*  And in this case, you have earned that title, and you say, yeah, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1975.98s)]
*  my babies are relevant, your babies are trash. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1980.8600000000001s)]
*  And I plan on murdering them. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1984.18s)]
*  That's exactly what a Nazi would say. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1985.8200000000002s)]
*  So there is a rabbi who's been vocal in pushing back against this idea [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1989.22s)]
*  that it's totally fine to starve civilian children to death. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1994.54s)]
*  And his name is Rick Jacobs. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=1999.14s)]
*  He penned an op-ed for the Washington Post titled, I'm a Rabbi, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2001.14s)]
*  starving Gaza is immoral. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2004.78s)]
*  And so he called Israel's assault on Gaza a just war, but [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2007.46s)]
*  condemned the blockade of food and humanitarian aid into the region. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2013.1s)]
*  Saying that starving Gazan civilians neither will bring Israel the total [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2018.1399999999999s)]
*  victory over Hamas it seeks, nor can be justified by Jewish values or [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2023.4199999999998s)]
*  humanitarian law. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2027.4199999999998s)]
*  Will this policy bring home the 59 remaining hostages, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2028.7s)]
*  including the 24 who are still alive? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2032.54s)]
*  It's unlikely, and contrary to the wishes of almost 70% of Israelis who, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2034.98s)]
*  in a recent poll, prioritize the hostages return over that elusive total victory. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2039.18s)]
*  Further, he writes that Hamas is willing to sacrifice thousands of Palestinians by [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2044.8600000000001s)]
*  hoarding humanitarian aid. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2049.5s)]
*  Israel must not, depriving Gazans of food and [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2051.34s)]
*  water will not make Israel safer or hasten the return of the hostages. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2053.9s)]
*  Each of us who loves Israel must say so and urge Israel to change this policy. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2059.62s)]
*  So I wouldn't be surprised if this rabbi is currently being attacked by members [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2066.3s)]
*  of the Israeli parliament. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2070.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay, I want to be clear about who he is. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2072.42s)]
*  He's not just a regular old rabbi. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2073.9s)]
*  He's the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2075.54s)]
*  which is the largest denomination for Jewish Americans. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2078.3s)]
*  So he is representing Jewish Americans more than probably anyone is, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2081.86s)]
*  because that's the largest denomination. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2087.5800000000004s)]
*  And he's saying enough, don't. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2090.02s)]
*  So yeah, I don't agree with him that it's a just war, but [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2093.1400000000003s)]
*  of course he's going to say that, right? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2095.3s)]
*  And so you want to have nuance about your positions on Israel. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2097.3s)]
*  God bless, man. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2100.26s)]
*  I'll take nuance, I'll take disagreements around the edges, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2101.54s)]
*  maybe even some core issues, right? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2104.98s)]
*  But if you cross the Rubicon and you say, yeah, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2107.6200000000003s)]
*  let's starve their children to death, there's no discussion with a Nazi. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2111.2200000000003s)]
*  And so, because that's literal, that's literal. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2115.54s)]
*  Let's murder their children is not a thing that you can compromise. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2120.02s)]
*  Let's compromise, murder after children? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2124.66s)]
*  No, but Rick Jacobs is not doing that. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2126.82s)]
*  Rick Jacobs is doing something really moral, outstanding, and [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2129.3s)]
*  absolutely necessary. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2134.46s)]
*  He's basically saying without saying the words, not in our name. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2136.7400000000002s)]
*  And thank you, Rabbi Jacobs for saying that. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2140.54s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2142.94s)]
*  We all appreciate it. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2144.02s)]
*  Everyone should rally around Rabbi Jacobs, okay? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2145.42s)]
*  And say enough because you're driving up anti-Semitism through the roof, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2149.2599999999998s)]
*  through the roof, okay? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2154.5s)]
*  And don't tell me, they hated us anyway. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2156.66s)]
*  No, fill in the blank, Turks, Poles, Jamaicans, it doesn't matter. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2160.22s)]
*  If the whole world sees that group starving children to death, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2165.62s)]
*  they're all going to hate you. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2170.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2173.94s)]
*  Because of what you're doing. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2174.5s)]
*  Wake up, wake up, listen to Rabbi Jacobs, please wake up. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2175.94s)]
*  Because if we here in America, especially rabbis, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2181.18s)]
*  a set of moral leaders don't come forward and say, this is wrong. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2185.94s)]
*  And we need to stop enabling Israel, then we're never going to stop this. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2192.54s)]
*  If you keep sending the checks, they're going to think, we did a great job. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2198.7000000000003s)]
*  America thinks we did a wonderful job. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2202.46s)]
*  It just sent us a $20 billion gift for our war crimes. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2204.7s)]
*  It sent us an $8 billion gift, a $4 billion gift. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2208.22s)]
*  America won't stop giving us gifts for this genocide and ethnic cleansing. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2211.2599999999998s)]
*  Let's do more of it. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2214.94s)]
*  That's the message we're sending here in America. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2216.5s)]
*  And we all have to unite to make sure we do not send that message, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2219.1s)]
*  not in our name. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2223.46s)]
*  All right, we've got a big update on a dual American citizen [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2225.46s)]
*  that has just been released by Hamas. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2230.3799999999997s)]
*  So we'll give you the details on how that deal was made. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2232.34s)]
*  Spoiler alert, Israel was not involved in that negotiation. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2235.54s)]
*  We'll bring that. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2238.9s)]
*  Of course, they didn't want him released. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2239.42s)]
*  All right, back on TYT, Cenk and Anna with you guys. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2240.5s)]
*  I'm going to just read one comment from a YouTube member here. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2255.38s)]
*  Lady AF wrote, and imagine what it's like for [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2259.1800000000003s)]
*  Israel is trying to speak up and getting shut down so aggressively. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2261.1s)]
*  Just for saying simple little things like children shouldn't suffer. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2264.2599999999998s)]
*  So that's the unfortunate climate that Israel is in now. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2268.42s)]
*  So even when good people speak out, they're shouted down by people saying, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2271.58s)]
*  screw the children, who cares? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2276.22s)]
*  We gotta murder them. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2278.06s)]
*  I can't believe you're not a good doctor because you don't want to murder them. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2279.34s)]
*  So it is a deeply oppressive environment right now in that country. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2282.7s)]
*  We're trying to avoid that here. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2286.82s)]
*  I know a lot of countries are in deeply oppressive environments. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2288.1s)]
*  And of course, that's why they go after the journalists first. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2291.34s)]
*  And that's why Israel has murdered more journalists than all other conflicts [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2294.58s)]
*  in the world combined, last year. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2298.74s)]
*  Yes, Anna. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2301.58s)]
*  Well, we're not quite done with the ongoing war on Gaza. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2303.02s)]
*  In fact, there is a big update in regard to the United States and [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2307.2999999999997s)]
*  its position in relation to Israel and the Palestinians. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2311.14s)]
*  So let's get into it. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2316.02s)]
*  Edan Alexander, an American citizen who until recently most thought was [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2318.14s)]
*  no longer living, thought was dead, is going to be released in about two hours, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2324.2599999999998s)]
*  actually. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2330.5s)]
*  And he's going to be released before the eyes of Steve Whitgoff, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2332.1s)]
*  who has done a fantastic job. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2338.66s)]
*  As you just heard, President Donald Trump announced today that a dual American [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2341.82s)]
*  citizen who also unfortunately was a hostage of Hamas has been released by Hamas. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2345.54s)]
*  The individual freed is Eden Alexander, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2352.54s)]
*  the last known American hostage in Gaza. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2355.42s)]
*  And it's important to understand just how Alexander was released, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2358.98s)]
*  how this deal was made through the United States and Hamas. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2363.98s)]
*  So per ABC News, Hamas announced its intention to free Alexander on Sunday, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2368.54s)]
*  describing the decision as a part of the steps being taken to achieve a ceasefire. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2373.58s)]
*  The statement said Hamas had been in contact with American officials over [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2379.14s)]
*  the past few days as part of ceasefire negotiations. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2383.74s)]
*  And that account was backed up by an anonymous source from the United States. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2387.5s)]
*  This US official familiar with the deal to release Alexander told ABC News [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2392.74s)]
*  that the agreement came together in recent days via direct talks between [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2397.58s)]
*  the US and Hamas. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2402.42s)]
*  In other words, Israel was not part of this hostage release negotiation. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2404.86s)]
*  They were not part of this deal. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2409.46s)]
*  We're going to revisit that in just a minute. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2411.3s)]
*  But Trump announced this on Truth Social as well, writing the following. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2413.86s)]
*  I'm grateful to all those involved in making this monumental news happen. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2419.1s)]
*  This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2424.26s)]
*  the efforts of the mediators. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2427.86s)]
*  Qatar and Egypt to put an end to this very brutal war and [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2430.2599999999998s)]
*  return all living hostages and remains to their loved ones. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2433.7s)]
*  Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2438.2599999999998s)]
*  end this brutal conflict. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2442.4599999999996s)]
*  I look very much forward to that day of celebration. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2444.62s)]
*  I mean, he mentions ending the war several times. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2448.7799999999997s)]
*  And it's clear that that is what the president wants. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2451.18s)]
*  And that is good news, how that ends up manifesting, we'll see. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2454.8599999999997s)]
*  But the Trump administration isn't just bypassing Israel. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2459.1s)]
*  They're even calling Israel out for negotiating in bad faith and [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2462.94s)]
*  serving as an obstacle to ending the war. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2467.38s)]
*  According to Channel 12, here's what Steve Witkoff, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2470.42s)]
*  who is the Trump administration's special envoy to the Middle East, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2473.98s)]
*  told hostage families in Israel, quote, we want to bring the hostages home, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2477.94s)]
*  but Israel is not willing to end the war. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2482.82s)]
*  Israel is prolonging it despite the fact that we don't see where else we can go and [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2485.58s)]
*  that an agreement must be reached. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2491.74s)]
*  So you can kind of understand why the Israelis hate Witkoff, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2495.02s)]
*  want to get rid of Witkoff. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2497.98s)]
*  But make no mistake about it, Witkoff is the first American official who's willing [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2499.58s)]
*  to call a spade a spade and call out Israel for [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2504.34s)]
*  serving as an obstacle to a peace deal. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2507.02s)]
*  Yeah, so first off, I'm going to give a lot of credit here to Donald Trump. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2509.18s)]
*  And if you're on the left and you're like, you brought home a hostage and [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2515.26s)]
*  cut out Israel, but he's Trump, boo, I don't want to give him credit. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2518.78s)]
*  What do you need? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2524.0200000000004s)]
*  So did you not want to bring home a hostage? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2526.1800000000003s)]
*  Did you want to make sure he followed the orders of Israeli government? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2528.82s)]
*  I don't know what you want, but I'm a fair person and an honest person. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2533.46s)]
*  Trump deserves a lot of credit for this deal, okay? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2537.42s)]
*  So now, bringing the brother home already is great news, but [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2540.34s)]
*  that also proves a second thing, which is, look at how easy it was. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2544.42s)]
*  All he had to do was remove Israel from the negotiations, talk to Hamas. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2549.5s)]
*  You know what Hamas got in return? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2554.7000000000003s)]
*  Nothing, just a promise that, hey, you know what, we'll keep this in mind, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2556.26s)]
*  it'll create some goodwill. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2560.38s)]
*  Super easy, okay? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2561.82s)]
*  Why are we not getting the deal done? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2564.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, listen to Witkoff. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2565.98s)]
*  Witkoff is telling you, it's because the Israelis don't want peace. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2567.14s)]
*  They want continual war. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2571.2999999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2573.14s)]
*  Because they want to occupy the Gaza Strip and steal that land. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2573.94s)]
*  Right, and look, Witkoff, I just want to note, hasn't lost all hope that there [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2576.42s)]
*  could be a ceasefire deal, although he's kind of going into this with eyes wide open. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2581.9s)]
*  He can see what the dynamic is with Israel involved. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2586.98s)]
*  He says, to the hostage families, there's currently an opportunity window that we [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2589.7799999999997s)]
*  hope Israel and all the mediators will take advantage of. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2594.7s)]
*  We are putting pressure on all the mediators and [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2598.18s)]
*  doing everything we can to bring the hostages home. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2600.42s)]
*  So he still has a little bit of hope, but I can't believe I'm saying this. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2603.98s)]
*  Someone who Donald Trump tapped to serve as his special envoy to the Middle East, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2608.66s)]
*  Donald Trump tapped him. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2613.06s)]
*  He's way better on this issue than who Biden had involved in peace negotiations and [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2615.2999999999997s)]
*  the ceasefire deal. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2623.42s)]
*  It's just incredible to see it. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2624.98s)]
*  Yeah, so look, redemption on every account. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2626.78s)]
*  So we told you this isn't about Jews, this is about foreign governments. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2630.5s)]
*  Witkoff is a Jewish American and he's saying the right thing, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2634.62s)]
*  doing the right thing, representing America. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2637.62s)]
*  And I appreciate it and doing it way better than Anthony Blinken did. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2640.9s)]
*  And so it has nothing to do with religion. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2645.98s)]
*  It has with two different governments. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2648.02s)]
*  One's on the wrong track and we need to stop enabling them. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2650.74s)]
*  We need to help our ally get back to reality and decency and morality. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2654.2599999999998s)]
*  And I'm sure that Witkoff agrees, so [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2659.98s)]
*  that's why he's saying things that are true. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2661.2999999999997s)]
*  Now, at least the second thing. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2662.8599999999997s)]
*  So what do we tell you? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2665.06s)]
*  We told you that the Democrats are a bunch of robots and [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2666.4199999999996s)]
*  they're never going to waver one inch from what the donor class wants, okay? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2669.62s)]
*  Trump is a wild card. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2675.14s)]
*  And that wild card could go disastrously as when he was talking about [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2676.74s)]
*  how we would have ground troops in Gaza and then build a Trump Riviera. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2680.9399999999996s)]
*  Absolute disaster, talking about maybe the occupation of Gaza and [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2684.8599999999997s)]
*  the West Bank, etc. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2689.06s)]
*  But a wild card could also have some chance of going in the right direction. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2690.62s)]
*  So it took a wild card to have an envoy who will say, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2696.14s)]
*  well, the Israelis don't want peace. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2700.4199999999996s)]
*  Truth broke out. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2704.18s)]
*  I know, it's incredible. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2705.14s)]
*  So let's be honest, let's be honest. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2706.98s)]
*  A Democratic envoy would have never said that. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2710.06s)]
*  Not in a million years. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2712.98s)]
*  They would not have had permission to say that. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2713.5s)]
*  Joe Biden's envoy's obviously never said that. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2715.86s)]
*  They would lie on Israel's behalf every time. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2718.3s)]
*  They would say, we really want to get to a ceasefire, but it's of course, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2721.38s)]
*  all Hamas's fault. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2724.18s)]
*  The son of a bitch, Hamas terrorists. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2725.7000000000003s)]
*  Israel's great and wonderful and there's nothing they could do about it. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2727.82s)]
*  My Israel, right? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2730.66s)]
*  So that was Blinken and all the Jake Sullivan and [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2733.14s)]
*  all the loser robots in the Biden administration. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2735.62s)]
*  And Kamala promised to do the exact same thing. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2738.7799999999997s)]
*  So if you're a Democrat, please wakey wakey, right? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2741.1s)]
*  And they won't, no, I bet she would have miraculously turned around 180 degrees and [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2743.98s)]
*  done the right thing. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2749.54s)]
*  No, she promised that she would never do the right thing. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2750.14s)]
*  And so we're not blind about Trump. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2752.7799999999997s)]
*  You're crazy, naive. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2754.8599999999997s)]
*  No, it could get way worse, right? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2755.8599999999997s)]
*  But since he's not a robot, sometimes truth accidentally breaks out. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2758.58s)]
*  Trump doesn't abide by any of the rules associated with traditional [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2763.06s)]
*  political parties in this country, right? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2767.7s)]
*  So this isn't a Republican versus Democrat thing. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2770.94s)]
*  This is a Trump versus typical status quo politician thing. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2775.14s)]
*  Because make no mistake about it, had Trump been any other traditional [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2780.06s)]
*  conservative Republican, we would not be having a conversation about his special [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2784.34s)]
*  envoy admitting that Israel is the one serving as an obstacle to a ceasefire. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2789.5s)]
*  And so look, there are some interesting developments right now because of [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2795.1s)]
*  the fact that Trump has kind of soured on his relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu and [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2799.9s)]
*  vice versa. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2805.06s)]
*  And so that might be changing the dynamic of US foreign policy as it pertains to [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2806.02s)]
*  Israel moving forward, but specifically during the Trump administration. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2811.54s)]
*  I think any other administration that comes after Trump is going to revert right [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2818.1400000000003s)]
*  back to giving Israel everything it wants. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2822.34s)]
*  So here's what I mean. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2824.7000000000003s)]
*  So look, Netanyahu has been pushing the United States to bomb Iran to get [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2826.5800000000004s)]
*  engaged in a hot war with Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2831.42s)]
*  To Donald Trump's credit, he has resisted those calls. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2835.5800000000004s)]
*  He does not want to go to war with Iran. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2839.7400000000002s)]
*  In fact, what he'd like to do is enter a new nuclear deal with Iran to prevent [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2842.26s)]
*  them from building nuclear weapons. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2847.1s)]
*  And I am 100% supportive of Trump's thinking on that. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2849.02s)]
*  Now, the US also ended its strikes against the Houthis or [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2853.3399999999997s)]
*  as Trump likes to say the Houthis who are very brave as he also said. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2858.42s)]
*  Netanyahu didn't like that. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2863.7s)]
*  And again, Trump wants to engage in these negotiations with Iran, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2866.18s)]
*  Netanyahu hates that. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2870.66s)]
*  So here's what NBC News reported on Sunday. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2872.18s)]
*  Netanyahu was particularly upset when Trump said that he had yet to decide [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2874.2999999999997s)]
*  whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium under a new nuclear deal, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2879.2999999999997s)]
*  his administration is negotiating. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2884.18s)]
*  For his part, Trump has been frustrated with Netanyahu's decision to begin a new [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2887.3799999999997s)]
*  military offensive in Gaza, which the President sees as at odds with his [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2892.2999999999997s)]
*  plan for rebuilding there. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2897.22s)]
*  And according to Ilan Goldenberg, who worked on Middle East policy during [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2900.18s)]
*  the Obama and Biden administrations, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2905.62s)]
*  Netanyahu cannot publicly criticize Trump too harshly or really much at all. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2908.74s)]
*  Because apparently, Israelis love Trump, including right wing Israelis. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2914.7799999999997s)]
*  So Netanyahu's whole political strategy and survival strategy is based on [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2920.14s)]
*  holding his coalition and holding his political base together, Goldenberg said. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2924.8199999999997s)]
*  And those folks love Trump, so for [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2930.46s)]
*  him to go very publicly against Trump is something he really can't do. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2932.7s)]
*  So this, Cenk, this dynamic is just really interesting and [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2937.7s)]
*  I hope it keeps going in this direction. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2941.14s)]
*  Because maybe for the first time, I don't want to say that there could be a decoupling [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2943.22s)]
*  of this relationship between the United States and Israel. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2948.18s)]
*  But frostier relations might actually bode well for [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2951.7s)]
*  the lives of innocent people who are currently trapped in Gaza. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2954.62s)]
*  Yeah, so let's break down all the ways that the decoupling is happening. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2957.9s)]
*  It doesn't mean that he can't be reversed. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2961.42s)]
*  He could be reversed at any second and Trump is super fickle and [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2963.02s)]
*  he could go in the disastrous direction at any second. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2966.14s)]
*  Having said that, for now, let's look at the facts without the emotions and [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2969.1s)]
*  the tribalism involved, okay? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2973.1s)]
*  So did he attack Iran when Netanyahu told him to? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2975.2200000000003s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2980.02s)]
*  It's a huge story from the New York Times and [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2982.06s)]
*  there's no question that Netanyahu wanted that attack. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2984.98s)]
*  And my guess is he ordered it like he normally does, right? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2989.1s)]
*  I ordered the American president to attack Iran on my behalf. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2992.86s)]
*  And Trump was like, no, I haven't seen that in my lifetime. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=2996.26s)]
*  So okay, to be fair, you could say, well, Biden didn't attack Iran either. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3002.2200000000003s)]
*  And Obama made a great deal with Iran, and especially Obama. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3005.78s)]
*  Obama did defy Netanyahu. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3009.38s)]
*  Netanyahu did not want that deal and he got us a great deal anyway. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3010.86s)]
*  Okay, so that's all right, not bad, give credit where credit is due. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3014.3s)]
*  But yeah, Obama and others have done something a little similar, okay? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3017.7000000000003s)]
*  And Obama's deal was better. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3021.86s)]
*  So, and I don't say that because I'm a Democrat, because look, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3023.46s)]
*  I'm even talking to Republicans now going, Marjorie Taylor Greene on this show. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3026.78s)]
*  It was like the Obama deal was actually pretty good. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3030.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I never thought I'd see anything like that, right? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3032.82s)]
*  So now, okay, the second thing, he did the deal with the Houthis and [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3036.46s)]
*  he cut Israel out of it. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3040.6200000000003s)]
*  So, and Israel was super mad about it. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3042.18s)]
*  And he said, you're going to stop bombing American ships and [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3044.5s)]
*  we're going to stop bombing Yemen. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3046.94s)]
*  And the Houthis are like, yeah, deal, let's go, right? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3048.58s)]
*  It didn't say anything about stopping the bombing of Israeli ships or [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3051.8599999999997s)]
*  ships headed to Israel. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3055.3399999999997s)]
*  So Israel's like, how dare you? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3058.02s)]
*  You did a peace deal for Americans? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3059.7799999999997s)]
*  And you did not consider Israel first? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3062.66s)]
*  And Trump's like, yeah, that's right, that's what I did. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3065.2599999999998s)]
*  And then the third thing is the hostage deal. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3067.7799999999997s)]
*  Israel doesn't want the hostages released. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3071.06s)]
*  Why? Well, first of all, all right, and [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3073.22s)]
*  by our envoy is telling you that, right? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3074.86s)]
*  Basically, and but the reason they don't want them released is because it's [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3077.98s)]
*  a pretext for we had to bomb Gaza more. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3082.54s)]
*  We had to keep taking more and more of Gaza's land. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3086.1s)]
*  In fact, all of it. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3089.14s)]
*  We had to drive out all the Palestinians into the desert and [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3090.38s)]
*  starve them to death because of the hostages. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3093.18s)]
*  We were defending ourselves from a war that started, I don't know, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3097.34s)]
*  28 years ago or whenever it started. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3100.2599999999998s)]
*  We are still doing self defense as we took to Sudetenland, I mean Gaza, okay? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3103.1s)]
*  So and Trump is like, but there's an American hostage there. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3107.8199999999997s)]
*  Israel's like, no, shut up, don't worry about the American hostage. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3111.9399999999996s)]
*  We need him as a pawn. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3115.02s)]
*  Trump's like, yeah, I don't think so. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3117.2599999999998s)]
*  Hey, Hamas, you want to make a deal? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3118.66s)]
*  You give me the hostage, I give you nothing. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3120.14s)]
*  And Hamas is like, yeah, okay, deal. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3122.2999999999997s)]
*  If you can't say that that was good from Trump, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3125.22s)]
*  then you really do have TDS, okay? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3128.38s)]
*  So that was great and the decoupling is real. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3130.86s)]
*  It doesn't mean it'll hold. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3134.5s)]
*  But if we fully decouple and go Israel, so [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3136.02s)]
*  there's somebody doing this the other day and I loved it. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3138.58s)]
*  Love you, see you, bye bye, okay? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3143.06s)]
*  Hey, listen, you're a grown up country, one of the top 20 economies, enjoy, okay? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3145.82s)]
*  But we don't have to give you endless money. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3149.86s)]
*  Nobody ever said that. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3151.58s)]
*  We don't have to kiss your ass. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3152.7400000000002s)]
*  We don't have to do our entire foreign policy based on you. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3153.78s)]
*  By the way, is Trump doing it out of good neat reasons or [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3156.7799999999997s)]
*  because he's getting a lot of business deals from Qatar, UAE, and Saudi Arabia? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3158.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know, but I don't care too much either, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3163.58s)]
*  because we got to end that genocide. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3165.7799999999997s)]
*  100%. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3167.14s)]
*  And look, we live in a corrupt political system where even foreign governments [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3169.14s)]
*  have sway over our politicians and the presidential administration. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3174.7799999999997s)]
*  If bribery from other players helps balance things out in regard to this war, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3180.9799999999996s)]
*  I will allow it. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3186.54s)]
*  All right, we're going to take a break when we come back for the second hour. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3188.98s)]
*  Man, there's a lot to get into. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3192.62s)]
*  We'll talk about Trump fat shaming one of his business buddies and [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3194.42s)]
*  doing so kind of in a hilarious way. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3200.2599999999998s)]
*  But in the context of making what could be a historic announcement on [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3203.9s)]
*  pharmaceutical drug prices. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3208.22s)]
*  We'll be back with that story and more, don't miss it. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0qKsG0BI-8&t=3209.62s)]
