"Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has warned President Donald Trump that giving amnesty to migrants working in the United States illegally would "break" the MAGA coalition.
In an episode of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, said members of the "ruling class" were pressuring the Republican president to allow farmworkers to stay in the country."

# Trump's Latest Immigration Comments ENRAGES MAGA
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg)
*  Got myself into a little trouble because I said I don't want to take people away from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=0.0s)]
*  the farmers. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  People have worked for a farm on a farm for 14, 15 years and they get thrown out pretty [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=4.28s)]
*  viciously and we can't do it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=8.72s)]
*  We gotta work with the farmers and people that have hotels and leisure properties too. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=10.92s)]
*  We're gonna work with them and we're gonna work very strong and smart. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=16.32s)]
*  And we're gonna put you in charge, we're gonna make you responsible. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=19.76s)]
*  And I think that that's gonna make a lot of people happy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=23.04s)]
*  Now, serious radical right people who I also happen to like a lot. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  They may not be quite as happy but they'll understand, won't they? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=29.48s)]
*  Do you think so? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=32.24s)]
*  Well Trump certainly was right about those serious radical right people not being happy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=36.0s)]
*  with his proposed plan for amnesty. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=40.86s)]
*  But not only will they not be happy about it, this might actually break MAGA. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=43.46s)]
*  So Cenk, before we get into all the details of this, this feels sort of like Trump is [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=47.92s)]
*  trying desperately to appease one faction of his base. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=52.32s)]
*  Knowing that it will upset or even completely alienate or break the other factions. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=56.08s)]
*  So what we're seeing now is Trump kind of playing favorites. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=61.16s)]
*  And it's not surprising which of these two MAGA factions he has decided to favor. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=64.44s)]
*  What do you make of this Cenk? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=69.56s)]
*  Yeah, so this is a really interesting schism. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=70.96s)]
*  And so this is a break that MAGA has from Trump but not in a positive way because they're [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=74.08s)]
*  going even further right wing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=79.08s)]
*  So the two sides as I see it are hardcore MAGA with Trump, not us, but Trump called [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=80.9s)]
*  radical right, seriously radical right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=87.14s)]
*  And the other side has two sets of folks in it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  One is some of the Trump voters that were independents and closer to the center. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=94.78s)]
*  And the polling indicates that they're freaked out by Trump's plan to snatch up people in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=100.54s)]
*  the middle of the country, people doing their jobs, etc. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=106.9s)]
*  And his polling has been hurt by that, we'll show you some of the evidence on that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=109.94s)]
*  But the bigger factor on that side is business interest. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=113.32s)]
*  Okay, say it together. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=116.62s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=119.9s)]
*  Right, so the hotel industries, the farming guys, the leisure industries, including by [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=120.9s)]
*  the way, Donald Trump's businesses are in hotel and leisure and he has used undocumented [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=125.16s)]
*  immigrants throughout his life. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=130.82s)]
*  So those guys want an exemption. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=132.94s)]
*  No, no, no, that's all for the, it's nice little optics about how you're a populist. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=134.46s)]
*  But now give us our cheap labor back, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=139.78s)]
*  So that's something they're not going to be able to come to terms on, right? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=142.46s)]
*  One side is going to win and the other side is going to lose. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=148.34s)]
*  That's why MAGA is kind of furious and fighting back for their position, which you're about [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=151.14s)]
*  to see. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=155.38s)]
*  Yeah, and this all kind of feels inevitable because these two factions of MAGA have always [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=156.38s)]
*  been present, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=161.22s)]
*  There was always the more, the rally goers, let's call them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=162.22s)]
*  And then there were the business people who are voting for Trump because it serves their [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=167.14s)]
*  pocketbooks and their bank accounts to do so. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  So over the past few months, we've seen Trump actually follow through on his promise of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=173.46s)]
*  mass deportations and detainment of immigrants. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=178.54s)]
*  So here's some reporting from NPR. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=181.78s)]
*  It says new data is giving the clearer picture of exactly what that looks like. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=183.5s)]
*  At least 56,000 immigrants are being held in ICE detention. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=188.42s)]
*  According to the Deportation Data Project, a group that collects immigration numbers, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=193.66s)]
*  about half the people in detention don't have criminal convictions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=198.3s)]
*  And that particular group of people is the group that has grown the most in recent months [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=202.74s)]
*  in these detention camps. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=207.9s)]
*  So here's more from NPR. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=209.26s)]
*  It says NPR's review of ICE data found that the number of people without criminal convictions [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=210.74s)]
*  in detention nearly doubled since May, more than any other group of detainees. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=216.9s)]
*  But recently Trump has turned his attention to farm workers and restaurant workers, hotel [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=224.06s)]
*  workers, hospitality people who are in the United States illegally, but not to target [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=234.9s)]
*  He wants to protect them now. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=235.9s)]
*  So according to AP News, the chief executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  stated that 25% to 45% of farm workers stopped showing up to work due to fear of ICE raids. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=242.78s)]
*  Here's what she said. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=250.66s)]
*  She said when our workforce is afraid, fields go unharvested, packing houses fall behind, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=251.73999999999998s)]
*  and market supply chains from local grocery stores to national retailers are affected. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  This impacts every American who eats, which is all of us. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=263.62s)]
*  We all eat, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=267.14s)]
*  When Trump realized that that is a bad thing, good for him, especially for his wealthy friends [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=268.54s)]
*  who own businesses and rely on immigrant labor. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=273.66s)]
*  And Cenk, as he pointed out, Trump is included in that cohort of business people. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=276.58s)]
*  So during a rally on Thursday, Trump announced that he was working on legislation that would [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=282.5s)]
*  allow migrant farm workers who enter the country illegally to stay if their employer could [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=287.32s)]
*  vouch for them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=293.14s)]
*  So let's watch that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=294.14s)]
*  The farmers, some of the farmers, many of you sitting right here, I have four friends [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=296.09999999999997s)]
*  right in the fifth row. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=299.97999999999996s)]
*  But some of the farmers, they've had people working for them for years. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  And we're gonna do something, we're working with Christie. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  And we're gonna do something that we're gonna sort of put the farmers in charge. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=309.24s)]
*  They work very hard and they know very well and some of the farmers are literally, they [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=314.14s)]
*  cry when they see this happen. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=318.9s)]
*  If a farmer is willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Christie, I think we're [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=321.98s)]
*  gonna have to just say that's gonna be good, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=326.5s)]
*  We're gonna be good with it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=328.3s)]
*  Cuz we don't wanna do it where we take all of the workers off the farms. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=330.42s)]
*  We want the farms to do great like they're doing right now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=335.3s)]
*  We're working on legislation right now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  Suzy, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=340.18s)]
*  So generally, MAGA is not too happy about this. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=343.86s)]
*  And they're starting to warn Trump that if he actually follows through with this legislation [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  it will break MAGA. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=352.06s)]
*  So Charlie Kirk, one of Trump's biggest supporters, actually lashed out at Trump and the ruling [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=353.58s)]
*  class pushing Trump to offer amnesty to farm workers. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=358.9s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=362.41999999999996s)]
*  As I am doing this broadcast, and this is bigger than anything with Epstein, this is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=363.41999999999996s)]
*  bigger than anything with tax cuts. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=368.53999999999996s)]
*  It is happening right now in Washington DC. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=370.41999999999996s)]
*  And I can say this from firsthand experience, that people are pushing President Trump for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  amnesty. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=379.29999999999995s)]
*  They are pushing him for mass legalization of illegals. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=380.74s)]
*  Now, President Donald Trump, of course, would never push for amnesty. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  But President Donald Trump said something at a rally on July 3rd and my phone lit up [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=389.78000000000003s)]
*  like you wouldn't imagine. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=396.06s)]
*  President Donald Trump speaking at the Iowa rally saying that we might need to do some [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=397.74s)]
*  form, he didn't use the word amnesty, but some form of soft amnesty. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=405.54s)]
*  And I could tell you now through other reporting that I've been able to do and phone calls, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=409.90000000000003s)]
*  there is a major push right now to do a bipartisan amnesty deal, a major push. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=413.90000000000003s)]
*  People are trying to push the president, hey, you got the money for ICE, now we need to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=420.82s)]
*  go move to the middle on immigration. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  So the Daily Wire's Michael Knowles also slammed Trump on the matter. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=428.94s)]
*  Let's watch him. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=433.26s)]
*  Serious radical right people who I also happen to like a lot. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=434.26s)]
*  They may not be quite as happy, but they'll understand, won't they? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=438.82s)]
*  Do you think so? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=441.58s)]
*  A relatively subdued response from the crowd. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=442.58s)]
*  And President Trump acknowledges, he says, look, we love our radical right people, but [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=444.82s)]
*  they're not gonna like amnesty for illegal aliens who work on farms. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=449.54s)]
*  But they'll understand, right? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=453.62s)]
*  And there's a subdued reaction from the crowd. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=454.98s)]
*  And the reason is this, as I've said before, Trump gets it right 99.7% of the time. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=456.74s)]
*  But I'm not just the cheerleading section for Trump. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=463.42s)]
*  I really like the guy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=466.38s)]
*  I really like him a lot, as you know, and have for 10 years. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=467.42s)]
*  And I think he's done a lot of great stuff. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=469.34s)]
*  I think this could be a perilous objective for him. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=470.94s)]
*  11 million to 16 million illegal aliens in this country. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=476.38s)]
*  If you want to actually start to rectify that situation, you can't just deport the ones [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=480.62s)]
*  with face tattoos. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=484.98s)]
*  You do kind of have to deport at Waila, eventually, at least. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=487.38s)]
*  You can't have just random caravans. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=491.48s)]
*  Well, if you work on a farm, as if what? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=493.7s)]
*  Illegals who work on farms can't commit crimes? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=495.62s)]
*  And it's not only Trump supporters who are breaking with him on this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=501.3s)]
*  It's also his own administration. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=504.3s)]
*  So earlier today, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins went back on Trump's claim and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=506.26s)]
*  stated there would be no amnesty offered to people like farm workers. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=511.46s)]
*  I can't underscore enough. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=517.86s)]
*  There will be no amnesty. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=519.5s)]
*  The mass deportations continue, but in a strategic way. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=521.26s)]
*  And we move the workforce towards automation and 100% American participation, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=524.62s)]
*  which again, with 34 million people, able bodied adults on Medicaid, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=529.38s)]
*  we should be able to do that fairly quickly. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=533.34s)]
*  All right, so but to that end, are there actually able bodied Americans who [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=537.58s)]
*  are willing to do those jobs? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=542.02s)]
*  Last month, Republican Representative Andy Harris suggested to reporters, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=543.94s)]
*  There has to be an effort to figure out how to make sure that we have the workforce [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=548.54s)]
*  we need, whether it's H2A, H2B, whether it's again, a different category that will [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=552.9s)]
*  result in having an adequate number of workers here in the United States to keep [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=557.94s)]
*  the economy going. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=562.14s)]
*  But it's unclear if and when that sort of legislation would be introduced, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=564.02s)]
*  especially since you also have the likes of Tom Homan, who Trump condemned, or [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=567.98s)]
*  he commended actually during his speech announcing the legislation, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=572.46s)]
*  stating that non-criminal migrant deportations would continue. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=575.66s)]
*  Let's watch that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=579.14s)]
*  You're in the country legally, you're not off the table. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=579.74s)]
*  I mean, I see people saying we're arresting non criminals. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=583.62s)]
*  Well, they're in the country legally, that's our job. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=586.42s)]
*  And we told ICE agents in the process going out, look for the bad guy. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=589.1s)]
*  And this is a problem sanctuary cities, when we go to the community to go find [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=592.38s)]
*  the criminal, many times you're with others. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=595.86s)]
*  Others that may not be a criminal target, but they're in the United States illegally, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=597.9s)]
*  they're coming too. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=602.22s)]
*  We're going to force immigration law. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=602.94s)]
*  So, Cenk, there's a lot that is troubling about everything that we're watching [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=605.62s)]
*  right now. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=610.3s)]
*  The question that I have is, who is in charge here? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=611.14s)]
*  Who actually knows what is going on? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=613.98s)]
*  And also the idea that he started off promising gang members and [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=615.94s)]
*  criminals and whoever else. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=620.34s)]
*  And now we're seeing all these other immigrants. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=622.46s)]
*  If you have a quota for how many immigrants you have to deport, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=624.3s)]
*  you're going to have to start deporting people who do not fit that very narrow [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=627.26s)]
*  category of criminals and gang members. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=631.46s)]
*  This was always the inevitable end that was coming. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=633.86s)]
*  And another thing that I find very upsetting about all this apart from [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=636.4599999999999s)]
*  the very obvious is that this is yet another case of the Trump administration [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=640.74s)]
*  staring a problem in the face, seeing it coming and doing nothing to help resolve it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=645.22s)]
*  Instead, they're actually making it worse. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=649.9s)]
*  I'm not just talking about immigration, I'm talking about jobs. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=651.74s)]
*  I'm talking about how we already are living in a very unstable job market, right? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=654.4599999999999s)]
*  People between AI and Doge, they're getting laid off from very high level jobs [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=660.02s)]
*  faster than we can figure out what to do with all of them. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=664.4200000000001s)]
*  They're all newly unemployed, they're in the job market and [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=668.98s)]
*  they don't really know how to navigate it because it's all very new and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=672.02s)]
*  very confusing. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=675.34s)]
*  It's insane right now and jobs that have been traditionally very reliable and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=676.5s)]
*  stable are just not that anymore. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=680.38s)]
*  So people are spending months of active job seeking only to cave and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=682.7s)]
*  take positions that sometimes pay tens of thousands of dollars less than their [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=687.0999999999999s)]
*  previously held jobs. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=691.26s)]
*  And now on top of that, we are deporting people who are doing jobs that don't [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=692.66s)]
*  maybe require formal educations, but they are more physically laborious jobs. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=697.78s)]
*  That frankly, most working class Americans just don't know how to do. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=702.8199999999999s)]
*  So why did they implement any of these policies before considering what to do [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=706.42s)]
*  about the inevitable fallout of those policies? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=710.6199999999999s)]
*  Who is in charge here? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=713.54s)]
*  And Cenk, I guess the question I have for you is, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=715.3s)]
*  what do you think their long term goal is here? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=718.0999999999999s)]
*  If they have one at all, if this all just wasn't some very short sighted [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=720.9799999999999s)]
*  political gamble. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=725.5s)]
*  Yeah, I know what Trump's ultimate goal was, but [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=727.3s)]
*  I don't know who's going to win this fight. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=730.74s)]
*  And so that's, to me, super interesting. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  There's a couple funny things I want to tell you too, but first, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=735.14s)]
*  the poll in the live chat here. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=737.66s)]
*  If Trump introduces amnesty legislation, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=739.66s)]
*  will MAGA break in Charlie Kirk's words? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=742.38s)]
*  Yes or no, curious what you guys think. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=745.14s)]
*  54% saying yes. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=748.46s)]
*  So yeah, I think that MAGA will be irate over this. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=750.9s)]
*  It's just a step below, at least for a super hardcore MAGA, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=756.02s)]
*  step below Epstein files not getting released. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=760.58s)]
*  So okay, let's talk about the funny stuff first. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=765.06s)]
*  My favorite was Michael Nol saying, now I'm no cheerleader for Donald Trump. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=767.6999999999999s)]
*  I only agree with him 99.7% of the time. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=774.6600000000001s)]
*  Glad to find out you're not a cheerleader, okay. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=779.6600000000001s)]
*  Then Andy Harris's quote, that's a Republican congressman. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=782.86s)]
*  I can translate that for you. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=786.62s)]
*  I put it in chat GPT, okay? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=787.7800000000001s)]
*  The translation is, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=791.14s)]
*  we'll do whatever our corporate donors tell us to do. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=792.58s)]
*  So the politicians in Congress, they don't care about MAGA at all, at all. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=795.14s)]
*  They don't care about their voters. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=799.94s)]
*  Democrats don't care about their base. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=801.0200000000001s)]
*  Republicans don't care about, all they care about is, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=802.74s)]
*  how do I make the donors happy while the voters don't find out that I don't [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=805.62s)]
*  care about them at all? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=809.98s)]
*  I'm only serving the people who give me money. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=811.4200000000001s)]
*  So all that is super clear, right? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=814.82s)]
*  Now we get to the interesting unclear stuff. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=816.7800000000001s)]
*  You notice Trump was hesitant about it as he's saying it at the rally. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=820.26s)]
*  He's like, and the right is seriously radical, right? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=824.38s)]
*  They'll understand. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=827.46s)]
*  Do you think so? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=829.4200000000001s)]
*  He asked the crowd. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=831.1s)]
*  Do you think so, right? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=832.46s)]
*  He asked it like two or three times, because he's testing. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=834.5400000000001s)]
*  This is what he does all the time, A, B testing, trial and error. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=838.86s)]
*  So he's like, okay, so we give amnesty to the ones that their business interests [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=842.86s)]
*  want, right, right, right? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=846.7800000000001s)]
*  And the one thing that Knowles was right about was the crowd was subdued. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=848.98s)]
*  They did not look like they were like, yeah? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=852.82s)]
*  So no, they were not enthusiastic about that at all. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=857.1s)]
*  So I think that online media in a lot of ways is the reason why things are shifting and [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=860.62s)]
*  why there are so many fractures. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=865.5s)]
*  Because in the old days, the business interests controlled all of cable news and [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=867.82s)]
*  all of mainstream media. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=872.5400000000001s)]
*  They're all multi-billion dollar businesses. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=874.14s)]
*  That's why the politicians and [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=876.62s)]
*  the media would all say the same lies about economic issues. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=877.94s)]
*  And Fox News and MSNBC would say the same thing about economic issues. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=881.0600000000001s)]
*  Those are the super, what's it called, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=885.14s)]
*  wealthy and powerful and add the same exact talking points. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=887.9s)]
*  Now, the Charlie Kirk's of the world started from what I can see from the outside, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=893.38s)]
*  certainly Dennis Prager, certainly Ben Shapiro, with just money, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=897.9s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars just given to them by right wing billionaires, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=901.62s)]
*  basically for marketing, right? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=905.54s)]
*  Go tell everybody how great tax cuts for the rich are, pretend they help the average [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=908.14s)]
*  American, go tell them how great drilling is for fracking and oil and gas. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=911.9s)]
*  Go tell them, they just bought mercenaries that were basically marketing executives, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=916.22s)]
*  right? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=920.82s)]
*  But now something interesting has happened. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=921.46s)]
*  Now they're getting just as much money, if not more, from their audience because of [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=923.5400000000001s)]
*  YouTube and other platforms. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=927.7s)]
*  So now they're starting to serve a new financial boss, and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=929.7s)]
*  that's their audience. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=933.4200000000001s)]
*  Now that has a lot of upsides. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=934.78s)]
*  To be free of the donor class is great. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=936.26s)]
*  There is a thing called audience capture though. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=939.7s)]
*  So if your MAGA audience says, hey, listen, I don't care what Donald Trump says and [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=941.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't care how much you kissed his ass before and [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=946.06s)]
*  I don't care what your donors tell you about kissing Trump's ass. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=948.4599999999999s)]
*  But when he doesn't release the Epstein files, I'm pissed. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=951.42s)]
*  So then a lot of the hosts are like, okay, I don't want to defy my audience. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=954.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, me too, I'm so mad that they didn't release it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=960.38s)]
*  And maybe they mean it, I don't know. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=963.06s)]
*  And I don't care as long as they say it should be released, right? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=964.38s)]
*  In this case, their audience is pushing them further right and [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=967.54s)]
*  saying no, deport the abuelas as no said, right? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=972.26s)]
*  That is not going to be popular. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=977.98s)]
*  So what MAGA doesn't realize because they're in a bubble just like the people [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=979.8199999999999s)]
*  who thought Joe Biden was young and dynamic were in a bubble. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=984.22s)]
*  They just can't see straight. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=988.3s)]
*  Like he's the best Democrat in the country, is he? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=989.7s)]
*  Is he? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=992.46s)]
*  Okay, and then for Trump, they're like, no, he's, and [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=993.14s)]
*  in this case it's not really about Trump. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=996.66s)]
*  Trump is in the middle here. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=999.62s)]
*  They're trying to win over Trump. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1000.94s)]
*  They're saying, yeah, the country loves it when you deport people's grandmothers. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1003.3800000000001s)]
*  Do they? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1007.94s)]
*  The polling indicates they do not. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1008.7800000000001s)]
*  And so which way is Trump going to go ultimately with the majority of the voters [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1011.22s)]
*  and the majority of the donors or with his hardcore base? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1016.46s)]
*  Well, many times he's chosen his hardcore base, but [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1021.46s)]
*  that's a lot on the other side. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1024.78s)]
*  So but on the other hand, can they really, yes, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1026.46s)]
*  can they really pass any kind of amnesty bill or [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1028.6599999999999s)]
*  a pathway to citizenship bill in Congress with Trump in charge? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1032.8999999999999s)]
*  I would be shocked. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1038.78s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of like just like the overall goal is so muddled and [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1041.3799999999999s)]
*  it feels like they're just making it up as they go. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1044.9799999999998s)]
*  And with Trump, he's usually somewhat predictable, right? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1048.6599999999999s)]
*  Like he plays to the crowd, we know that, but more so than that, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1051.78s)]
*  he plays to the money, to the big money. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1054.82s)]
*  He cares about himself and his money and if anything good comes out of that for [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1057.74s)]
*  the American people, it's because ultimately he doesn't care about the people. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1061.86s)]
*  He cares by extension of himself for [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1065.42s)]
*  his own legacy and his extended long term image. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1067.78s)]
*  But this administration, they do this thing that drives me crazy whenever you see [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1072.06s)]
*  it in movies and television shows. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1075.5s)]
*  He does this thing where he tells he doesn't show, right? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1077.78s)]
*  He says, yeah, people love this. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1080.66s)]
*  They don't love it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1082.9s)]
*  There's all kinds of data that says that people do not support this. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1084.26s)]
*  People do support this and he'll say, the people, they don't like that. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1087.58s)]
*  The example that comes to mind is when he told people that the American people [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1091.78s)]
*  love working and they're mad about having holidays off like Juneteenth. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1096.54s)]
*  That's just a very recent example. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1101.1399999999999s)]
*  But he does all these things and it's so ridiculous. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1102.98s)]
*  And he has to get that feedback from his rally crowds because as we know, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1105.58s)]
*  that is how he's implemented some of his most popular or [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1110.1s)]
*  longest lasting, I'll say, policy decisions and legislation. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1113.54s)]
*  Build a wall happened as a rally cry at a rally and people cheered for it. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1118.82s)]
*  So he was like, all right, I guess we'll build a wall. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1123.82s)]
*  So it doesn't feel like there's any kind of strategic planning here. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1126.74s)]
*  It doesn't seem like there's any kind of long term thinking here. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1131.06s)]
*  It just feels like they're trying their best to appease as many people as they [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1134.46s)]
*  can while getting exactly what they want out of this deal. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1138.22s)]
*  Trump doesn't want to upset his very, very wealthy friends. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1141.82s)]
*  He doesn't want to upset his own business dealings and [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1145.1399999999999s)]
*  the Trump corporation and all that entails. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1148.34s)]
*  We all know that he employs illegal immigrants. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1151.94s)]
*  We all know that he doesn't pay his workers. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1154.62s)]
*  We all know that he loves cheap labor. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1156.46s)]
*  So a lot of these things that he is promising to the American people, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1158.98s)]
*  to his MAGA base, saying he's going to deport all these millions of people. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1161.98s)]
*  This was the inevitable conclusion of that promise that we were going to get here and [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1167.18s)]
*  they would have to kind of pivot at some point to being like, okay, well, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1171.18s)]
*  maybe not just the criminals, maybe not just the gang members. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1174.8600000000001s)]
*  Because maybe your grandmother, she could probably also commit a crime, so [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1178.54s)]
*  let's just deport her as well. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1182.22s)]
*  Yeah, last things real quick here are, look, I know why Trump does what he does. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1183.8600000000001s)]
*  In fact, we've talked about this before, back in 2015 and [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1188.3400000000001s)]
*  even earlier than that, Trump's top aides described by who he went on [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1191.8200000000002s)]
*  concerto talk radio to test his message. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1196.38s)]
*  So he would test pro-immigrant messages and anti-immigrant messages. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1199.02s)]
*  And anti-immigrant messages, of course, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1203.3s)]
*  unsurprisingly with a right wing audience, worked a lot better. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1204.82s)]
*  And so he decided to go in that direction. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1207.66s)]
*  But look at that story that they admit to. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1208.98s)]
*  It's in my book, you can see the exact quotes, just as coming as a book. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1211.98s)]
*  And that shows you, Trump doesn't care. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1216.46s)]
*  He doesn't pro anti, he doesn't care at all about any of the policies, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1219.74s)]
*  let alone immigration. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1224.1s)]
*  He's just like, okay, what's going to get me power and fame and [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1225.06s)]
*  money, okay? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1228.82s)]
*  So anti-immigrant, great, then I'm anti-immigrant. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1229.98s)]
*  But since he doesn't care, that's why there's such a fight. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1232.86s)]
*  If he had principles, this would already be over. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1236.82s)]
*  Like if you said to me, okay, your donors say they don't want paid family leave, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1240.26s)]
*  but your voters do, which one do you want? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1245.06s)]
*  No, I want paid family leave. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1247.9399999999998s)]
*  I think paid family leave is the right policy for America. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1249.46s)]
*  And yes, the voters are overwhelmingly in favor, but [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1253.26s)]
*  that's not a question for me. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1256.58s)]
*  It's a question for Trump, because he doesn't actually have any policies or [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1257.78s)]
*  principles other than Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1261.46s)]
*  And then, so finally, that Brooke Rollins suggestion, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1264.22s)]
*  the agriculture secretary saying, no, no, no, we're not going to need farm workers [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1266.94s)]
*  from now on, because all those people we just kicked off of Medicaid. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1271.3799999999999s)]
*  If they don't want their kids to die from cancer, then now they're going to have to [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1274.62s)]
*  go into the farms and do that job. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1278.5s)]
*  And by the way, at the same rate, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1280.46s)]
*  because our business interests don't want to pay a single nickel more. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1281.82s)]
*  Good luck with that plan, okay? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1286.06s)]
*  Well, I don't want you to have any luck with that plan, but [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1287.86s)]
*  that plan is a disaster and has a 0% chance of success. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1290.4199999999998s)]
*  So they're going to collide at some point. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1293.62s)]
*  Who wins? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1296.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1297.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and just even hearing Trump talk about the radical right is interesting, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1299.74s)]
*  because it's like, who does he think is a radical right? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1303.34s)]
*  And hasn't he just been empowering these people all along? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1305.82s)]
*  And again, this is why we are where we are today. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1309.3799999999999s)]
*  And as he said, if he had any values, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1311.8999999999999s)]
*  we wouldn't also have all the split-flopping that he does. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1313.42s)]
*  Because he would know where he stands on things, and [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1315.9s)]
*  it wouldn't be so much of a question of where he stands from day to day. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1317.98s)]
*  And in the next story, we're going to see a lot more of that actually. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1321.3400000000001s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his swings. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1324.1000000000001s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QdWE5PTYEg&t=1327.18s)]
