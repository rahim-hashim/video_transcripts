# Pants on Fire - April 15, 2025

*  has just been not good. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm so upset, my God. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2.6s)]
*  God. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=5.32s)]
*  All right, welcome to the Young [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=37.28s)]
*  Turks, Cenk Higger, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=38.62s)]
*  Yasmin Khan with you guys. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=39.34s)]
*  Yasmin is on Rebel HQ, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=40.96s)]
*  you know that, you're checking that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=42.26s)]
*  out every day on YouTube and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=44.1s)]
*  then also Modern Context podcast. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=45.64s)]
*  And you know that too, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=47.92s)]
*  you crazy dog. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=49.26s)]
*  Okay, so what are we talking about [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=50.76s)]
*  on the show today? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=52.36s)]
*  A lot, are you ready for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=53.24s)]
*  US citizens to be sent down to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  a dungeon in El Salvador? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=56.56s)]
*  because that is what Trump is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=58.36s)]
*  promising, yes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=60.0s)]
*  But the question is, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=61.64s)]
*  how are people going to react to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=62.64s)]
*  that? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=64.12s)]
*  Is that actually going to happen? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=64.64s)]
*  How is the right wing reacting to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=66.36s)]
*  that? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=67.88s)]
*  Drama, we'll talk about that a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=68.44s)]
*  little bit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=70.08s)]
*  Israeli thought police on the march, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=70.8s)]
*  so they've snatched up more people [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  in America for criticizing Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=75.72s)]
*  One case is enormously egregious, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=79.08s)]
*  we're going to get to that a little [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=80.84s)]
*  bit later. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=82.44s)]
*  And one school fights back, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=83.0s)]
*  that's super important. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=84.62s)]
*  Okay, a lot to get to on this show. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=86.4s)]
*  So Yasmin, what are we starting [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=88.68s)]
*  with? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  We're starting with, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=91.16s)]
*  I mean, they're all doozies. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=92.44s)]
*  Let's just get into this first [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  clip. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=95.56s)]
*  But the reality is this wasn't [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=96.36s)]
*  a Maryland father, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=97.84s)]
*  this was a El Salvadorian man who [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=98.92s)]
*  was illegally in this country, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=101.0s)]
*  who was affiliated with MS-13. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=103.0s)]
*  Let's set the record straight [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=105.0s)]
*  about who this person is. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=106.68s)]
*  There is no evidence that he was a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=108.04s)]
*  gang member. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=109.68s)]
*  With all due respect, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=110.36s)]
*  he's an illegal immigrant. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  He was here illegally with [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=112.6s)]
*  deportation orders in 2019. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  What part of that do you not [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=115.68s)]
*  understand? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=117.12s)]
*  I understand the story very well. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=117.8s)]
*  All right, so that was last night [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=121.08s)]
*  on News Nation and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=122.76s)]
*  that was anchor Hina Doba. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=123.8s)]
*  And they had a fiery confrontation [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=125.56s)]
*  with White House Principal Deputy [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  Press Secretary Harrison Field. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=129.6s)]
*  So the two were going back and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=131.76s)]
*  forth over the allegations that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=133.5s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego Garcia was a member [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=135.38s)]
*  of MS-13. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=137.44s)]
*  So Cenk, we have a lot more of that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=138.88s)]
*  News Nation interview to show [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=140.76s)]
*  the audience, but [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=142.32s)]
*  how do you think this is going to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=143.32s)]
*  go? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=144.76s)]
*  It already seems very contentious. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=145.26s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciated that a little [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  bit of a throw down there from [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=149.6s)]
*  the anchor not taking the lives of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  the Republican. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=152.8s)]
*  And they are, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=154.52s)]
*  huge, huge lies. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  Tons of Republicans and right wing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=156.8s)]
*  hosts are pushing out these lies. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  So we're going to show you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=160.12s)]
*  the reality here. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  We're going to show you the receipts [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=161.8s)]
*  and we're going to show you what [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  this guy actually is and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=165.16s)]
*  what the courts have decided. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=166.28s)]
*  And we'll show you court documents [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=168.88s)]
*  about it, actual receipts here [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=170.52s)]
*  instead of just nonsense [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  jibber jabber from the other side. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=173.44s)]
*  So find out for yourself, but [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  let's watch a little bit more and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  let's see all the details and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=179.84s)]
*  facts here, then I'll weigh in more. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=181.72s)]
*  Right, so we definitely have those [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=184.16s)]
*  receipts and we will get to them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=185.72s)]
*  But yeah, first let's go to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=186.96s)]
*  the clips. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=188.56s)]
*  We have two clips to show you from [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  that News Nation confrontation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=191.24s)]
*  In this first clip, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=193.16s)]
*  Dova and Fields are battling over [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=194.16s)]
*  whether or not Abrego Garcia was [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=196.12s)]
*  actually affiliated with or [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=198.04s)]
*  a part of MS-13, take a look. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=199.84s)]
*  But the reality is this wasn't [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=203.36s)]
*  a Maryland father. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=204.96s)]
*  This was a El Salvadorian man who [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=205.96s)]
*  was illegally in this country who [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=208.16s)]
*  was affiliated with MS-13. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=210.28s)]
*  There is no evidence to that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  Let's set the record straight [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  about who this person is. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=214.6s)]
*  There is no evidence that he was [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=215.92s)]
*  a gang member. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=216.92s)]
*  With all due respect, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=217.44s)]
*  the Department of Justice has come [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  out and said that he has gang [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  affiliations. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=223.04s)]
*  So instead of defending this [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=224.72s)]
*  gentleman, talk about who he [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=226.32s)]
*  actually is and talk about the risk [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  in keeping illegal criminals in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=230.12s)]
*  this country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=232.0s)]
*  This is exactly what President [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  Trump was elected to do, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=234.44s)]
*  to return these people back to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=235.48s)]
*  their home countries, and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=236.64s)]
*  that's what he did. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=237.76s)]
*  We're not defending him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=238.92s)]
*  I'm going to reiterate that is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=239.76s)]
*  substantiated. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=241.28s)]
*  There is no evidence of him being [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=242.32s)]
*  a gang member. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=244.0s)]
*  He was married to, he is married to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=244.68s)]
*  a US citizen and he was in this [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=246.72s)]
*  country legally. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=248.4s)]
*  There's a lot of married [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=249.4s)]
*  gang members. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=250.12s)]
*  Okay, but we don't know if he was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=250.68s)]
*  actually- [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=252.04s)]
*  Being married does not make you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=252.52s)]
*  not a gang member. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=253.6s)]
*  There's no evidence. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=254.68s)]
*  We're going to move on. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=255.68s)]
*  There's no evidence that he was a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=256.36s)]
*  gang member. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=257.24s)]
*  And I want to reiterate that to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=257.76s)]
*  our viewers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=258.76s)]
*  The Department of Justice came out [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=259.28s)]
*  and said there was credible [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=260.52s)]
*  evidence that he was a member or [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=261.56s)]
*  affiliated with MS-13. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=262.8s)]
*  You said he's a gang member and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=263.64s)]
*  he wasn't legally allowed to be [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=264.8s)]
*  here, which again, he was legally [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=266.16s)]
*  allowed to be here. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=268.12s)]
*  And he is married to an American [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  citizen. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  You can hold him for all you want. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=272.04s)]
*  He's no longer in this country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=272.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  The Americans are safer because of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=274.72s)]
*  it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=276.6s)]
*  And- [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=277.12s)]
*  All right, so Dover and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=279.92s)]
*  Fields then fought over [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=281.18s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's immigration status [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=282.44s)]
*  more specifically. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=284.44s)]
*  So let's look at that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=285.56s)]
*  So right now the White House seems [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=288.04s)]
*  to be doing nothing about getting [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=289.12s)]
*  him back and that's fine. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to move on. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=291.16s)]
*  He's an illegal immigrant. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=292.92s)]
*  He was here illegally with [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=294.36s)]
*  deportation orders in 2019. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=295.8s)]
*  What part of that do you not [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=298.32s)]
*  understand? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=299.2s)]
*  I understand the story very well [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=299.88s)]
*  and I'm going to stop going back [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=301.32s)]
*  and forth with you on this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  But I will say again, he had every [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=304.44s)]
*  right to be in this country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  Is there any scenario under which [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  this guy- [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  He did not, he was an illegal [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=309.52s)]
*  immigrant. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  We're going to move on on this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=310.88s)]
*  No, I will not let you go forward. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  He was an illegal alien in this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  country with a deportation order [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  in 2019. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  He is an El Salvadorian citizen. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=318.76s)]
*  If you are not a citizen of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=320.67999999999995s)]
*  the United States of America, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=322.2s)]
*  here illegally, there are grounds [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=324.0s)]
*  to deport you in which [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  recently. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=327.48s)]
*  Again, unsubstantiated, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=329.2s)]
*  those are not the facts, but [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=330.52s)]
*  I will move on. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=331.88s)]
*  Okay, so here is what has actually [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=335.08s)]
*  been stated in court. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=337.04s)]
*  Abrego Garcia did grow up in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=338.64s)]
*  El Salvador's capital city, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  according to the court documents. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=342.08s)]
*  His family had been targeted and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=343.88s)]
*  harassed by a local gang there [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=346.04s)]
*  named Barrio 18. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=348.04s)]
*  So here's some reporting from [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=349.48s)]
*  AP News on that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=350.92s)]
*  When Abrego Garcia was 12, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=351.92s)]
*  the gang threatened to take him [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=353.68s)]
*  away until his father paid them all [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=355.72s)]
*  of the money that they wanted. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=357.8s)]
*  The family moved 10 minutes away, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=359.8s)]
*  but the gang threatened to rape and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  kill Abrego Garcia's sisters, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=363.92s)]
*  court records state. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=365.8s)]
*  So per the court records, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=367.0s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's family could not go [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=368.52s)]
*  to the authorities because of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=370.52s)]
*  police corruption, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=372.12s)]
*  which does track. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=373.36s)]
*  So the family tried to flee to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=374.64s)]
*  Guatemala instead, but [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  even after moving to Guatemala, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=377.64s)]
*  they were still tortured and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=379.4s)]
*  tormented by the gang. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=381.08s)]
*  So Abrego Garcia fled to the US [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  illegally around 2011, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  the year he turned 16, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=386.72s)]
*  according to documents filed in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=388.36s)]
*  his immigration case. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  And in 2019, he went to a Home Depot [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=392.2s)]
*  looking for work when he was [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=394.72s)]
*  arrested by county police, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=396.8s)]
*  according to court filings. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  Detectives asked if he was [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=400.88s)]
*  a gang member. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=402.36s)]
*  So after explaining that he wasn't, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  he was detained by ICE. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=405.8s)]
*  And that brings us up there. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=407.44s)]
*  So Abrego Garcia asked to be [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=410.04s)]
*  released and told an immigration [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=411.8s)]
*  judge that he would seek asylum. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=414.2s)]
*  So this is more reporting. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=415.68s)]
*  US ICE, however, alleged that he [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=417.24s)]
*  was a certified gang member based [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=419.48s)]
*  on information that came from [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=421.72s)]
*  a confidential informant used by [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=423.58s)]
*  county police record state. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=425.88s)]
*  According to Abrego Garcia's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=428.96s)]
*  attorneys in his current case, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=430.68s)]
*  the criminal informant had alleged [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=432.48s)]
*  that Abrego Garcia belonged to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=434.6s)]
*  an MS-13 chapter in New York, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=436.52s)]
*  where he has never lived. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=438.52s)]
*  The information was enough for [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=440.8s)]
*  an immigration judge in 2019 to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=442.6s)]
*  keep Abrego Garcia in jail as his [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=444.68s)]
*  immigration case continued, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=446.68s)]
*  court records state. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=448.56s)]
*  The judge said the informant was [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=450.4s)]
*  proven and reliable and had [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=452.24s)]
*  verified his gang membership and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=453.72s)]
*  rank. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=455.68s)]
*  All right, so in October of 2019 [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=456.2s)]
*  now, an immigrant judge in Maryland [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=458.36s)]
*  granted Abrego Garcia protection [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=460.68s)]
*  from getting deported to El [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  Salvador due to a well-founded [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=464.48s)]
*  fear of gang persecution. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=466.52s)]
*  However, his asylum request was [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  denied by that same judge because [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=470.92s)]
*  he did not file it quickly enough. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=472.96s)]
*  Abrego Garcia was then released [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=475.08s)]
*  from custody and ICE did not appeal. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=477.0s)]
*  So here's more reporting. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=479.44s)]
*  Abrego Garcia checked in with ICE [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=480.64s)]
*  yearly while the Department of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=482.48s)]
*  Homeland Security issued him [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  a work permit, his attorney said [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=485.8s)]
*  in the filings. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=487.68s)]
*  He joined a union and was employed [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=488.84s)]
*  full time as a sheet metal [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=490.92s)]
*  apprentice. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=492.6s)]
*  So he was never charged with or [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  convicted of being a member of MS-13. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=495.64s)]
*  At no point was he convicted of [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=498.48s)]
*  this. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=500.0s)]
*  This year, district judge [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  Paula Zinnis wrote in a court [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=502.32000000000005s)]
*  filing that the quote unquote [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=504.0s)]
*  evidence against Abrego Garcia [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=505.92s)]
*  consisted of nothing more than his [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=508.0s)]
*  Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=510.24s)]
*  a vague uncorroborated allegation [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=512.48s)]
*  from a confidential informant [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=514.84s)]
*  claiming he belonged to MS-13's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=516.84s)]
*  Western clique in New York. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=519.08s)]
*  Again, a place he has never lived. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=521.08s)]
*  And yet, this is what our vice [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=523.32s)]
*  president JD Vance posted this [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=525.32s)]
*  morning on social media. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=527.48s)]
*  He said, the entire American media [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=529.16s)]
*  and left wing industrial complex [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=531.6s)]
*  has decided that the most [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=533.88s)]
*  important issue today is that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=535.54s)]
*  the Trump administration deported [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=537.5799999999999s)]
*  an MS-13 gang member and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  illegal alien. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  But that's not true. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=543.12s)]
*  It's just not true, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=544.4s)]
*  even though it's on truth social. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=545.4s)]
*  So in a truth social post last [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  night, President Donald Trump [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=548.8399999999999s)]
*  called Abrego Garcia an MS-13 gang [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=550.68s)]
*  member and foreign terrorists from [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=552.76s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=554.76s)]
*  So now the question is, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  what are the Democrats doing about [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=558.0s)]
*  all of this? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=559.72s)]
*  It's kind of interesting actually. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=560.52s)]
*  A group of Democratic senators led [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=562.1600000000001s)]
*  by Senator Chris Van Hollen could [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=564.44s)]
*  actually be traveling to El Salvador [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  later this week if Abrego Garcia is [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=568.94s)]
*  not released by then. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=571.26s)]
*  Van Hollen wants to check on [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's condition and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=574.4s)]
*  discuss his release with [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=576.24s)]
*  the government of El Salvador. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  Also representative Maxwell Frost [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=579.76s)]
*  pledged his support as well and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=581.76s)]
*  he stated that he would attempt to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=583.5600000000001s)]
*  bring along other members of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=585.64s)]
*  the House. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=587.32s)]
*  And speaking of the House, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=588.34s)]
*  last night Jen Psaki asked Hakeem [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=589.84s)]
*  Jeffries what Democrats can do to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=591.7600000000001s)]
*  help bring Abrego Garcia home. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=593.7600000000001s)]
*  And here is Jeffries answer. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=596.44s)]
*  What if any power for people who [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=599.48s)]
*  are watching at home, what power [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=601.1600000000001s)]
*  do you have and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  other Democratic members to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=603.88s)]
*  compel, push the government to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=605.5200000000001s)]
*  bring him home? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=607.48s)]
*  Well, we have the power to shape [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=612.6s)]
*  public sentiment and at the end of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=614.0400000000001s)]
*  making sure that public sentiment [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=615.9599999999999s)]
*  in this case understands that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=618.28s)]
*  the treatment of Mr. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=620.28s)]
*  Abrego Garcia is unconscionable, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=621.7199999999999s)]
*  unacceptable and un-American. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  And if it can happen here, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=628.04s)]
*  it can happen anywhere. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, that is a lackluster [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=632.8s)]
*  response from Jeffries. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=633.92s)]
*  If our Congress people are just [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  trying to sway public opinion, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=636.68s)]
*  they're not doing a whole lot. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=638.1199999999999s)]
*  They're the ones who actually have [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  the power to do something. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=641.56s)]
*  Whereas people like us, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=642.52s)]
*  we're the ones who are trying to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=643.5999999999999s)]
*  sway public opinion in one way or [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=644.96s)]
*  another. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=646.4000000000001s)]
*  And everybody on social media and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=647.2s)]
*  people just talking to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  their relatives, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  that's how those things happen. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=650.48s)]
*  We need a little bit more from [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=652.1600000000001s)]
*  our Congress people. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=653.32s)]
*  But Cenk, you know what's crazy to [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=654.48s)]
*  me is that instead of just [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=656.08s)]
*  admitting that their poorly [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=657.2800000000001s)]
*  executed plan inevitably resulted [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  in the wrongful deportation of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=660.76s)]
*  this man. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=662.44s)]
*  Instead, they're just going to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=664.08s)]
*  criminalize him even further and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=665.44s)]
*  demonize him in the press and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=666.88s)]
*  say no, no, no, we were right. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=668.2s)]
*  This man wasn't supposed to be here [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=669.5600000000001s)]
*  in the first place, even though [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=671.12s)]
*  again, as we just showed our [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=672.6s)]
*  audience, the evidence does not [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=674.0s)]
*  support that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=675.52s)]
*  Yeah, there's two reasons why the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=676.96s)]
*  Republicans are doing this. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=678.52s)]
*  There's so much to discuss here. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=679.6s)]
*  So first reason is Trump's [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=681.24s)]
*  insecurities. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=683.04s)]
*  So if he made the decision to send [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=684.4s)]
*  this guy down there without due [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=686.44s)]
*  process and without checking, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=688.4s)]
*  then it must be the correct [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=690.24s)]
*  decision. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=691.6s)]
*  And we don't care that he's [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=692.24s)]
*  innocent and we don't care what [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=693.48s)]
*  the courts say. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=694.84s)]
*  We're just going to keep him down [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=695.56s)]
*  there in the dungeon. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=696.96s)]
*  Ha ha, okay, that's Trump 101. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=697.76s)]
*  Number two is they pick these [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=700.36s)]
*  fights, but they need the left [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=701.92s)]
*  wing to fight back. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=703.56s)]
*  And if you're just deporting [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=704.64s)]
*  criminal undocumented folks, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=706.92s)]
*  there isn't going to be much push [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=709.3599999999999s)]
*  back because most of the country [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=711.3599999999999s)]
*  agrees with that, right? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=713.16s)]
*  So they need something that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=714.56s)]
*  creates controversy. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=716.5999999999999s)]
*  So in order to create controversy, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=718.68s)]
*  they purposely lie, therefore [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=720.88s)]
*  getting the left wing, etc. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=722.9599999999999s)]
*  To fight back and [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  then they pretend to their own [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=726.4s)]
*  voters, my God, you see that the [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=728.8399999999999s)]
*  left wing loves these undocumented [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=731.76s)]
*  criminals and they want to keep [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=734.36s)]
*  the rapists and the murderers and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  the MS-13 gang guys, you see that? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=739.08s)]
*  And so, and unfortunately, this is [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=741.84s)]
*  an enormous part of the puzzle. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=744.4s)]
*  Right wing media in general helps [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=746.6800000000001s)]
*  them and they lie along with [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=749.44s)]
*  the Republican politicians and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=751.72s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=754.24s)]
*  So that their audience thinks the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=756.52s)]
*  guy really is MS-13 and [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=759.0s)]
*  must have committed some grave [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=761.0400000000001s)]
*  offense because they saw [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=762.76s)]
*  JD Vance tweet about it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=764.1600000000001s)]
*  They saw Donald Trump say it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=765.6s)]
*  All their right wing media agrees [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=766.6800000000001s)]
*  well, then it must be true. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=768.44s)]
*  And by the way, guys, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=770.2s)]
*  unlike a lot of folks on the left, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=771.6s)]
*  I don't blame those viewers, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=773.84s)]
*  voters, etc. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  because they were lied to and [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=776.88s)]

*  lied to. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  Some of them do know and some of [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=781.52s)]
*  them will say on social media, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  like, I don't care. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=784.72s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=786.0400000000001s)]
*  And he's not a citizen, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=787.0s)]
*  just do whatever you want with him. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=788.32s)]
*  You sent him to a dungeon, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=790.92s)]
*  torture him. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=792.28s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=793.92s)]
*  He did something. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  He didn't do something. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=795.0799999999999s)]
*  He was a criminal. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=795.92s)]
*  He's not in a gang. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=796.6s)]
*  I don't care, right? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=797.36s)]
*  And some say as long as he's [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=799.0s)]
*  undocumented, which is true, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=801.12s)]
*  then again, that he deserves every [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=803.6s)]
*  faith that he gets and he was [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=806.3199999999999s)]
*  afraid that he was going to be [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=808.4399999999999s)]
*  attacked, possibly killed by [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=810.72s)]
*  the gangs in El Salvador that are [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=813.04s)]
*  in that prison. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=815.6s)]
*  That might kill him, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=816.92s)]
*  that's why our judges said don't [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=818.5999999999999s)]
*  send him to El Salvador, right? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=820.9599999999999s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, but [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  as long as he was undocumented, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=824.8s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=826.4399999999999s)]
*  So that portion exists, but [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=827.0799999999999s)]
*  a bigger portion got lied to and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=828.5999999999999s)]
*  has no idea what the reality is. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  Look, I know that he has just [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=832.04s)]
*  broke it down for you guys, but [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=834.0s)]
*  I want to summarize real quick. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=836.04s)]
*  So if you say he's undocumented, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  no problem, he was undocumented. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=839.7199999999999s)]
*  Okay, and you saw the reasons why. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=841.7199999999999s)]
*  If you say that he was part of [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=843.04s)]
*  MS-13, how much clearer does it [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=845.0799999999999s)]
*  have to be that he wasn't? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=847.8000000000001s)]
*  So some informant, obviously lying, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=850.36s)]
*  said, yeah, he was an MS-13 in New [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  York, he hasn't been in New York. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=855.2s)]
*  He lives in Maryland, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=857.5600000000001s)]
*  has nothing to do with New York. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=858.44s)]
*  And an informant saying that he was [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=860.2s)]
*  an MS-13 to get a lenient sentence [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=862.36s)]
*  or whatever reason that he said it [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=864.44s)]
*  so that he could skate in an [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=866.6s)]
*  innocent guy can go to jail or [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=868.28s)]
*  be deported, wow, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=870.0s)]
*  that would be shocking. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=871.2s)]
*  But again, if you saw it in court [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  paper because they copy and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=874.0s)]
*  did an earlier court hearing where [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=876.2399999999999s)]
*  someone alleged that he was MS-13, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=878.64s)]
*  I get why you were misled, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=881.3599999999999s)]
*  I get it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=883.0799999999999s)]
*  But we're showing you here, later [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=884.2399999999999s)]
*  court proceedings in 2019, or [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=886.68s)]
*  showed that he was not an MS-13 [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=889.1199999999999s)]
*  that made up allegation. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=891.5999999999999s)]
*  But in fact, he was legitimately [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=893.8s)]
*  scared to death that if he sent [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=896.4s)]
*  back to El Salvador, that those [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=898.7199999999999s)]
*  gangs are the ones that would [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=901.16s)]
*  potentially threaten him and [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=903.4s)]
*  potentially kill him. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=905.16s)]
*  And if you say, I don't care, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=906.8000000000001s)]
*  now that I know the truth, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=908.24s)]
*  I still don't care. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=909.52s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to be able to [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=910.6800000000001s)]
*  convince you. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=912.0s)]
*  And so you're a person who just [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  doesn't care about others and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=914.0s)]
*  doesn't have any empathy, etc. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=915.44s)]
*  And I can't ever reach you, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=917.08s)]
*  because the minute you view [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=918.4s)]
*  someone in a different category, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  then you think the worst things in [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=921.44s)]
*  the world can happen to them. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=923.08s)]
*  They can get slaughtered by [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=924.76s)]
*  those same MS-13 gang that I claim [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=926.36s)]
*  that I hate, as long as it's not me. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=928.36s)]
*  I don't identify with a guy, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't care, okay? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=931.96s)]
*  That group, you can't ever get them [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=933.1999999999999s)]
*  to say, yeah, we should all treat [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=935.6s)]
*  all human beings the same way, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=937.64s)]
*  etc, etc. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=939.56s)]
*  But if you're in the larger group, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=940.3199999999999s)]
*  look, I don't know that a lot of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=942.6s)]
*  you are going to see this video, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=944.4s)]
*  you're going to see our posts on [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=946.36s)]
*  social media, etc. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=948.36s)]
*  But if you're in that group, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=949.56s)]
*  you should ask the right wing [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=951.24s)]
*  media and your politicians. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=953.0799999999999s)]
*  And we do it here on the Antitrust, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=955.24s)]
*  we do it to Democrats all the time, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=957.0s)]
*  we get tons of flak for it, right? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=958.88s)]
*  But if you're on the right wing and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=960.8s)]
*  you should ask them, hey, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=962.6s)]
*  why did you tell me he was an MS-13? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=963.84s)]
*  Well, later courts thought that was [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=965.52s)]
*  garbage and didn't think he was [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=967.92s)]
*  an MS-13. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=969.96s)]
*  And that guy you saw, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=971.04s)]
*  Harrison Fields, the White House [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=972.28s)]
*  Principal Deputy Press Secretary [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=974.4s)]
*  that we showed you in that News [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=976.4s)]
*  Nation clip, he said that in 2019, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=977.88s)]
*  there were deportation orders [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=980.04s)]
*  against him. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=981.92s)]
*  When in reality, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=983.32s)]
*  it was the exact opposite. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=984.48s)]
*  In 2019, the court ruled, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=986.4s)]
*  you cannot deport him. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=988.36s)]
*  So he's 100% lying. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=989.96s)]
*  And see, unlike a viewer or [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=994.6s)]
*  a voter that might have heard it [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=996.36s)]
*  somewhere online or in media or [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=998.32s)]
*  whatever, that guy knows, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1000.36s)]
*  he knows for sure. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1002.2s)]
*  And JD Vance knows for sure that [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1004.2s)]
*  they're lying. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1006.4000000000001s)]
*  But hey, we want to trick people [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1008.2800000000001s)]
*  into thinking that the left wing [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1010.4000000000001s)]
*  loves criminals, loves MS-13 gang. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1012.48s)]
*  And we don't mind lying. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1015.8000000000001s)]
*  And then JD Vance said it about [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1016.64s)]
*  the cats and dogs. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1018.2800000000001s)]
*  And it went challenging in an [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1019.72s)]
*  interview, he said, look, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1021.0s)]
*  that might not be true to something [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1022.36s)]
*  with words along those lines. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1024.16s)]
*  But I had to bring your attention [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1025.96s)]
*  to this other issue about gangs in [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1027.8s)]
*  Ohio and undocumented people, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1029.84s)]
*  etc. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1031.76s)]
*  So basically admitted, yeah, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1032.92s)]
*  we lie in order to get attention to [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1034.68s)]
*  a cause that we want. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1036.6s)]

*  look, a lot of right-wing voters [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1145.8799999999999s)]

*  courts ordered him deported when [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1154.6399999999999s)]

*  But now you know at least for sure [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1163.76s)]
*  that you're a giant liar for [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1165.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, and you're doing it [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1167.68s)]
*  to demagogue and spread hatred. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1169.92s)]
*  So have I been clear enough in [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1172.2s)]
*  getting the message out? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1173.76s)]
*  And to the last point, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1174.96s)]
*  yeah, is about Hakeem Jeffries and [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1176.2s)]
*  their response. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1178.24s)]
*  I like Chris Van Hollen's response, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1179.44s)]
*  that's strong, right? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1181.2s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1182.3600000000001s)]

*  Well, will you? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1187.32s)]
*  Because that sounded super strong. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1188.44s)]
*  It sounded like you're really [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  animated about it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1191.3600000000001s)]
*  The guy could barely has a pulse. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1192.32s)]
*  Do something for Christ's sake. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1195.76s)]
*  You've got a tiny modicum of power. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1198.28s)]
*  Try to figure out, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1199.92s)]
*  at least put some thought into how [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1201.04s)]
*  do I strategize to make [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1203.2s)]
*  a difference here. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1204.72s)]
*  So but with Democratic leadership [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1206.92s)]
*  strategizing, it's way too [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1209.3999999999999s)]
*  high a bar apparently. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1211.3999999999999s)]

*  Yeah, Hakeem Jeffries definitely [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1214.32s)]
*  leaves a lot to be desired to the [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1216.32s)]
*  point where it's like how did you [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1218.0s)]
*  even elevate to the position that [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1219.8s)]
*  you're in right now? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1221.48s)]
*  If that's the best he can give us, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1222.96s)]
*  we need somebody else. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1224.3600000000001s)]
*  Like the future, if he's the future [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1225.32s)]
*  of the Democratic Party, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1227.08s)]
*  it's looking a little bit dim and [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1228.3600000000001s)]
*  dull already and [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1229.96s)]
*  that's not very encouraging. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1230.92s)]
*  But to your point, Cenk, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1232.84s)]
*  about not blaming the people who [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1234.1200000000001s)]
*  support these types of moves from [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1235.72s)]
*  the administration, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1237.4s)]
*  I do get what you're saying. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1238.64s)]
*  And the only reason that I do have [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1240.0s)]
*  a small modicum of grace for [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1241.84s)]
*  them is exactly what you said. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1243.3600000000001s)]
*  They're being lied to by people [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1245.32s)]
*  that they for some reason trust. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1247.24s)]
*  And I say it's a small amount of [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1249.44s)]
*  grace because at some point, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1251.16s)]
*  ignorance has to be a choice. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1252.92s)]
*  And these people who are choosing [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1255.16s)]
*  ignorance are voting for policies [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1256.68s)]
*  and politicians based on these [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1258.16s)]
*  beliefs that they hold, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  which are based on things that they [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1260.8400000000001s)]
*  don't understand. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1262.3600000000001s)]
*  And then other people are suffering [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1263.4s)]
*  for these votes that they're [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1265.2s)]
*  casting. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1266.76s)]
*  But right wing media strategy is [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1267.44s)]
*  the same that it has been for so [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1269.1200000000001s)]
*  long. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1270.68s)]
*  They just scared the public with [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1271.24s)]
*  scary words like gangs and [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1272.96s)]

*  process. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1278.16s)]

*  stuff when danger is lurking around [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1280.68s)]
*  every corner, when people's lives [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1282.56s)]

*  are running rampant, or [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1286.16s)]
*  when there's terrorism happening, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  which is what they're being told. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1289.2s)]
*  And what's ironic about that is [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1290.8s)]
*  that the most recent incident of [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1292.2s)]
*  terrorism that I've heard of came [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1293.68s)]
*  from that MAGA guy who torched [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1295.28s)]
*  Governor Shapiro's house. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1296.68s)]
*  I know that's another story, but [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1298.0s)]
*  it is a little ironic. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1299.72s)]
*  But then there is that other [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1301.28s)]
*  aspect to all of this that you [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1302.64s)]
*  mentioned at the end, Cenk. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1304.0800000000002s)]
*  The Supreme Court unanimously, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1305.3200000000002s)]
*  which never happens, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1307.16s)]
*  told that we need to get this guy [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1308.6s)]
*  back. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1310.52s)]
*  But now the Trump administration [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1311.1599999999999s)]
*  and right wing media are acting [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1312.8799999999999s)]
*  like it's all just diplomatically [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1314.52s)]
*  impossible for the United States to [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1316.28s)]
*  take on this president from [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1318.08s)]
*  El Salvador, as if we haven't done [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1319.3999999999999s)]
*  that before. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1321.24s)]
*  Let's be real, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1322.0s)]
*  we know our nation's history. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1322.6799999999998s)]
*  We have taken on entire [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1323.8799999999999s)]
*  governments before. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1325.08s)]
*  If we wanted to negotiate a deal to [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1326.24s)]
*  get this guy back from El Salvador, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1328.24s)]
*  we know we can do that, right? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1330.48s)]
*  No one is doubting that the United [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1332.08s)]
*  States can't get somebody back from [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1333.6799999999998s)]
*  El Salvador if it really wanted to. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1335.3999999999999s)]
*  But they're acting like, too bad, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1337.28s)]
*  there's nothing we can do about it. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1339.2s)]
*  Yeah, so last two things here. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1341.48s)]
*  First, crazy like a fox on [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1343.84s)]
*  tyt.com, one of our members on tyt.com. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1347.28s)]
*  It made a good point here and [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1351.96s)]
*  it goes along the lines of what I [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1353.08s)]
*  was going to say, but [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1354.36s)]
*  he has a specific example. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1355.24s)]
*  He said that mis-framing is exactly [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1356.92s)]
*  what the Democrats did with [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1359.0s)]
*  Gaza protesters. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1360.52s)]
*  And that's a great point. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1362.12s)]
*  And I was going to use a different [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1364.2s)]
*  example, which is, part of the [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1365.84s)]
*  reason why I give some in [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1367.8799999999999s)]
*  the right wing grace when they've [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1369.56s)]
*  heard the wrong information is [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1371.8799999999999s)]
*  because how many of our brothers and [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1373.9199999999998s)]
*  sisters on the left heard the wrong [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1376.24s)]
*  information from MSNBC and [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1378.4399999999998s)]
*  others in the media. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1380.1999999999998s)]
*  That Joe Biden was the best [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1381.84s)]
*  possible candidate for [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1383.1999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1384.3999999999999s)]
*  So we were a go against Donald [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1385.28s)]
*  Trump and that he had no mental [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1386.9599999999998s)]
*  decline issues at all. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1388.6s)]
*  That it was a conspiracy theory, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1389.9199999999998s)]
*  that it was perfectly young and [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1391.3999999999999s)]
*  dynamic behind the scenes when we [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1392.8s)]
*  couldn't see it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1394.3999999999999s)]
*  They got really good people to [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1395.12s)]
*  believe something that was so [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1397.2399999999998s)]
*  obviously not true. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1399.32s)]
*  I mean, Biden couldn't finish [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1401.6399999999999s)]
*  sentences, he's mumbling and [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1403.1999999999998s)]
*  wandering around, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1404.7199999999998s)]
*  shaking hands with invisible [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1405.6799999999998s)]
*  people, talking about how his [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1407.1999999999998s)]
*  uncle was eaten by cannibals. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1408.8s)]
*  And all of the media on the left [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1410.4799999999998s)]
*  were gaslighting people to no end. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1412.4399999999998s)]
*  No, not only is he a good candidate [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1414.76s)]
*  to go against Trump, he was [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1416.9199999999998s)]
*  the very best candidate to go [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1418.76s)]
*  against Trump. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1420.6s)]
*  And the reason I was against that [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1421.7199999999998s)]
*  is because, not just because I have [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1423.6s)]
*  eyes and ears, but he wasn't the [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1425.6s)]
*  best candidate to go against Trump. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1427.36s)]
*  If he went against Trump, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1429.36s)]
*  we were guaranteed a loss. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1430.6s)]
*  And those good people were being [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1431.9199999999998s)]
*  lied to and ironically, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1433.6s)]
*  it was helping Trump. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1434.84s)]
*  because they were going to keep [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1436.0s)]
*  a senile man in the race, right? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1437.6s)]
*  So all those people who didn't [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1439.96s)]
*  believe that Biden was senile, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1441.52s)]
*  who didn't believe that there was [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1443.12s)]
*  anything wrong with him, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1444.84s)]
*  they thought he was a great [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1446.2s)]
*  dynamic candidate before the debate, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1447.6799999999998s)]
*  right? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1449.76s)]
*  They're not bad people, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1450.32s)]
*  they just got lied to, okay? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1451.6s)]
*  So you could make a similar [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1453.52s)]
*  argument, not an identical [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1455.32s)]
*  argument, but a similar one for [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1457.12s)]
*  people who are lied to in [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1459.24s)]
*  the right wing. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1460.76s)]
*  And to our members point here, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1461.84s)]
*  on Gaza, did Biden and [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1464.24s)]
*  the Democrats do any better? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1465.94s)]
*  Bernie did and others did, but [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1468.48s)]
*  overall the Biden administration [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1470.44s)]
*  was like, those protesters, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1472.68s)]
*  how dare they, they're terrible. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1474.72s)]
*  And now Trump has gone further and [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1477.76s)]
*  he's arresting and deporting them. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1479.6s)]
*  But Biden helped their propaganda [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1481.8799999999999s)]
*  and totally lied about who those [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1483.76s)]
*  protesters were. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1485.56s)]
*  So I'm tired of both sides lying. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1486.9199999999998s)]
*  You got to ask better, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1490.08s)]
*  not just of your politicians, but [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1491.24s)]
*  also of your media. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1493.04s)]
*  So, and that's what's gotten us [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1493.9199999999998s)]
*  into this division. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1495.8799999999999s)]
*  And now the last thing is [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1497.6s)]
*  the depressing part here. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1498.52s)]
*  We got it in the live chat again, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1499.3999999999999s)]
*  I was curious about it, if you guys [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1501.1599999999999s)]
*  got more pessimistic about it [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1503.1599999999999s)]
*  overnight, but we had asked this [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1504.9199999999998s)]
*  question yesterday in the live [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1506.9599999999998s)]
*  chat, will Kilmar Abrego Garcia be [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1508.84s)]
*  returned to the US? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1511.08s)]
*  And only 28% said yes yesterday. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1512.32s)]
*  Let's see if we can see it in [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1515.72s)]
*  the live chat. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1516.68s)]
*  Obviously, it shows live at [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1517.2s)]
*  6 o'clock Eastern. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1518.22s)]
*  Everybody check it out when you [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1519.1599999999999s)]
*  can and participate, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1520.32s)]
*  be one of our members or not. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1521.1599999999999s)]
*  So right around the same numbers, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1522.44s)]

*  MS-13 is because there was no due [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1596.3600000000001s)]

*  And I do want to say, for [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1612.04s)]
*  El Salvador, they have had a long [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1613.84s)]
*  history of gang violence and crime [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1616.24s)]
*  and then Bukele came in there. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1618.68s)]
*  And he's had a lot of human rights [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1621.16s)]
*  violations called out against him [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1623.56s)]
*  from the international watchdogs, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1626.32s)]
*  right, for years this has been [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1628.72s)]
*  going on, so this is nothing new. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1630.52s)]
*  And a lot of people down there, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1632.88s)]
*  however, and I actually I randomly [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1634.48s)]
*  know a lot of El Salvadorian [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1636.24s)]
*  people, there's a lot here in [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1637.64s)]

*  El Salvador, so I get some insight [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1640.8s)]
*  there, but and also just from [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1642.6000000000001s)]
*  reading reports online, a lot of [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1644.16s)]
*  people defend Bukele and all of [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1646.04s)]
*  this imprisonment of all these [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1647.76s)]
*  people who he says are gang [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1649.52s)]
*  members also without due process. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1650.96s)]
*  Because they say, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1653.28s)]
*  it's a little bit nicer here now in [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1654.0s)]
*  El Salvador, it's a little bit [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1655.8s)]
*  safer here in El Salvador. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1657.46s)]
*  So that is also an argument that [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1659.08s)]
*  we're hearing now from anchors on [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1660.84s)]
*  places like Fox News that you know [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1662.74s)]
*  what, it's better there now because [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1664.58s)]
*  all these people are in jail. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1666.48s)]
*  And we're going to get to it in [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1668.04s)]
*  another story a little bit more in [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1669.36s)]
*  detail, but that's an argument that [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1670.96s)]
*  we're hearing that can be [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1672.72s)]
*  applicable now to these people here [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1673.96s)]
*  in the United States who Trump [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1675.8s)]
*  wants to just throw in jail. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1677.32s)]
*  But before I get ahead of myself, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1679.0s)]
*  Cenk, that's a whole other story. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1680.8s)]
*  Yep, so we're going to do that [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1683.24s)]
*  very soon as we return. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1684.56s)]
*  So if you thought that was bad, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1685.6s)]
*  Trump is now saying maybe we round [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=1687.36s)]

*  And we're using his system because [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2014.84s)]
*  we're getting rid of our criminals [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2016.8799999999999s)]
*  from out of the United States that [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2018.9599999999998s)]
*  we're allowed to come in by Biden. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2020.84s)]
*  We're getting them out. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2022.8s)]
*  And the president is helping us [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2024.36s)]
*  with that, President Bukele. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2026.52s)]
*  So I was very impressed with him, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2029.24s)]
*  really very impressed. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2030.96s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2032.36s)]
*  So the problem with all of this, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2032.8799999999999s)]
*  apart from the incredibly obvious [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2035.36s)]
*  is that it might not actually be [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2037.96s)]
*  legal to just send people to an [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2040.36s)]
*  El Salvador prison. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2042.62s)]
*  So here is US Attorney General Pam [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2045.28s)]
*  Bondi being interviewed by [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2047.32s)]
*  Jesse Waters on Fox News. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2048.98s)]
*  He asked her about the legality of [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2050.4s)]
*  all of this and [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2052.32s)]
*  she says not a whole lot. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2053.2s)]
*  Now the president was musing about [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2055.04s)]
*  sending some of the most horrible [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2057.24s)]
*  people in this country down to that [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2059.36s)]
*  mega prison, people that push [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2061.48s)]
*  ladies into subways and [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2063.44s)]
*  hit old ladies with baseball bats [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2064.86s)]
*  to the head. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2067.0s)]
*  Is that legal to do? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2067.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that something you're allowed [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2069.16s)]
*  to do? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2071.08s)]
*  Well, Jesse, these are Americans [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2071.64s)]
*  who he is saying who have committed [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2074.0s)]
*  the most heinous crimes in our [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2076.16s)]
*  country and crime is going to [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2078.08s)]
*  decrease dramatically because he's [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2080.16s)]
*  given us a directive that says [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2082.72s)]
*  we need to take the directive to [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2084.72s)]
*  make America safe again. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2086.48s)]
*  These people need to be locked up [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2088.04s)]
*  as long as they can, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2089.7999999999997s)]
*  as long as the law allows. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2090.8399999999997s)]
*  We're not going to let them go [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2092.3999999999996s)]
*  anywhere and if we have to build [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2093.7999999999997s)]
*  more prisons in our country, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2095.3599999999997s)]
*  we will do it. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2096.7599999999998s)]
*  Right, that's what I thought. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2097.3599999999997s)]
*  But she never actually answers [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2101.12s)]
*  the question as to whether or [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2102.7599999999998s)]
*  not any of this would be legal. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2104.2s)]
*  Instead, she just reiterates some [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2105.68s)]
*  Trump administration talking [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2107.24s)]
*  points because that seems to be [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2108.66s)]
*  working for them. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2110.12s)]
*  Because again, who cares if [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2111.08s)]
*  something is illegal as long as [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2112.64s)]
*  people support it, as long as [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2114.4s)]
*  they're able to get away with it. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2116.08s)]
*  So here is another clip from Fox [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2118.28s)]
*  and Friends where the hosts are [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2119.8s)]
*  speaking in support of Bukele's [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2121.34s)]
*  policies in El Salvador. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2123.08s)]
*  His policies, which as I mentioned [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2124.88s)]
*  in the last story, they have been [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2126.76s)]
*  repeatedly flagged by international [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2128.52s)]
*  watchdog organizations for [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2130.52s)]
*  human rights violations. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2132.02s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2133.52s)]
*  Look what's happening in El [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2135.2400000000002s)]
*  Salvador. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2136.28s)]
*  They love this president down there [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2137.08s)]
*  because he has made it so [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2139.0s)]
*  much safer. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2140.36s)]
*  You talk to anyone who is here from [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2141.44s)]
*  El Salvador, and they will say, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2143.48s)]
*  when we go back home, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2145.36s)]
*  it is so much safer. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2146.52s)]
*  They would bring money from [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2147.68s)]
*  America and people would shake [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2149.2s)]
*  them down for that money. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2151.04s)]
*  People who are working here [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2152.84s)]
*  legally or here citizens, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2154.08s)]
*  they send money back home and [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2155.36s)]
*  then their parents are in jeopardy. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2156.6s)]
*  They have to live in poor [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2158.04s)]
*  conditions because if they show [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2159.16s)]
*  that they're getting money from [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2160.6s)]
*  their daughter who works in America, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2162.04s)]
*  then they're at risk, but not [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2163.88s)]
*  anymore. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2165.52s)]
*  The neighborhoods are cleaned up [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2166.04s)]
*  because of this president. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2168.0s)]
*  And it's because if you get caught [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2169.64s)]
*  doing something illegally down [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2171.68s)]
*  there, you're thrown in these [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2173.52s)]
*  maximum security prisons. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2175.2599999999998s)]
*  And you're treated the way you see [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2176.92s)]
*  these videos. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2178.64s)]
*  If we did that here in America, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2179.44s)]
*  maybe the crime would go down even [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2180.88s)]
*  more. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2182.52s)]
*  Well, and the president mentioned [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2183.04s)]
*  that yesterday. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2184.48s)]
*  They might do something with [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2185.2s)]
*  the homegrown people from [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2186.44s)]
*  the United States. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2187.6s)]
*  I don't know exactly how that would [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2188.7599999999998s)]
*  work, more on that throughout the [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2190.24s)]
*  day. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2191.7599999999998s)]
*  That might be challenging. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2192.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay, so Cenk, if we didn't already [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2195.68s)]
*  live in a prison state, Trump of [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2197.44s)]
*  all people is trying to lock up [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2199.24s)]
*  so-called criminals. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2200.88s)]
*  And they're only so-called [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2202.1200000000003s)]
*  criminals because the Trump [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2203.4s)]
*  administration doesn't seem to [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2204.56s)]
*  think that due process is [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2206.1200000000003s)]
*  important anymore. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2207.36s)]
*  But it is actually shocking to hear [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2208.52s)]
*  American newscasters discussing [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2210.48s)]
*  Bukele's policies, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2212.4s)]
*  specifically regarding these [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2213.6000000000004s)]
*  prisons and acting like this is [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2215.36s)]
*  something that we need to bring [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2217.08s)]
*  here to the United States. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2218.6400000000003s)]
*  Because again, this has been flagged [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2220.08s)]
*  by so many human rights [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2221.96s)]
*  organizations because there are [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2223.1200000000003s)]
*  clear violations here. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2224.92s)]
*  Yeah, so look, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2226.32s)]
*  El Salvador's prisons are their [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2227.1800000000003s)]
*  business, not our business. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2229.0s)]
*  So it's not wrong that Bukele's [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2230.68s)]
*  become popular in El Salvador and [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2232.48s)]
*  he's locked up a whole bunch of [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2234.24s)]

*  We don't send US citizens to other [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2242.3599999999997s)]
*  countries because what, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2244.72s)]
*  did we run out of prisons? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2246.56s)]
*  Are our prisons weak and failing [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2248.52s)]

*  a foreign dungeon? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2271.48s)]
*  We don't and is it legal? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2274.04s)]
*  It's not even close to legal. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2275.6s)]
*  Of course, it's not legal. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2276.64s)]
*  Even Pam Bundy, who got the job for [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2277.3999999999996s)]

*  and you say, yeah, but I know but [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2291.0s)]
*  they're really bad guys. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2292.48s)]
*  That doesn't mean anything guys. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2293.64s)]

*  They push someone into a subway. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2297.44s)]
*  Okay, good, then let's give them [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2298.84s)]
*  an attempted murder charge or [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2300.12s)]

*  a murder charge. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2302.08s)]
*  Then let's have a debate about if [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2303.08s)]
*  there should be life in prison [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2304.44s)]
*  without parole or [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2305.6s)]

*  Those are legitimate debates you [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2307.96s)]
*  have inside the country, right? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2309.56s)]
*  What is not legitimate is, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2311.8s)]
*  that was a bad crime. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2313.44s)]
*  So let's just trash our constitution [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2314.44s)]
*  and our laws, not do due process. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2317.32s)]
*  Pick up that person, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2319.76s)]

*  we can't get him back. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2324.92s)]
*  Okay, and so, what you didn't do [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2326.44s)]
*  due process, turns out you picked [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2328.28s)]

*  Well, it doesn't matter because [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2338.32s)]

*  who cares? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2495.4799999999996s)]

*  very important. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2532.4s)]

*  blame the leaders, right? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2539.64s)]
*  But let's see, do his voters [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2543.2000000000003s)]
*  actually agree with him? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2546.16s)]

*  there's hard right MAGA? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2549.2s)]
*  And yeah, they're all over social [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2550.56s)]
*  media, they're the ones going, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2552.08s)]
*  who cares? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2553.56s)]
*  Screw US citizens, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2554.3199999999997s)]
*  screw the Constitution, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2555.3999999999996s)]
*  send them down to El Salvador, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2556.72s)]
*  right? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2558.2s)]
*  But then there's other portions of [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2559.3199999999997s)]
*  MAGA, and then there's [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2561.16s)]
*  the independents, and [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2562.3599999999997s)]
*  there's the people who voted based [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2563.3999999999996s)]
*  on inflation and immigration. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2565.04s)]
*  So that whole spectrum, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2566.44s)]
*  do they agree or [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2567.3999999999996s)]
*  do they not agree, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2568.0s)]
*  all the Trump voters? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2568.68s)]

*  tons of people saying, yeah, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2571.16s)]

*  You can go at Cenk Huger and [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2577.72s)]
*  see if you can tell what [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2578.92s)]
*  the percentage is there, I can't, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2580.12s)]
*  right? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2581.52s)]
*  But that's under my account, right? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2582.1600000000003s)]
*  And my account is a complicated [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2584.04s)]
*  one, it's got independents, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2585.2000000000003s)]
*  it's got right-wing, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2586.2400000000002s)]
*  it's got left-wing, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2587.04s)]
*  it's got everybody, right? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2587.7200000000003s)]
*  Tim Poole, now he would claim he's [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2589.08s)]
*  not right-wing, but I'd be [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2590.84s)]

*  non-Trump voters in Tim Poole's [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2594.52s)]
*  audience. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2596.6800000000003s)]
*  So he did a poll on X, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2597.56s)]
*  take it for what it's worth, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2598.92s)]

*  that should be 98 to 2 and [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2629.2000000000003s)]
*  2 being institutionalized. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2631.0s)]

*  answer, 2 being institutionalized, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2635.08s)]
*  right? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2637.96s)]
*  But 50-50 in a group that largely [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2638.48s)]

*  US citizens to that, again, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2645.32s)]
*  not definitive, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2647.6s)]
*  it's just one data point. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2648.84s)]
*  But so that gives me a little bit [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2650.84s)]
*  of relief that that is that MAGA [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2653.4s)]
*  and all of Trump voters are not [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2656.04s)]
*  lockstep here, and [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2658.44s)]
*  that's super important. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2660.08s)]
*  Because in order for Trump to turn [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2662.32s)]
*  around from anything, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2664.72s)]
*  it has to be very unpopular, and [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2666.2s)]
*  he has to lose a part of his [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2668.22s)]

*  the moment being, just kind of on [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2672.8399999999997s)]
*  day two here, that even a lot of [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2674.7599999999998s)]
*  the guys who say, well, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2676.64s)]
*  if he's undocumented, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2678.06s)]

*  Now, it has to affect Trump. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2686.3599999999997s)]
*  If it doesn't affect Trump and [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2688.08s)]
*  he starts sending US citizens to [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2689.3199999999997s)]
*  El Salvador, it won't matter. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2690.72s)]
*  But my guess is, as we're already [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2692.12s)]
*  seeing in the national polling, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2693.84s)]
*  his numbers are starting to go [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2695.6000000000004s)]
*  down, down, down. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2697.0400000000004s)]

*  because he had already lost [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2701.0400000000004s)]
*  the left. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=2702.32s)]

*  Yesterday, US Immigration and [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3046.44s)]

*  student Mohsen K. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3053.28s)]
*  Madhawi for his involvement in pro [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3054.6800000000003s)]
*  Palestinian activism. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3056.88s)]
*  And he is now facing deportation [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3058.56s)]
*  back to the war-torned occupied [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3060.8s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3063.04s)]
*  So just like in the case of Mahmoud [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3064.1600000000003s)]
*  Khalil, Madhawi is a green card [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3066.32s)]

*  10 years. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3070.44s)]
*  So here's this according to [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3071.64s)]
*  Dropsite. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3073.56s)]
*  Madhawi grew up in a Palestinian [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3074.7599999999998s)]
*  refugee camp in the Israeli [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3076.8399999999997s)]
*  occupied West Bank where his [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3078.66s)]
*  childhood was shaped by [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3080.64s)]
*  the Second Intifada. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3082.2799999999997s)]
*  He experienced significant personal [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3083.8799999999997s)]
*  losses including the death of his [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3086.08s)]
*  best friend during a confrontation [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3087.8599999999997s)]
*  with Israeli soldiers when he was [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3089.8599999999997s)]
*  just 10 years old. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3091.7s)]
*  He later studied computer [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3092.7999999999997s)]
*  engineering at Berzion University [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3094.3599999999997s)]
*  in Palestine before enrolling at [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3096.56s)]
*  Columbia University in New York [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3098.52s)]
*  where he pursued studies and [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3100.64s)]
*  philosophy at the School of General [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3102.04s)]
*  Studies. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3103.8s)]
*  So it's important to reiterate [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3104.32s)]
*  here Madhawi was a green card [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3106.16s)]
*  holder. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3107.92s)]
*  He was not here on a student visa. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3108.84s)]
*  And he was actually in the process [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3111.52s)]
*  of obtaining full citizenship, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3113.52s)]
*  which ICE used to their advantage [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3115.44s)]
*  later, which we'll get to in [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3117.2000000000003s)]
*  a second. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3118.6s)]
*  So Cenk, what are your initial [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3119.16s)]
*  thoughts on this? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3120.48s)]
*  Where do you think this is going? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3121.16s)]
*  Yeah, I know where it's going where [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3122.96s)]
*  Israel locks up everyone who [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3124.52s)]
*  disagrees with them here in America. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3125.8s)]
*  So first they started with student [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3127.8s)]
*  visas, then they went to legal [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3129.8s)]
*  residents who have green cards, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3131.7200000000003s)]
*  who have every right to be here, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3133.6400000000003s)]
*  every right to freedom of speech. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3135.52s)]
*  The Supreme Court has declared that [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3138.0s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3139.96s)]
*  Well, not unless you disagree with [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3142.1200000000003s)]
*  Israel in which case you'll be [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3144.1600000000003s)]
*  whisked away by masked men. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3146.0s)]
*  And they're thinking of sending [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3147.5600000000004s)]
*  him back to the West Bank where if [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3149.48s)]
*  settlers murder him, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3151.4s)]
*  there's no chance they'll be [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3152.8s)]
*  convicted. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3154.8s)]
*  They have kangaroo courts there [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3155.92s)]
*  where they have 99% acquittal rates. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3158.04s)]
*  So we're going to send this guy to [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3160.88s)]
*  his death potentially, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3163.8s)]
*  because Israel said no one should [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3166.08s)]
*  disagree with Israel here in [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3169.04s)]
*  America, your freedom of speech. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3171.52s)]
*  Well, the Supreme Court says [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3174.36s)]
*  resident aliens that are legal [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3175.92s)]
*  residents here in America have [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3177.52s)]
*  the same exact rights, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3179.08s)]
*  their freedom of speech is US [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3180.24s)]
*  citizens. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3181.8s)]
*  So if they no longer have that [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3182.8s)]
*  right, we no longer have that right. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3184.2s)]
*  And we all have to bow our heads to [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3186.52s)]
*  that foreign government. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3187.92s)]
*  Sorry, no, okay, keep slaughtering. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3189.36s)]
*  Keep slaughtering, you haven't [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3192.8s)]
*  murdered enough Palestinian [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3194.36s)]
*  children. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3195.7200000000003s)]
*  That's what we're supposed to say? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3196.52s)]
*  No, I'm not a dog of another [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3198.08s)]
*  government, okay? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3199.6800000000003s)]

*  So they're going to start keep [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3203.44s)]
*  kidnapping, snatching these people [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3205.44s)]
*  off the streets so that, well, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3207.92s)]
*  I was about to say Joe Biden, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3209.88s)]
*  it's also true, Joe Biden. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3211.52s)]
*  He didn't do this much. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3212.8s)]

*  they don't care. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3279.84s)]

*  Tell them more about the case. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3310.04s)]
*  It really just feel like [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3312.04s)]
*  gaslighting and I know it's [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3313.08s)]
*  obviously nothing new. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3314.2400000000002s)]
*  But it's appalling that this [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3315.52s)]
*  foreign country has so much power [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3316.92s)]

*  the most powerful country in [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3320.12s)]
*  the world supposedly. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3321.48s)]
*  So anyway, let's get into why [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3322.64s)]
*  Madhavi was targeted. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3324.2400000000002s)]
*  According to the intercept, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3325.64s)]
*  Madhavi was one of the leaders of [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3327.28s)]
*  the pro-Palestinian movement at [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3329.12s)]
*  Columbia University following [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3331.16s)]
*  the October 7th attacks. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3332.72s)]
*  So here's a reporting, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3334.0s)]
*  it says in December 2023, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3335.2799999999997s)]
*  Madhavi asked Columbia Professor [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3336.92s)]
*  Shai Davidai, a controversial pro [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3338.8399999999997s)]
*  Israel figure at the school to go [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3341.04s)]
*  get some coffee. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3343.04s)]
*  The two met but Madhavi later said [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3344.4s)]
*  that Davidai left in the middle of [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3346.4s)]
*  the coffee. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3348.4s)]
*  Less than two months after [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3349.2799999999997s)]
*  the meeting, Davidai posted a video [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3350.96s)]
*  of Madhavi to Twitter in a thread [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3353.3599999999997s)]
*  characterizing him and [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3355.4s)]
*  other protest organizers as [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3356.96s)]
*  anti-Semitic and pro Hamas. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3358.92s)]
*  So here is that video and tweet, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3360.88s)]
*  take a look. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3362.6400000000003s)]
*  But because there's nothing, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3363.32s)]
*  nothing more honorable than paying [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3365.84s)]
*  for an open court for freedom, for [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3368.76s)]
*  humanity and for justice. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3371.56s)]
*  So Madhavi also appeared on a [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3373.56s)]
*  December 2023 edition of 60 [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3375.92s)]

*  on college campuses. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3381.84s)]
*  So Madhavi was targeted by [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3383.56s)]
*  the pro-Palestinian group [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3385.6800000000003s)]
*  anti-Semitism on college campuses. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3388.08s)]
*  So criticizing Columbia's previous [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3390.92s)]
*  president Manoush Shafik's [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3392.92s)]
*  response to the attacks and [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3394.62s)]
*  stating pro-Israel factions were [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3396.2799999999997s)]
*  trying to silence those who [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3398.2799999999997s)]
*  were protesting the genocide. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3399.88s)]
*  But to be clear, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3401.88s)]
*  he was not anti-Israel. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3402.84s)]
*  He continuously emphasized empathy [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3404.56s)]
*  and dialogue as, quote, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3406.92s)]
*  pathways to justice and [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3408.44s)]
*  peace, per the drop site. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3409.8s)]
*  So Madhavi recalled during a walk [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3411.52s)]
*  out that occurred on November 9th, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3413.7599999999998s)]
*  the person was yelling death to [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3416.12s)]
*  Jews and this is how he responded. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3417.84s)]
*  He said, I was shocked and [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3420.04s)]
*  I walked directly to the person and [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3421.44s)]
*  I told him, you don't represent us [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3423.2s)]
*  because this is not something that [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3425.08s)]
*  we agree with. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3426.92s)]
*  And I took the megaphone and [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3427.92s)]
*  I gave a speech and I said, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3429.44s)]
*  we here are conscious, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3431.12s)]
*  educated students and we know how [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3432.48s)]

*  What this guy has said is clearly [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3436.72s)]
*  anti-Semitic against Jews. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3438.88s)]
*  To be anti-Semitic is unjust, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3440.72s)]
*  is unjust. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3442.7599999999998s)]
*  And the fight for [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3443.92s)]
*  the freedom of Palestine and [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3445.08s)]
*  the fight against anti-Semitism go [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3446.96s)]
*  hand in hand because injustice [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3449.44s)]
*  anywhere is a threat to justice [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3451.64s)]
*  everywhere. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3453.84s)]
*  That's what he said on 60 minutes. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3454.84s)]
*  Madhavi helped lead the pro [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3456.04s)]
*  Palestine movement at Columbia [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3457.88s)]
*  until last spring, which is when [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3460.08s)]
*  the gears started to shift and [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3462.3s)]
*  things started to focus more on [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3464.2s)]
*  building bridges with Jewish and [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3466.16s)]

*  However, he was still a target for [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3470.92s)]
*  multiple Zionist groups like [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3472.84s)]
*  Canary Mission and Baitar, which [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3474.56s)]
*  later worked with the Trump [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3476.52s)]
*  administration to identify students [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3477.96s)]
*  they wanted to deport. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3479.92s)]
*  So here's more, even before his [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3481.48s)]
*  friend and fellow Columbia [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3483.44s)]
*  activist Mahmoud Khalil was [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3485.08s)]
*  arrested by immigration authorities, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3486.7s)]
*  Madhavi asked university [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3489.04s)]
*  administrators to help him find [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3490.6s)]
*  a safe place to live so that he [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3492.48s)]
*  would not be taken by ICE agents, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3494.14s)]
*  according to emails reviewed by [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3496.1s)]
*  the intercept. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3498.0s)]
*  The school did nothing in response, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3499.52s)]
*  Madhavi said. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3501.6s)]
*  When Khalil was abducted by ICE [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3503.2000000000003s)]
*  last month, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3505.2200000000003s)]
*  Madhavi sheltered in place for [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3506.1200000000003s)]
*  three weeks, only coming out when [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3508.04s)]
*  he was scheduled for [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3510.04s)]
*  his citizenship test. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3511.2400000000002s)]
*  And remember when we said earlier [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3512.52s)]
*  that ICE would use this to their [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3514.4s)]
*  advantage, so here's that. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3516.0s)]
*  Earlier this month, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3518.32s)]
*  Madhavi received an email from USCIS [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3519.6200000000003s)]
*  notifying him that he was scheduled [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3521.7200000000003s)]
*  to conduct an interview to obtain [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3523.76s)]
*  his US citizenship. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3525.6800000000003s)]
*  He said he was expecting the [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3527.52s)]
*  interview to take place in December [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3529.2000000000003s)]
*  in line with the expected timeline [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3531.8s)]
*  to move from his green card status [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3533.6400000000003s)]
*  through the naturalization process. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3535.48s)]
*  And then in the middle of his [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3538.0s)]
*  appointment, guess what happened, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3539.44s)]
*  ICE agents came in and arrested him. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3541.4s)]
*  Madhavi was smart enough though and [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3543.76s)]
*  he prepared himself for this. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3545.7200000000003s)]
*  He warned Vermont lawmakers like [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3547.6000000000004s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3549.6800000000003s)]
*  Senator Peter Welch and [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3551.34s)]
*  Representative Rebecca Ballant [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3552.8s)]
*  about the situation. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3554.8s)]
*  And they all responded and [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3556.76s)]
*  they were on standby pending [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3558.1600000000003s)]
*  the appointment. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3559.7200000000003s)]
*  So Cenk, at least he's getting some [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3560.84s)]
*  support from somewhere. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3562.5600000000004s)]
*  He got zero support from Columbia [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3563.6000000000004s)]
*  even when he said this is a threat. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3565.2000000000003s)]
*  They're threatening me. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3567.0800000000004s)]
*  Columbia did nothing to protect him. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3568.2000000000003s)]
*  So he had to call in Bernie Sanders [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3570.1200000000003s)]
*  for backup. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3572.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, looks, I'm Columbia alumni. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3573.5600000000004s)]
*  I went to Columbia Law School and [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv3Cwu1UdDE&t=3575.48s)]
