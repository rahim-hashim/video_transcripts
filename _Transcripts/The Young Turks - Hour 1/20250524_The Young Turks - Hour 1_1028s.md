"Two chemical agriculture industry lobbyists who President Trump chose to serve in his administration are reportedly working behind the scenes to block Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy from placing new restrictions on dangerous pesticides.

According to The New York Times, Nancy Beck and Kailee Tkacz Buller are working to prevent pesticides, including the widely used atrazine linked to endocrine disruption and reproductive harm, from being targeted in a forthcoming Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) commission report, mandated to assess the threat of chemicals and other factors impacting public health."

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# RFK Jr. Just Flopped
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4)
*  As part of his efforts to battle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=0.0s)]
*  chronic illness, Robert F Kennedy [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=2.52s)]
*  Jr. wants to go after pesticides, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=5.42s)]
*  in particular a pesticide known as [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=8.16s)]
*  Atrazine. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=10.74s)]
*  Now, the agricultural industry or [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  I should say agrochemical industry, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=14.8s)]
*  as it's known, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=17.62s)]
*  has no plans of going out quietly. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  As you can imagine, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=21.56s)]
*  they're looking after their [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=22.56s)]
*  profits, they don't want to have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=24.02s)]
*  certain things that they're selling [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=25.72s)]
*  get banned in order to protect [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=27.64s)]
*  the health of Americans. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=29.18s)]
*  And so, unfortunately, that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=31.34s)]
*  industry has some pretty [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=33.54s)]
*  significant allies within [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=35.3s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=37.14s)]
*  And that ended up sparking a war [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=39.26s)]
*  within the Trump administration [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=41.06s)]
*  over what to do about those [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=42.94s)]
*  potentially dangerous chemicals. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=44.46s)]
*  And today we've learned which side [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=46.739999999999995s)]
*  has won. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=48.5s)]
*  So we'll get to that in just a bit, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=49.54s)]
*  but I think it's important to know [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=51.3s)]
*  how this battle was fought and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=52.94s)]
*  all the different moving parts [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  involved. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  So first, here's what you need to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=56.94s)]
*  know. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=58.62s)]
*  Rfk Jr has called Atrazine [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=59.18s)]
*  extraordinarily toxic and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  stated that it's tied to both [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=63.62s)]
*  chronic disease and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=66.02s)]
*  higher rates of cancer, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=67.58s)]
*  seems pretty serious. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=69.36s)]
*  Here's the data on the substance. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=71.06s)]
*  Each year, American farmers spray [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=73.14s)]
*  Atrazine on about 75 million acres [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=75.74s)]
*  of farmland, roughly equivalent to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  the area of New Mexico. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=81.34s)]
*  Atrazine has been detected in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=83.18s)]
*  the drinking water of some 40 [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=85.25999999999999s)]
*  million Americans. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=87.4s)]
*  It is an endocrine disruptor linked [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  to preterm delivery, birth defects, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=92.84s)]
*  and low sperm counts, and possibly [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=96.72s)]
*  to thyroid, ovarian, and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=99.92s)]
*  other cancers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=102.22s)]
*  So hey, conservatives, the ones [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  who are super worried about [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  the birth rates, you're going to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  need your little swimmers to swim [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=107.92s)]
*  effectively in order to fertilize [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  that egg. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's going to be a little hard [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  if the pesticides that are being [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  sprayed on our produce are [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  lowering your sperm count. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=117.08s)]
*  So approximately 60 countries have [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=119.52s)]
*  banned Atrazine. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=122.44s)]
*  Regulating chemicals like Atrazine [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=124.72s)]
*  is a huge priority of the Maha [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  movement, which has brought [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=129.04s)]
*  together a massive tent [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=130.88s)]
*  of supporters. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=132.32s)]
*  And that's the good thing, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=133.2s)]
*  There's that one element to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=134.76s)]
*  RFK Jr. that is somewhat good. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  The fact that there's some buy-in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=138.92s)]
*  on the left and the right when it [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=140.88s)]
*  comes to banning certain pesticides [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=142.68s)]
*  that are really bad for us, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=144.84s)]
*  that cause chronic illnesses. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  So regulating chemicals is [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  a difficult thing to do because of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=150.72000000000003s)]
*  how private interests have a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  stronghold on our lawmakers. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  So the coalition spans from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=157.24s)]
*  environmentalists or [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  environmentalist groups to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=160.24s)]
*  men's rights influencers who [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  are concerned about Atrazine's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=163.68s)]
*  impact on fertility. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  All these people are working [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  together rooting for RFK Jr. to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=168.4s)]
*  ban the chemical. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  Today, the Trump administration [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  released a report listing various [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=173.56s)]
*  causes of chronic diseases in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=177.6s)]
*  But there was a huge battle over [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  whether or not pesticides are [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  included in that report. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=183.2s)]
*  And as we mentioned, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=184.92s)]
*  the agrochemical industry has [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=186.28s)]
*  friends in pretty high places. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=188.28s)]
*  One of them happens to be [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=190.6s)]
*  Nancy Beck. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=192.0s)]
*  She serves as the senior advisor [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=193.32s)]
*  at the EPA's Office of Chemical [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=195.48s)]
*  Safety. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=197.56s)]
*  She was also the person who [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=198.84s)]
*  oversaw the EPA's chemical policy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=200.6s)]
*  in Trump's first administration. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=202.88s)]
*  Now during that time, she helped [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=205.16s)]
*  to deregulate pesticides, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=207.6s)]
*  deregulate them, and directed EPA [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=209.64s)]
*  officials to downplay the dangers [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=211.92s)]
*  of chemicals like Atrazine. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=214.2s)]
*  So the fact that she's a former [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=216.2s)]
*  chemical industry lobbyist might [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=217.88s)]
*  have something to do with that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=219.68s)]
*  The revolving door continues to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=221.2s)]
*  revolve even under Donald Trump who [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=222.88s)]
*  claims that he's against corruption. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=224.88s)]
*  No such thing, he's very much in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=227.24s)]
*  favor of corruption. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=228.64s)]
*  He's appointing people who were [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=229.8s)]
*  very corrupt to his administration. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=231.16s)]
*  So she also worked for a law firm [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=232.8s)]
*  that accounted Syngenta, the company [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  that manufactures Atrazine as one [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=237.84s)]
*  of their clients. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=240.56s)]
*  So in recent weeks, Nancy Beck has [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=241.84s)]
*  pushed back against mentioning [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=244.16s)]
*  pesticides in the Maha Commission [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  report, according to three people [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  with knowledge on the commission's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=251.04s)]
*  discussions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  So you have a super corrupt person [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=254.64s)]
*  in the Trump administration within [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=257.0s)]
*  the EPA essentially working against [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=259.68s)]
*  R.F.K. Jr. in banning the use of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  a toxic chemical that's sprayed on [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=265.32s)]
*  our food and leads to chronic [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=268.32s)]
*  illness. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=270.76s)]
*  Yep, so R.F.K. Jr., [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  complicated brother, so when he was [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  running, I liked his housing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=277.32s)]
*  policy, his money out of politics [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=279.88s)]
*  policy, hated his stance on [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=283.0s)]
*  vaccines, Israel randomly. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=285.6s)]
*  The first thing he did at Health [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=288.68s)]
*  and Human Services was say that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=291.84s)]
*  criticizing Israel is bad for [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=293.76s)]
*  your health, which might actually [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=295.64s)]
*  be true, but in kind of dark ways. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, so there's a lot I disagree [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=301.0s)]
*  with R.F.K. Jr. on, but pursuing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=303.64s)]
*  this, pesticides, additives, etc., [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=306.24s)]
*  are they safe or are they not safe? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that, right? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  And so that's not kooky at all. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=314.0s)]
*  It's not, hey, vaccines leading to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=315.64s)]
*  autism, we've studied that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=317.64s)]
*  a million times. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=319.2s)]
*  This stuff we have not studied [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=320.24s)]
*  nearly enough, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=321.72s)]
*  And we're all concerned about [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=323.24s)]
*  the damage that it could do. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=324.68s)]
*  But my jury's out on it, and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=326.04s)]
*  I give you more research. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=327.48s)]
*  Give me something that gives me [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=329.12s)]
*  peace of mind in either direction, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=331.0s)]
*  right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=333.12s)]
*  So now this is an interesting [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=333.88s)]
*  battle, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  Now we got, in this case, R.F.K. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=336.08s)]
*  Jr. is trying to do something [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=337.68s)]
*  positive, and now we criticize him [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=339.08s)]
*  for the things he did negative. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=340.68s)]
*  Okay, so let's see how this turns [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  out, who's got more strength, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  Maha or the donor class? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=346.32s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=347.88s)]
*  Well, it looks like R.F.K. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=349.4s)]
*  Jr. is outnumbered, okay? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  Because there's another corrupt [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=354.44s)]
*  figure that I want to mention here [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=356.08s)]
*  and that's Kaylee Buller, or Bueller. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=357.67999999999995s)]
*  She's the chief of staff at [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  the US Department of Agriculture. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  And in the past few years, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  she served as the president and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  CEO of not one, but two seed oil [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  industry lobbying groups. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  I've heard a lot about seed oil [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=372.23999999999995s)]
*  lately, I heard that's really bad [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=374.2s)]
*  for you, interesting, okay. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=376.4s)]
*  Bueller, anyone on seed oil? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=378.36s)]
*  Their member companies rely on [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=382.6s)]
*  crops like soybeans, canola, and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=384.8s)]
*  sunflower seed, which are commonly [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  grown using atrazine and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=390.24s)]
*  other pesticides. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=392.2s)]
*  Now Bueller is another figure who [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=394.8s)]
*  didn't want pesticides to be [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  included in that report that we [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=398.04s)]
*  were talking about, and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=399.6s)]
*  we're not done yet, there's more. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=400.8s)]
*  Okay, in April, 79 Republicans in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=402.64s)]
*  Congress weighed in on the matter, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=405.24s)]
*  sending a letter that urged Kennedy [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=407.96s)]
*  and other members of the Maha [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=410.52s)]
*  Commission to resist efforts from [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=412.67999999999995s)]
*  activist groups promoting misguided [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  and sometimes malicious policies, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=417.88s)]
*  masquerading as health solutions. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=420.52s)]
*  Citing a petition calling on [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=423.84s)]
*  the commission to eliminate toxic [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=425.44s)]
*  pesticides from the food supply. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=427.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good idea, let's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=429.55999999999995s)]
*  keep the toxic pesticides in [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=430.76s)]
*  the food supply, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=431.79999999999995s)]
*  that seems like a brilliant idea. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  As long as those Republican [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=433.79999999999995s)]
*  senators are getting paid off, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=434.88s)]
*  I mean, they're getting campaign [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  contributions with people they [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=437.6s)]
*  happen to agree with. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=439.04s)]
*  So according to the New York Times, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=442.0s)]
*  R.F.K. Jr. was pushing to include [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=444.36s)]
*  atrazine in this report, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=446.8s)]
*  as you can imagine. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=448.64000000000004s)]
*  And it is included, but not as much [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  as some in the Maha movement [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=452.44s)]
*  would like. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  And so here's an excerpt from [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=455.8s)]
*  the report, so you can kind of get [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  a sense of what we're talking [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=458.44s)]

*  insecticides. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=463.68s)]

*  another herbicide, atrazine, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=476.04s)]

*  birth defects. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=480.76000000000005s)]
*  See, that's an actual study. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=482.6s)]
*  So when it's studies that say [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=484.20000000000005s)]
*  vaccines don't cause autism, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=486.40000000000003s)]

*  I agree. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=495.24s)]
*  Now here's a study that says, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=496.0s)]
*  this thing could be really [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=497.72s)]
*  problematic and lead to birth [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=499.12s)]
*  defects and other things. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=500.76s)]
*  And everybody in Washington is [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=502.52s)]
*  like, you never listen to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=503.88s)]
*  the studies, okay? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=505.04s)]
*  The scientists are full of crap. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=506.24s)]
*  You listen to industry that has [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=507.64s)]
*  bribed us. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=509.08s)]
*  I mean, given us campaign [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=509.6s)]
*  contributions, because we [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=511.04s)]
*  coincidentally agree, WIC. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=512.6s)]
*  So let's put this next graphic up. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=514.4s)]
*  So atrazine is also listed in [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=517.52s)]

*  Unfortunately though, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=585.08s)]
*  there's another problem. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=586.4s)]
*  R.F.K. Jr. only has so much power [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=587.76s)]
*  over how that chemical is regulated, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=590.16s)]
*  of course, because he's not, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=592.92s)]
*  he can't unilaterally make [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=594.96s)]
*  a regulation banning it. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=596.76s)]
*  You need Congress to get involved, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=598.32s)]
*  you need other government [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=599.84s)]
*  agencies to get involved. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=600.8s)]
*  And so the FDA, which is under his [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=602.2s)]
*  jurisdiction, can regulate pesticide [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=604.92s)]
*  residues in food. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=608.0s)]
*  However, it's the EPA that regulates [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=609.96s)]
*  pesticide use. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=612.88s)]
*  And the EPA is currently being run [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=614.36s)]
*  by a super corrupt figure who used [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  to work for this industry. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  So, Ana, at the end of the day, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=620.72s)]
*  who won? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=622.84s)]
*  Well, it appears that the person [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=624.88s)]
*  who won, or the, I shouldn't say [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  person, because it's actually [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=628.48s)]
*  a group, is the agrochemical [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=630.1600000000001s)]
*  industry. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=632.0s)]
*  A big donor class won again. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. That is so surprising. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  Because they've infiltrated [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=638.36s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=639.48s)]
*  And it's not just [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=640.36s)]
*  this administration. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=641.08s)]
*  This is the disease that we see in [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=642.0s)]
*  most administrations these days. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=644.28s)]
*  Yeah, guys, it's not like Biden or [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=647.24s)]
*  the Democrats banned this stuff. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=649.24s)]
*  It's not like they called for [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=651.52s)]
*  more research and studies. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=652.72s)]
*  But neither did the Bush [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=654.32s)]
*  government, neither did [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=655.28s)]
*  the Obama government, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=656.24s)]
*  neither did any government. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=657.28s)]
*  And so, to me, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=658.48s)]
*  that's not the question. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=659.44s)]
*  The question is, they claimed that [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=661.2s)]
*  they were populist and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=663.6s)]
*  they were different, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=665.12s)]
*  MAGA and MAHA, right? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=666.54s)]
*  And let's acknowledge that MAHA is [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=668.48s)]
*  awkward, unless you're Hawaiian. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=670.16s)]
*  And it feels kind of right. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=671.52s)]
*  Okay, so then they said, no, no, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=673.56s)]
*  we're populist, we're different. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=675.36s)]
*  We're not going to listen to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=677.16s)]
*  the donor class. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=678.36s)]
*  What happened now? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=679.72s)]
*  It's the same uniparty. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=680.84s)]
*  The thing that upsets me the most [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=682.36s)]
*  about it is that the Republican [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=684.6s)]
*  voters wanted the corruption out. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=687.16s)]
*  I believe the voters, okay? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=689.84s)]
*  I actually do believe the voters. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=692.04s)]
*  I think that they see this [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=696.12s)]
*  political system. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=697.36s)]
*  They see how corrupt it is, and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=698.16s)]
*  heard one party claim that they [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=700.6s)]
*  were going to change things. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=702.52s)]
*  And it just sucks because this is [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=704.72s)]
*  why so many Americans who are [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=707.08s)]
*  eligible to vote don't engage in [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=709.16s)]
*  politics at all, never vote. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=711.7s)]
*  Because they don't think anything [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=714.72s)]
*  will ever change. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=716.16s)]
*  They don't think they really have [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=717.36s)]
*  a real option to reform things [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=719.08s)]
*  within our government, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=720.64s)]
*  within our system of government. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=721.96s)]
*  And so, I have a lot more empathy [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=724.36s)]
*  for Americans of all political [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=727.12s)]
*  persuasions these days. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  Because what options do we have? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=732.68s)]
*  The corruption is so ingrained in [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=734.28s)]
*  our political system at this point. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=735.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and so for [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=737.68s)]
*  the Democratic voters, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=738.7199999999999s)]
*  I feel the same thing, right? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=740.2399999999999s)]
*  A lot of Democrats think because [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=742.64s)]
*  they were told by their media, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  no, no, no, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=746.0s)]
*  these are the good guys, right? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=746.52s)]
*  And my God, Biden would love to get [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  money out of politics, but [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=749.8399999999999s)]
*  golly gee, there's nothing he [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=751.12s)]
*  could do. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=752.68s)]
*  I mean, the actress, I mean, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  he would, my God, he's so empathetic. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=754.4799999999999s)]
*  He cares so much about you. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=756.5999999999999s)]
*  The Palestinians, he'd love to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=758.12s)]
*  help the Palestinians, but [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=759.5600000000001s)]
*  he golly gee, just can't seem to do [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=760.88s)]
*  any of those things, right? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=762.24s)]
*  The public option, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=764.32s)]
*  he's really in favor of it, then [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=765.08s)]
*  why didn't he introduce it ever? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=766.32s)]
*  Okay, and it's just a lie on top of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=768.12s)]
*  a lie on top of a lie. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=770.12s)]

*  the Democratic voters? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=772.16s)]

*  Biden hoping and believing that he [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=775.2s)]
*  was going to do those things, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=777.36s)]
*  right? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=779.2s)]
*  Because the media constantly lies [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=780.28s)]

*  wage. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=792.32s)]

*  He's a liar. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=796.08s)]
*  So I blame Biden, but [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=797.32s)]
*  I don't blame Biden's voters. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  I blame Trump, but [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=800.72s)]

*  And then when you apply that [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=803.1600000000001s)]
*  to Maha, I would say that most to [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=804.6400000000001s)]
*  that group, okay? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=806.5200000000001s)]
*  Because there's a ton that I [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=808.36s)]
*  disagree with Maha on the vaccines, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=809.9200000000001s)]

*  etc. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=813.5200000000001s)]
*  So I'm not co-signing on [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=814.0200000000001s)]
*  the policies. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=815.4000000000001s)]
*  But do I think Maha really wanted [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=816.8800000000001s)]
*  to change the system and [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=818.68s)]
*  hates the corruption and wanted to [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=820.12s)]

*  Yeah, I believe that the voters of [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=828.36s)]
*  Maha definitely wanted that, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=830.4s)]
*  Of all the people who want change, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=833.08s)]
*  they were among the top people who [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=834.92s)]
*  want to change. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=836.72s)]
*  Even if we don't agree with [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=837.96s)]
*  the kind of change, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=839.24s)]
*  some of the change that they [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=840.1999999999999s)]
*  wanted, right? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=841.48s)]
*  And did they get what they want? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=842.08s)]
*  No, they didn't get it either, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=844.64s)]
*  right? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=846.2s)]
*  And so, and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=846.96s)]
*  this is a perfect example. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=847.56s)]
*  But guys, look, I know I'm crazy, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=848.4399999999999s)]
*  and I still believe, and [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=850.76s)]
*  I still think that we can make [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  a difference. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=854.24s)]
*  But that's why I started Rebellion [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=855.52s)]
*  PAC, because these guys are never [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=857.3199999999999s)]

*  How do you make sure that the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=860.64s)]
*  politicians are going to be honest? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=862.04s)]
*  You make sure they don't take [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=863.72s)]
*  corporate PAC money, right? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=865.16s)]
*  So that's why everybody in [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=866.96s)]
*  Rebellion PAC, Randy Bryce, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=868.04s)]
*  Richard O'Genter, Ro Khanna, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=869.28s)]
*  none of them take corporate PAC [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=870.56s)]
*  money. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=871.8s)]
*  Because once they take the money, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  it's over. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=873.68s)]
*  I mean, look at all these guys. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=874.6s)]
*  All of a sudden, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=875.96s)]
*  it's messing with all of our [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=877.1600000000001s)]
*  systems and causing birth defects [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=878.6s)]
*  and poisoning us all. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=880.2800000000001s)]
*  But the corporate check cleared, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=881.84s)]
*  I'm good, I'm good, right? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=883.4000000000001s)]
*  And they'll poison you in a second [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=884.5200000000001s)]
*  for a goddamn check, right? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=886.6s)]
*  So that's why the Rebellion PAC [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=888.5200000000001s)]
*  guys are clean. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=890.2s)]
*  They're fighting for [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=891.2800000000001s)]
*  the policies we all care about and [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=892.5200000000001s)]
*  believe in. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=894.44s)]
*  So there's only one hope left. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=895.6s)]
*  The Republicans are always going to [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=897.84s)]
*  Republican, okay? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=899.36s)]
*  And what did I tell you? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=900.48s)]
*  You told me Trump's going to be [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=901.8000000000001s)]
*  different. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=903.08s)]
*  No, $5 trillion tax cut, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=903.6s)]
*  the majority of which goes to [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=904.84s)]
*  the rich. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=906.2s)]
*  Told you, right? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=907.12s)]
*  We're not going to cut Medicaid and [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=908.52s)]
*  Medicare. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=909.84s)]
*  They cut Medicaid and Medicare, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=910.52s)]
*  right? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=911.84s)]
*  Same thing with Biden and [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=912.4399999999999s)]
*  all of his fake promises. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=913.72s)]
*  So you tried every other option. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  In my opinion, the only option [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=918.0s)]
*  left is populist left, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=919.8s)]
*  the Bernie wing. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=921.2s)]
*  And if you had to name two honest [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=922.4399999999999s)]
*  people in politics, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=924.36s)]
*  who would you name? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=925.56s)]
*  So if you're a mainstream media, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=927.3199999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden and Donald Trump, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=929.0s)]

*  Donald Trump. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=931.48s)]
*  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=932.16s)]
*  No, okay, Bernie Sanders and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=933.2s)]
*  Thomas Massey, okay? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=935.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=937.4s)]
*  One is on the left, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=937.92s)]
*  one's on the right, right? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=938.5600000000001s)]
*  They're principled. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=939.72s)]
*  They're principled. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=940.6s)]
*  Now I don't agree with Massey. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=941.72s)]
*  I agree with him on the budget, but [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=943.4s)]
*  I wouldn't agree with him on some [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=945.16s)]
*  cuts, etc, right? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=946.84s)]
*  But by the way, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=948.84s)]
*  I also agree with him on Israel, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=949.8000000000001s)]
*  and I also agree with Bernie on [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=951.6s)]
*  Israel, right? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=953.0s)]
*  because once you're honest and [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=953.8000000000001s)]
*  you're not beholden to the cash, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=955.2s)]
*  why would you want to work for [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=956.76s)]
*  AIPAC? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=958.12s)]
*  Yeah, you have moral clarity. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=958.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, why would you want to work [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=960.24s)]
*  for the big drug companies, right? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=961.52s)]
*  So that's a real dialogue between [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=963.24s)]
*  Massey and Bernie Sanders, right? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=965.1999999999999s)]
*  And so what we're doing, and [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=967.92s)]
*  the Massey wing doesn't exist. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=969.7199999999999s)]
*  They thought it was Trump, and [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=972.04s)]
*  who is Trump fighting with most [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=974.04s)]
*  right now in Congress? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=975.92s)]
*  Thomas Massey, right? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=977.48s)]
*  So although the Massey wing could [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=979.24s)]
*  exist in the political world, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=981.4s)]
*  there is no coalition there. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=983.3199999999999s)]
*  Trump took that coalition and [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=985.76s)]
*  let it down the exact wrong path. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=987.24s)]
*  Yeah, misdirected. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=989.0799999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=989.88s)]
*  So, but the Bernie wings still [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=990.6s)]
*  exist, the Roe Connors, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=992.72s)]
*  the Nina Turner's and so [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=994.8s)]
*  many others, now Rebellion PAC, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=996.0s)]
*  right? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=997.8s)]
*  And they are clean. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=998.3199999999999s)]
*  Can you just try that once? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=999.9599999999999s)]
*  The one honest guy in politics, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=1002.9599999999999s)]
*  can we try that wing, right? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=1004.9599999999999s)]
*  If we do that, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=1007.48s)]
*  I think we could have an answer. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=1008.24s)]
*  But otherwise, these guys are going [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=1009.92s)]
*  to, and by the way, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=1011.52s)]
*  the driving force behind all of [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82tFVkJYpy4&t=1012.36s)]
