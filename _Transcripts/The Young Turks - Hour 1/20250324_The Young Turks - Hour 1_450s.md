TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Trump Triggered by Portrait & George Clooney, FLIPS OUT on Truth Social
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg)
*  Judge, and I say this with a unblemished record of heterosexuality, he looks good. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=0.0s)]
*  And he looks hard. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=8.8s)]
*  Does he? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=10.84s)]
*  Okay, that's what Trump is wondering, because there's a portrait of him in Colorado that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=11.84s)]
*  he does not like. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=15.92s)]
*  He doesn't think it looks hard. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=17.44s)]
*  So let me give you Trump's statement, and then I will show you that portrait. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=20.34s)]
*  And then we'll give you a couple more pictures of Donald Trump, and then we'll have you vote [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=25.28s)]
*  on him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=27.88s)]
*  That'll be super fun. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=28.88s)]
*  So Trump wrote over the weekend on True Social, nobody likes a bad picture, a painting, or [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=30.36s)]
*  painting of themselves. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=35.12s)]
*  But the one in Colorado, in the state Capitol, put up by the governor along with all the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=36.12s)]
*  other presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=40.08s)]
*  seen before. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  The artist also did President Obama, and he looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=48.92s)]
*  the worst. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=53.96s)]
*  She must have lost her talent as she got older. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=56.0s)]
*  Again, we'll show you the two picture portraits next to one another in a second. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=59.08s)]
*  But he continues his mad diatribe, because this is the important stuff in the world, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad the President of the United States of America, the Commander in Chief, is focused [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  on this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=71.64s)]
*  In any event, I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=72.64s)]
*  But many people from Colorado have called and written to complain. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=77.1s)]
*  Have they? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=79.84s)]
*  Have they? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=80.84s)]
*  In fact, they're actually angry about it, are they? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=81.84s)]
*  I'm speaking on their behalf to the radical left governor, Jared Polis, who's extremely [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=84.8s)]
*  weak on crime, in particular, in respect to Trendo Aragua, which practically took over [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=89.84s)]
*  Aurora. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=94.84s)]
*  Don't worry, we saved it to take it down. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=95.84s)]
*  Jared should be ashamed of himself. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  So I'll get back to Jared Polis in a second. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  But first, I know you're wondering about the picture. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  We kinda showed it there in the Jesse Waters clip. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=104.08s)]
*  But here, let's take a look at the portrait. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=106.16s)]
*  My God. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  My God, I didn't know it was that bad. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  Holy cow. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=112.88s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=113.88s)]
*  What is he talking about? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=114.88s)]
*  That's Donald Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=117.52s)]
*  That's like the most normal portrait I've ever seen of any human being. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  What in the world is he referring to? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so let's look at Obama and his, and let's see if Obama looks gorgeous and Trump [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  is purposely distorted. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=131.56s)]
*  We needlessly researched this story. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=134.72s)]
*  Apparently, people complained that Obama's portrait wasn't that good. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=137.24s)]
*  Maybe he got an issue with this artist, but I think the Obama one looked like Obama and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=142.44s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=146.76s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=147.76s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=148.76s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=149.76s)]
*  But apparently, Trump does. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=151.48s)]
*  Trump is obsessed by it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=152.64s)]
*  So he then put up two pictures of himself that I presumably is, okay, I want it to look [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=154.32s)]
*  like this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=159.72s)]
*  So this is Happy Smiley Trump from the first term. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=160.72s)]
*  And yeah, we do have a poll on it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=163.68s)]
*  That's why you should watch the show live. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=166.0s)]
*  It's super fun. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=167.24s)]
*  Although we have this up on YouTube community as well, I believe. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=168.24s)]
*  So Trump, Happy Smiley one, and then he put up a second one, Blue Steel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=171.12s)]
*  Well, at least we're calling it Blue Steel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=178.32s)]
*  There you go. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=180.8s)]
*  I actually think that one looks way worse than the official portrait in Colorado. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=181.8s)]
*  So but hey, I'm gonna leave it up to you guys. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=187.12s)]
*  You guys vote in the live chat as we're doing it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=188.72s)]
*  Which photo does Trump look dumber in? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=191.88s)]
*  The Colorado portrait, Happy First Term Trump or Blue Steel Second Term Trump? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=193.78s)]
*  Pick them right there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  But okay, so now you wanna know the reality? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=201.88s)]
*  Yeah, the portrait was unveiled in 2019, but it was commissioned in 2018 before Polo Steven [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=206.16s)]
*  took office. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=212.2s)]
*  So guess who commissioned it? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  Colorado Republicans. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=216.44s)]
*  And they raised over $10,000 to get that portrait. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=218.2s)]
*  So as usual, he did none of the homework. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=221.77999999999997s)]
*  He attacked his own Republicans without realizing it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  So Senator Oragwa did take over some apartment complexes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=227.72s)]
*  Did they took over the entire town of Aurora? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=232.12s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=234.76s)]
*  And so that is clear. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=236.64s)]
*  But look, guys, the reason I do this story is because, not because, my God, it's the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=238.2s)]
*  most important story and Trump's the worst for doing this or anything like that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=241.4s)]
*  No, it's because he's so vain. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=244.32s)]
*  He's such a gigantic narcissist. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=248.6s)]
*  He's so obsessed with himself. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=252.04s)]
*  Brother, you're the President of the United States. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=253.96s)]
*  Do some Presidenting. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=256.68s)]
*  And look, to be fair, he came in like a whirlwind and he did a lot of things and the great majority [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=258.88s)]
*  which I don't agree with. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=264.36s)]
*  But he just can't stop obsessing about himself and going on these diatrops about how he looks. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=266.16s)]
*  No matter how much power he gets and adulation he gets, it's never enough. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=274.38s)]
*  Cuz that well of insecurity is endless. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=279.04s)]
*  One last thing about it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=282.32s)]
*  He then this again today going after George Clooney. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  But who cares about George Clooney? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=288.44s)]
*  Who cares what he said in his 60 minutes interview? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=290.52s)]
*  But no, he can't let it go. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=292.78s)]
*  So what did Clooney say? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, by the way, that's the other thing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  He not only looks ridiculous when he does this, but he also then needlessly highlights [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=296.4s)]
*  other people like George Clooney. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  So now I find out what Clooney said about him because he attacked him. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  So here's what Clooney said. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=306.44s)]
*  When the other three states fall, when the judiciary and the executive and the legislative [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=307.88s)]
*  branches fail us, the fourth estate has to succeed. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=310.76s)]
*  ABC has just set a lawsuit with the Trump administration and CBS News is in the process. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=313.52s)]
*  We're seeing this idea of using government to scare or fine or use corporations to make [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=318.2s)]
*  journalists smaller. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=322.44s)]
*  Totally agree with this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=324.12s)]
*  It's a great point he made on 60 minutes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=325.12s)]
*  And then he says, governments don't like the freedom of the press. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=327.44s)]
*  They never have and that goes for whether you're a conservative or liberal or whatever side [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=330.76s)]
*  you're on. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=334.84s)]
*  So that's a really important topic and we're gonna talk about it later in the program. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=335.84s)]
*  Because Elon Musk is now trying to sue people that criticize him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=339.36s)]
*  And Donald Trump is going after all the media companies. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=346.76s)]
*  What happened to free speech absolutists? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=349.92s)]
*  But that's a really important topic we'll handle later in the show. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=350.92s)]
*  Of course, watch the show every day Monday through Friday, 6 to 8 o'clock Eastern on [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=354.32s)]
*  YouTube. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=358.56s)]
*  But so how did Donald Trump bitch about this? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=359.56s)]
*  Well, here's what he said. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  Why would the now highly discredited 60 minutes be doing a total puff piece on George Clooney, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=364.44s)]
*  a second rate movie star and failed political pundit? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  He fought hard for sleepy Joe's election and then right after the debate dumped him like [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=373.4s)]
*  a dog. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  Later, I assume under orders from the Obama camp pushed all out for Kamala. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't know why is Kamala in quotes? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=382.44s)]
*  That is actually her name. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=384.7s)]
*  Only soon to realize that was not gonna work out too well to of course misspell 60 minutes [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=386.2s)]
*  even fraudulently sort of fake answers into a disastrous interview. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=390.96s)]
*  No, they didn't. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  Air just before election day in one of the most embarrassing and dishonest events in [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  broadcast history. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=398.23999999999995s)]
*  And now George Clooney again, his press agent should be making a fortune. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=399.23999999999995s)]
*  My God, if I was elected president, would I spend all day obsessing about what Kid Rocks [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=405.24s)]
*  thinks of me? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=414.03999999999996s)]
*  Or whether your portrait in Hawaii or Rhode Island of me is good enough, do important [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  things. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=422.84000000000003s)]

*  The things he's been doing are not great, so maybe not. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=425.48s)]
*  Maybe just focus on just keep looking in the mirror 24 seven, okay? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  Is it good enough? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=433.16s)]
*  Is it good enough? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=434.16s)]
*  I'm good enough, aren't I? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=435.16s)]
*  Hey, Stuart Smalley, commander in chief, move on, dump the insecurity and try to get some [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=436.16s)]
*  work done or don't. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=444.16s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3IynkYv8lg&t=447.08000000000004s)]
