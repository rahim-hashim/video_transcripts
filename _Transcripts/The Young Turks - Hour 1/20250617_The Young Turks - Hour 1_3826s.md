TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Dave Smith & Cenk Uygur Agree To UNITE Against The War
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs)
*  You said the other day that you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=0.0s)]
*  regret voting for Donald Trump. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1.28s)]
*  You stick by that, do you regret it? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  You went as far as saying [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  impeached, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=5.3s)]
*  you still believe that today, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=5.8s)]
*  and why? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=7.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=7.68s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=8.64s)]
*  Charlie Kirk are all out there [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=10.8s)]
*  right now saying, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=12.72s)]
*  you will destroy your coalition if [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  you do this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=16.36s)]
*  You will absolutely split MAGA into [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  a civil war against each other. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=19.52s)]
*  You said you're a radical [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=21.72s)]
*  libertarian, don't like [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=22.96s)]
*  the militarization, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=24.28s)]
*  worried about the tyranny of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=25.32s)]
*  government, etc. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=26.6s)]
*  So are you opposed to the Marines [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=27.44s)]
*  in LA? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=28.8s)]
*  Well, joining me now, Dave Smith, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=29.48s)]
*  he's one of the leading libertarians [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  in the country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=33.72s)]
*  His show is called Part of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=34.68s)]
*  the Problem. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=36.24s)]
*  And he has just said that he is [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  upset that he voted for Donald Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  So we're going to talk to him about [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  it, and we're going to see if we [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=44.72s)]
*  could find a mutual answer for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=46.64s)]
*  the problem of going to war in Iran, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=48.46s)]
*  which neither one of us want to do. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=50.72s)]
*  Dave, welcome back. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=52.72s)]
*  Thank you, Cenk, thank you so [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  much for having me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, no problem. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=56.52s)]
*  So first, let's talk about whether [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=57.64s)]
*  we should talk, then we'll talk [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=59.88s)]
*  about what we talked about in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=61.84s)]
*  the past. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=63.68s)]
*  And then we'll finally get to how [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=65.0s)]
*  do we end this war, okay? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=66.48s)]
*  How do we stop this war? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=67.76s)]
*  So first, we asked our audience, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=69.04s)]
*  should we form a coalition with [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=70.68s)]
*  the right against the war with Iran? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=72.16s)]
*  Because a lot of people on the left [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=74.36s)]
*  say no, no, no, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  the right is verboten. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=76.8s)]
*  Don't ever talk to them, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=78.64s)]
*  don't have a beer with them, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=79.72s)]
*  don't do anything with them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=80.92s)]
*  Young Turks members are totally [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=82.32s)]
*  different, 97% said yes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=84.52s)]
*  Okay, so that's a pretty good [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=87.4s)]
*  number. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=89.72s)]
*  So Dave, first, I did a debate with [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=90.68s)]
*  you about Israel, you and I were on [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=94.32s)]
*  the same side, it was against [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=97.6s)]
*  Dennis Prager and Batya Ungar [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=99.84s)]
*  Sargon, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=101.96s)]
*  And let's be honest, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=103.4s)]
*  we annihilated them, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=104.56s)]
*  Okay, and at that time, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=106.44s)]
*  you're pretty set against Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=108.08s)]
*  What made you vote for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=111.32s)]
*  Trump in the first place? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=112.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=113.32s)]
*  there were several factors. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  I thought, first of all, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  I should probably make clear that, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=118.0s)]
*  and this is something that's come [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=120.16s)]
*  up because I've seen the reaction [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=122.16s)]
*  to me saying I regret voting for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=124.08s)]
*  the guy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=126.0s)]
*  I'm a radical libertarian, and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=126.55999999999999s)]
*  I look at voting in a different way [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=128.76s)]
*  than I think a lot of other people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=131.16s)]
*  do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=133.64s)]
*  I don't look at voting as like [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=134.76s)]
*  a full endorsement of somebody in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=136.72s)]
*  every position that they have. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=139.04s)]
*  I, libertarians, and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=141.24s)]
*  I believe we're right about this, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  we view governments inherently as [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=144.88s)]
*  instruments of tyranny and force. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=147.32s)]
*  And that doesn't, by the way, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=150.0s)]
*  I'm not even saying some [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=151.68s)]
*  libertarians might argue, and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=153.0s)]
*  I would probably agree that there [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=154.88s)]
*  might be some legitimate functions [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=156.8s)]
*  that could be done by an instrument [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=158.88s)]
*  of tyranny and force. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=160.76s)]
*  But nonetheless, that is what they [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=162.2s)]
*  are by their very nature, and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=164.08s)]
*  I think that the people essentially [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=165.84s)]
*  are under duress by their government. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  And voting to me is a strategic [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=170.28s)]
*  option. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=172.64s)]
*  You could, as Walter Block, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=173.76s)]
*  who's a libertarian economist, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=175.24s)]
*  he used the example of if you were [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=177.2s)]
*  in a concentration camp and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=179.16s)]
*  they gave you a vote over who your [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=180.96s)]
*  guard is going to be. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  Now that doesn't mean that you [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=184.88s)]
*  endorse being in a concentration [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  camp or you endorse everything [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=187.96s)]
*  that this guard is going to do. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=189.48s)]
*  You're simply saying, I think this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  guard is going to be a little bit [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=193.16s)]
*  more just than that guard is. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=194.76s)]
*  Now, I supported Donald Trump for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=195.96s)]
*  several reasons. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=198.28s)]
*  Number one, I thought that it was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=200.2s)]
*  very important for [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=202.56s)]
*  the country that the Democrats take [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=203.84s)]
*  a loss. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=206.24s)]
*  I was very clear on this from [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=206.84s)]
*  the very beginning that I thought [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  this was the most important issue. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=209.6s)]
*  There was just, the Democrats to me [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=211.16s)]
*  had just gone so far on so [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=213.84s)]
*  many issues, even though [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=215.6s)]
*  Republicans were bad, I mean, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  Democrats were leading the charge [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=219.88s)]
*  on championing lockdowns and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=222.28s)]
*  vaccine mandates and just the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=224.4s)]
*  insane COVID hysteria, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=226.32s)]
*  the insane woke hysteria, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=228.04s)]
*  I think was like a neoliberal [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=229.8s)]
*  takeover of the left. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=231.84s)]
*  And the Democrats were in leading [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=233.24s)]
*  the push for that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  Then on top of that, there was the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=238.68s)]
*  war in Ukraine that they went all [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  in on while the Republicans were at [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=242.24s)]
*  least rhetorically substantially [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=244.24s)]
*  better than them on. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  Then they had a senile president [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=248.88000000000002s)]
*  who they lied to the American [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  people and told wasn't senile. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  Then they tried to, I mean, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  after denying, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=257.36s)]
*  after denying a primary, after [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=259.24s)]
*  rigging the previous two primaries, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=261.24s)]
*  they then wouldn't even let you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=263.68s)]
*  vote on the next substitute [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  candidate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you know all this stuff, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  Cenk, so I just thought this was so [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=269.32s)]
*  overwhelming they needed to lose. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  I thought it was an incredible blow [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=273.24s)]
*  to the corporate media. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  I think one that they'll never [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=276.92s)]
*  recover from was Donald Trump [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=278.32s)]
*  winning a second time and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=279.76s)]
*  kind of the podcast scene ushering [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  him in. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=282.76s)]
*  So I thought there were lots of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=283.72s)]
*  cultural issues and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=285.68s)]
*  bigger issues for the country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  I felt like Donald Trump winning [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=289.72s)]
*  would be better than Kamala Harris [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  winning. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  And then on top of that, I guess, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=294.24s)]
*  I reserved a little bit of hope [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=296.32s)]
*  that, hey, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=298.2s)]
*  things looked a little bit [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=299.0s)]
*  different this time. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=300.48s)]
*  He had Tulsi Gabbard and Bobby [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  Kennedy and a lot of these [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=303.88s)]
*  different figures. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=305.76s)]
*  Tucker Carlson had some influence [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=307.8s)]
*  on him who's really great on a lot [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=309.6s)]
*  of the foreign policy issues. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=311.32s)]
*  And Joe Rogan helped get him into [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  the White House, maybe he could [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=314.92s)]
*  have some influence. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=316.7s)]
*  It seemed to me that there were [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=318.08s)]
*  more possibilities with Donald [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  Trump for something positive [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=322.28s)]
*  happen. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=324.24s)]
*  And I would also add he had been [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  burned by the system in a unique [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  way. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=329.09999999999997s)]
*  And I thought maybe he would be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=329.9s)]
*  a little bit different this time [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  around. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=333.3s)]
*  And also he had been totally [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=333.98s)]
*  betrayed by Netanyahu after that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=335.58s)]
*  when Netanyahu came out and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=337.53999999999996s)]
*  congratulated Joe Biden for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=339.14s)]
*  winning the election before our [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=340.82s)]
*  media was even calling the election [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=342.74s)]
*  for Joe Biden. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=344.74s)]
*  So anyway, I thought maybe there's [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=346.26s)]
*  a shot he'd be a little bit better. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=348.58s)]
*  And I thought with all the factors, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=350.62s)]
*  I put in on I'm going to support [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  this guy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=355.18s)]
*  Yeah, so look, there's plenty that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=356.14s)]
*  I disagree with you on that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=358.02s)]
*  analysis and there's plenty I agree [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=359.4s)]
*  with you on that analysis. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  The Democrats did lie to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=362.65999999999997s)]
*  the country, Joe Biden was too old [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=363.78s)]
*  and it was absurd. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=365.58s)]
*  Corporate media did lie and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=366.86s)]
*  corporate media, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=368.08s)]
*  I love that they were defeated. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=368.86s)]
*  That's why that tweet that people [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=370.21999999999997s)]
*  found to be controversial, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=371.74s)]
*  I was not 1% happy that Donald Trump [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  won. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=375.06s)]
*  But I said after that he won, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  we were out of the establishment [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=377.46s)]
*  prison and in the populous woods. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=379.38s)]
*  And I prefer to be in the populous [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=381.42s)]
*  woods than in the establishment [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=382.86s)]
*  prison. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=384.26s)]
*  And that prison was set by [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=384.76s)]
*  corporate media, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=386.1s)]
*  mainstream media, etc. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=386.98s)]
*  And so now there's a jailbreak. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=388.54s)]
*  That's why we're in the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=389.82s)]
*  conversation we are about Iran. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=391.02s)]
*  They say, of course you have to go [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=392.86s)]
*  to war with Iran. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=394.46s)]
*  Who do you think you are? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=395.54s)]
*  No, if Israel commands us to go, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=396.98s)]
*  you must go, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=398.7s)]
*  But now independent media is saying [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=400.26s)]
*  no, and that's what we're [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=401.66s)]
*  united about. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=402.5s)]
*  That's what we're going to get to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=403.1s)]
*  in a second. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=404.18s)]
*  You did mention one thing there [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=404.7s)]
*  that drew my interest super quick [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=406.3s)]
*  because I really want to talk about [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=407.97999999999996s)]
*  the war. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=409.82s)]
*  But you said you're a radical [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=410.34s)]
*  libertarian, don't like [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=412.02s)]
*  the militarization, worried about [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=413.53999999999996s)]
*  the tyranny of government, etc. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=415.46s)]
*  So are you opposed to the Marines [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=417.3s)]
*  in LA? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=418.82s)]
*  Well, I mean, no, I think that's [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=420.74s)]
*  a little bit different of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=422.78s)]
*  a question. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=424.18s)]
*  And I don't, generally speaking, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=424.78s)]
*  I don't like the government doing [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=427.62s)]
*  anything and I don't like our [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=430.26s)]
*  government being so militarized. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=432.66s)]
*  I've been an opponent of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=435.94s)]
*  the militarization of the police [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=437.38s)]
*  for many years at this point. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=439.54s)]
*  I do think that there is, and look, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=442.9s)]
*  this could be a whole topic that we [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=445.38s)]
*  talk quite a lot about. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=447.82s)]
*  But the riots of 2020 and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=449.74s)]
*  things like that, I simply do not [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=452.18s)]
*  believe should be allowed to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=455.26s)]
*  happen. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=457.78s)]
*  And I also don't think that they're [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=458.3s)]
*  very organic in nature. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=460.14s)]
*  I think that there's big business [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=461.38s)]
*  behind a lot of these things and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=463.61999999999995s)]
*  big money behind a lot of these [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=465.61999999999995s)]
*  events. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=467.7s)]
*  And listen, when protests turn [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=468.46s)]
*  violent, I think that they do need [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=471.02s)]
*  to, that does need to be stopped [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=473.78s)]
*  and whatever that takes. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=476.14s)]
*  I'd prefer it doesn't take [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=478.14s)]
*  the military to do that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=479.73999999999995s)]
*  But I am not for violence in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  the street, I'm not for destroying [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=483.38s)]
*  people's property. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=486.26s)]
*  I mean, I thought it was an [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=488.26s)]

*  That we're society, we have this [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=491.53999999999996s)]
*  militarized police and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=493.46s)]
*  all of this stuff. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=494.82s)]
*  And the one time that there might [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=496.02s)]
*  be a legitimate need for it, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=497.7s)]
*  they just stand down and allow [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=499.14s)]
*  like dozens of people to be [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=500.74s)]
*  murdered and thousands to be [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=502.2s)]
*  assaulted and billions of dollars [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=503.7s)]
*  in property damage. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=505.7s)]
*  I mean, I think it's appalling. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=506.7s)]
*  I also think it's appalling when [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=509.09999999999997s)]
*  cops are spraying pepper spray into [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=510.94s)]
*  nonviolent protests and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=512.98s)]
*  things like that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=514.5s)]
*  But I don't have much tolerance for [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=515.74s)]
*  riots. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=518.38s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=519.62s)]
*  So neither do I, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=520.7800000000001s)]
*  I believe in nonviolence. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=521.5400000000001s)]
*  We're going to talk about that in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=522.7s)]
*  the context of the war protests in [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=524.14s)]
*  a minute. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=525.58s)]
*  But good because otherwise we've [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=526.1s)]
*  established that we really do [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=527.82s)]
*  disagree on other issues, right? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=529.38s)]
*  I think the Marines in LA is [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=531.7s)]
*  an abomination. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=533.1s)]
*  And I think you're totally wrong [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=534.14s)]
*  about that, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=535.74s)]
*  especially as a libertarian. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=536.4200000000001s)]
*  I think that, as you saw the 22 [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=538.1800000000001s)]
*  corporations that sponsored [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=540.1s)]
*  the military parade, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=541.9000000000001s)]
*  our military has gotten [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=543.14s)]
*  corporatized. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=544.38s)]
*  And so if you're worried about- [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=545.1400000000001s)]
*  I'm against the parade. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=546.58s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=547.9s)]
*  Yeah. So the US military in [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=548.9s)]
*  the streets is exactly the tyranny [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=550.3s)]
*  of government that you guys [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=552.06s)]
*  were worried about. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=553.5s)]
*  But okay, so [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=554.9s)]
*  we disagree on things, good. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=555.54s)]
*  Okay, now let's talk about things [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=557.5799999999999s)]
*  we agree on, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=559.02s)]
*  It's called being an American. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=560.1s)]
*  And I want everybody to know, and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=561.5s)]
*  these days, especially on the left, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=562.9s)]
*  I love you guys, okay? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=564.42s)]
*  But Americans are allowed to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=566.06s)]
*  disagree on different things and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=567.74s)]
*  agree on others. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=569.54s)]
*  I know it's a revolutionary [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=571.18s)]
*  thought, but [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=572.22s)]
*  we're doing a revolution here. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=572.74s)]
*  Okay, so you and I both agree we [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=574.34s)]
*  should not go into Iran. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=576.78s)]
*  But now, because of Donald Trump's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=579.9s)]
*  actions, you have now flipped on [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=582.38s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=584.78s)]
*  So you said the other day that you [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=585.98s)]
*  regret voting for Donald Trump. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=588.02s)]
*  You stick by that, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=590.26s)]
*  do you regret it? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=591.1800000000001s)]
*  And you said as far as, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=592.1s)]
*  you went as far as saying impeached, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=593.7s)]
*  you still believe that today, and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=596.3s)]
*  why? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=598.66s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=599.22s)]
*  I mean, look, at this point, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=601.14s)]
*  look, Cenk, with a lot of these [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=603.02s)]
*  things, it's, what do I have? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=605.0999999999999s)]
*  I don't have any power over actual [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=608.7399999999999s)]
*  government policy, but I have [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=610.78s)]
*  a little bit of an audience, and [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=612.66s)]
*  then I have an influence on some [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=614.4599999999999s)]
*  people who have audiences, and so [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=616.26s)]
*  I can have a little bit of influence [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=618.18s)]
*  on a broader conversation. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=620.18s)]
*  And what else can you do when [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=621.9s)]
*  the President of the United States [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=623.66s)]
*  is leading us into the most [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=625.8599999999999s)]
*  disastrous policy imaginable, and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=627.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm on record having supported [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=629.8599999999999s)]
*  the guy? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=631.9s)]
*  What can I say other than, yeah, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=632.9799999999999s)]
*  I shouldn't have done that, and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=634.8199999999999s)]
*  this is terrible, and let me try in [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=636.66s)]
*  my little part to rally as many [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=638.78s)]
*  people that I can to give pushback [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=640.78s)]
*  to this, and not due to my [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=643.06s)]
*  influence, but just in a very good [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=644.9s)]
*  turn of events, and because some [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=647.3s)]
*  people have shown real integrity, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=649.62s)]
*  and also because I think there's [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=652.14s)]
*  a certain desire amongst the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=654.5s)]
*  people. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=656.5799999999999s)]
*  But we've seen a lot of very [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=657.26s)]
*  influential MAGA figures really [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=659.38s)]
*  say that they will not put up with [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=661.98s)]
*  this, and they will not support [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=664.34s)]
*  this, and I think that's something [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=666.7s)]
*  that should be celebrated by [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=669.3000000000001s)]
*  everybody who is against the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  absolute catastrophe that a further [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=673.62s)]
*  escalating war in Iran would be. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=676.3800000000001s)]
*  And look, it's not as if Donald [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=678.7800000000001s)]
*  Trump doesn't have to run for [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=680.98s)]
*  reelection, he does have midterms [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=683.1s)]
*  coming up, and he does need his [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=685.7s)]
*  coalition to some degree in order [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=687.9000000000001s)]
*  to get his agenda through. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=690.26s)]
*  But the only thing that many of us [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=692.18s)]
*  can do at this point is try our [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=694.62s)]
*  best to create a situation where [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=696.8s)]
*  there will be a cost to be paid [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=699.18s)]
*  for him doing this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=701.3s)]
*  And so I think that it's been [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=703.14s)]
*  pretty clear, I mean, look, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=704.78s)]
*  it's pretty remarkable, forget me, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=706.48s)]
*  but figures like Tucker Carlson, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=708.8199999999999s)]
*  Steve Bannon, Charlie Kirk are all [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=710.98s)]
*  out there right now saying, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=713.3s)]
*  you will destroy your coalition if [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=715.06s)]
*  you do this. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=717.3s)]
*  You will absolutely split MAGA into [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=718.98s)]
*  a civil war against each other. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=721.26s)]
*  And so that is, if you think about [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=723.54s)]
*  it in the game of politics, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=726.1s)]
*  a huge cost to be imposed on [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=728.32s)]
*  somebody. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  And so right in this very prescient [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=732.74s)]
*  moment, the fact that that cost is [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=734.62s)]
*  being imposed, I think, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=736.46s)]
*  is a great thing. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=737.74s)]
*  And if I can play any part in that, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=738.82s)]
*  then I'm happy to do it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=740.78s)]
*  And also, Cenk, is something that [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=742.1s)]
*  I think me and you kind of have in [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=744.34s)]
*  common, I don't know, man, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=746.38s)]
*  when I get on these shows and [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=748.02s)]
*  I start talking, I'm just going to [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=749.36s)]
*  say what I think is true. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=750.94s)]
*  And so I got, I didn't even really [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=752.1s)]
*  plan out that I was going to say on [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=753.94s)]
*  breaking points the other day, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=755.54s)]
*  like I regret supporting him and [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=757.1s)]
*  he should be impeached or whatever. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=758.7s)]
*  It was just like, I mean, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=760.82s)]
*  I kind of knew it might happen, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=762.1s)]
*  because that's how I felt. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=763.54s)]
*  But then I just started talking to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=764.82s)]
*  Sager and Crystal and [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=766.9s)]
*  that's how I feel. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=768.34s)]
*  And why should he be impeached and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=769.9s)]
*  removed? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=772.78s)]
*  I mean, come on, it's so obvious. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=773.58s)]
*  I mean, he's essentially saying, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=776.66s)]
*  and I don't know what the real [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=778.42s)]
*  story is here, because there's [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=779.86s)]
*  conflicting reports. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=781.34s)]
*  But it doesn't matter, because he's [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=782.42s)]
*  saying it either way, that he was [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=784.14s)]
*  negotiating with Iran to sucker [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=785.92s)]
*  them, to distract them, so [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=787.74s)]
*  Israel could launch a sneak Pearl [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=789.32s)]
*  Harbor attack, a completely illegal, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=791.38s)]
*  aggressive attack against [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=793.9s)]
*  a sovereign nation. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=795.64s)]
*  Come on, you're going to impeach [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=797.62s)]
*  somebody over a phone call with [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=800.02s)]
*  Zelensky, where he maybe tried to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=802.1800000000001s)]
*  suggest that there should be [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=805.74s)]
*  a quid pro quo, which he never even [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=807.6600000000001s)]
*  got and then caved, never even got [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=810.1s)]
*  the investigation on Biden and [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=812.38s)]
*  still sent the weapons package in [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=814.34s)]
*  anyway, that's impeachable. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=816.5s)]
*  January 6th is impeachable, but [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=818.7s)]
*  leading us into the seventh [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=820.86s)]
*  absolutely disastrous regime change [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=822.6600000000001s)]
*  war of choice on behalf of [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=825.22s)]
*  a foreign nation. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=826.82s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, Jake, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=828.3000000000001s)]
*  I've heard it said before, I don't [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=829.62s)]
*  know who remember who coined the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=831.2600000000001s)]
*  phrase, but an impeachable offense [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=832.86s)]
*  that decides, well, okay, well, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=834.62s)]
*  if our Congress wasn't a bunch of [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=836.42s)]
*  hack, corrupt, blood soaked [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=838.14s)]
*  monsters, this seems like maybe [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=839.66s)]
*  something they should pick. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=841.34s)]
*  Maybe this should be the thing that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=842.7s)]
*  you impeach a president over. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=844.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=846.38s)]
*  Worse than having an affair and [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=847.0600000000001s)]
*  lying about it, that's for sure. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=849.02s)]
*  Yeah, and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=851.86s)]
*  unquestionable about that. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=852.42s)]
*  So let's see if we can unite [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=854.0600000000001s)]
*  the country against this war. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=855.34s)]
*  So we're starting with [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=856.82s)]
*  progressives and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=858.3s)]
*  libertarians here, right? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=859.34s)]
*  So, Dave, I came up with an idea, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=861.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to run it by you, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=863.5s)]
*  you're the first person I'm [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=865.22s)]
*  running it by. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=866.86s)]
*  Let's see if we can get agreement [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=867.7s)]
*  on it and see what we can do going [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=869.1800000000001s)]
*  forward, right? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=870.58s)]
*  The idea is called [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=871.58s)]
*  operation consequences. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=872.7800000000001s)]
*  And so the first step was going to [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=874.58s)]
*  be having us pick champions for [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=877.0600000000001s)]
*  our side and have them introduce [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=879.5s)]
*  the War Power Resolution Act, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=882.0600000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=884.6600000000001s)]
*  And good news, since they're our [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=885.58s)]
*  champions, they already did it [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=887.26s)]
*  without us asking, okay? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=888.82s)]
*  So my guess is you would have [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=890.3000000000001s)]
*  picked Thomas Massey, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=891.5400000000001s)]
*  I would have picked Bernie Sanders [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=892.9399999999999s)]
*  and Thomas Massey and [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=894.62s)]
*  Bernie Sanders have introduced [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=895.5s)]
*  legislation to bring the power of [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=897.14s)]
*  war back to Congress, which is [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=899.06s)]
*  where the Constitution has, right? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=900.8199999999999s)]
*  So let's get back to our [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=903.38s)]
*  constitutional system, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=904.78s)]
*  let's get back to war. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=906.26s)]
*  So step one's already done, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=907.5s)]
*  because that's what champions [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=909.14s)]
*  are made of, right? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=910.86s)]
*  So, okay, step two is a pledge [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=912.26s)]
*  that if anybody votes yes on [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=915.4599999999999s)]
*  this resolution, that we never vote [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=918.54s)]
*  for them again, ever, ever, ever, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=922.18s)]
*  okay? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=925.2199999999999s)]
*  You can tell me you're great on [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=926.2199999999999s)]
*  every other issue, and [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=927.6999999999999s)]
*  I can really like you, but you vote [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=928.8599999999999s)]
*  yes on this war, and [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=930.4599999999999s)]
*  we're done with you forever. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=931.4599999999999s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=933.2199999999999s)]
*  100%, yes. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=934.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so we set up a site, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=936.5s)]
*  it's like it just directs back to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=938.18s)]
*  a pledge. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=940.3s)]
*  We're going to do more and [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=941.3s)]
*  more as we go along, but [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=942.42s)]
*  the pledge is to never vote for [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=943.5s)]
*  anyone who voted yes on this war. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=944.9399999999999s)]
*  And it's called [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=947.3s)]
*  unitedagainstwar.com, and [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=947.9s)]
*  we'll have the link down below, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=949.2199999999999s)]
*  unitedagainstwar.com. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=950.78s)]
*  Okay, so now, here's the reason to [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=952.3s)]
*  do a pledge. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=955.0999999999999s)]
*  If it turns out, Dave, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=957.14s)]
*  that it's just me and you, and [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=958.3399999999999s)]
*  we ask our audience, you ask your [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=959.9s)]
*  audience, I'm part of the problem. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=961.5s)]
*  We both talk about it in all [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=963.18s)]
*  the shows we go on, but we just [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=964.38s)]
*  can't get to like a million people [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=965.8599999999999s)]
*  that signed the pledge. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=967.54s)]
*  People aren't going to take it [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=969.38s)]
*  seriously, 12,000 people, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=970.3s)]
*  that's nice, but [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=971.42s)]
*  it's not going to work, right? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=972.06s)]
*  And maybe, Dave, what we wind up [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=973.9799999999999s)]
*  doing is Al Capone's vault here. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=975.5799999999999s)]
*  Like you remember, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=978.06s)]
*  Geraldo made a big deal about it, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=978.6999999999999s)]
*  hyped it up. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=979.9s)]
*  And then it turns out there wasn't [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=981.22s)]
*  anything in it, right? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=982.46s)]
*  But if you get to a million or [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=984.38s)]
*  2 million voters who say they will [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=986.26s)]
*  never vote for someone who [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=988.46s)]
*  votes for this war, or [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=990.1s)]
*  you get to 5 million. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=991.58s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, a little bit [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=993.62s)]
*  of concern starts to creep in, and [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=995.46s)]
*  mainstream media starts to go, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=997.58s)]
*  who are these rabble rousers? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=999.5s)]
*  And how dare they be against [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1001.38s)]
*  this war? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1002.9s)]
*  So now I'm going to get to the next [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1004.3s)]
*  steps in a second, but a mass of [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1006.5s)]
*  people promising, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1009.1800000000001s)]
*  like a new voting block, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1010.78s)]
*  totally divorced from the parties. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1012.5s)]
*  And this is really important. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1015.14s)]
*  Dave, what I'm saying is, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1016.7s)]
*  do it in your primaries. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1018.0600000000001s)]
*  So nobody's doing unilateral [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1019.7s)]
*  surrender to the other side, right? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1021.1s)]
*  So if a Democrat votes for [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1023.22s)]
*  this war, you must go vote in [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1024.5s)]
*  a primary against them, right? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1026.02s)]
*  And if a Republican votes for [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1028.58s)]
*  this war, same thing, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1029.7s)]
*  go in a Republican primary and [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1030.42s)]
*  vote against them. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1031.7s)]
*  Does that part make sense? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1032.5s)]
*  Sure, absolutely. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1034.78s)]
*  Yeah, so now, the most important [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1036.3s)]
*  part is the actual accountability, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1039.3s)]
*  right? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1042.6599999999999s)]
*  And that has two phases. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1044.46s)]
*  So first part of the accountability [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1046.18s)]
*  is, I hope we get volunteers. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1048.18s)]
*  We do Operation Hope, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1050.7s)]
*  tyt.com slash hope. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1051.6599999999999s)]
*  But you can volunteer in any way, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1053.18s)]
*  shape, or form, or [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1054.22s)]
*  you don't have to volunteer, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1054.74s)]
*  you can just do it on your own, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1055.46s)]
*  right? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1056.3799999999999s)]
*  Find your local congressman, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1057.02s)]
*  find your senator, and [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1058.26s)]
*  just ask them, right? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1059.5s)]
*  You'd be shocked at how easy it is. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1060.78s)]
*  Just Google it, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1062.4199999999998s)]
*  find out who they are, email or [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1063.3s)]
*  phone, and ask them, are you in [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1065.42s)]
*  favor of the war powers resolution? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1067.5s)]
*  And Dave, what's great about [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1070.14s)]
*  this resolution is, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1071.74s)]
*  the President can't veto it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1072.78s)]
*  It's a congressional power in [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1074.5800000000002s)]
*  the Constitution, right? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1076.26s)]
*  And they must vote on it in 15 days. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1077.8600000000001s)]
*  So it sits in committee usually for [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1081.3000000000002s)]
*  15 days, and it's a privileged bill. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1083.6200000000001s)]
*  So it's going to get a vote, and [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1086.18s)]
*  everyone's going to go on the [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1088.0600000000002s)]
*  record. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1089.7s)]
*  That is why pressuring people to, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1090.5s)]
*  and basically what you're doing, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1093.3s)]
*  Dave, is a public service [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1096.22s)]
*  announcement to your members of [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1098.22s)]
*  Congress, to your representatives. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1100.8600000000001s)]
*  Hey guys, just know that if you [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1103.78s)]
*  vote yes, we're going to vote [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1105.22s)]
*  against you the rest of our lives. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1106.5s)]
*  I'm just letting you know, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1108.14s)]
*  you can do whatever you want with [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1109.1s)]
*  that information. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1110.22s)]
*  I know you're going to get a check. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1111.1s)]
*  I know you're going to get a check [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1112.58s)]
*  from AIPAC to vote yes, right? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1113.94s)]
*  But it's going to cost you this [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1115.7s)]
*  number of votes. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1117.1s)]
*  Again, does that seem logical to [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1119.06s)]
*  you? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1120.66s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1122.0400000000002s)]
*  All of this is the most obvious and [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1122.8000000000002s)]
*  logical stuff. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1124.72s)]
*  I'm thrilled that you're putting it [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1126.0400000000002s)]
*  together like this. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1127.68s)]
*  All right, unitedagainstwar.com. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1128.8000000000002s)]
*  So finally, the last part is [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1130.28s)]
*  the part where, and [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1132.64s)]
*  I'm asking you like genuinely, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1134.3200000000002s)]
*  what do we think? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1136.76s)]
*  Is it going to happen? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1138.24s)]
*  Are people going to rise up? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1139.24s)]
*  Or are they going to go back to [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1140.96s)]
*  tribalism? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1142.16s)]
*  And they're just going to go, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1143.2s)]
*  well, no, I mean, I don't want to [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1144.68s)]
*  say no because of Trump and [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1146.28s)]
*  because my party. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1147.76s)]
*  But the Democrats leadership says [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1149.48s)]
*  we should vote yes, blah, blah, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1151.56s)]
*  blah. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1153.64s)]
*  Or are there going to be real [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1154.16s)]
*  consequences? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1155.88s)]
*  Are the American people going to [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1157.3600000000001s)]
*  rise up enough that we cost them [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1159.48s)]
*  a bunch of seats? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1161.44s)]
*  And totally not related to [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1163.16s)]
*  anything partisan. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1164.68s)]
*  No, this is just a voting block on [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1165.96s)]
*  a single issue. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1167.8s)]
*  It's direct democracy. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1168.92s)]
*  You vote this way and you're done. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1170.88s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1173.3200000000002s)]
*  Does it have a prayer of working? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1173.88s)]
*  All right, so this is interesting. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1177.08s)]
*  And I always want to be a little [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1180.1999999999998s)]
*  bit humble when I'm predicting [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1182.56s)]
*  what's going to happen next. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1184.84s)]
*  Because predicting the future is [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1186.84s)]
*  always a tough business. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1189.0s)]
*  And there's some sometimes things [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1190.6s)]
*  will be so obvious that you could [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1192.6399999999999s)]
*  predict like, hey, if you shut down [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1194.4399999999998s)]
*  the economy and print $6 trillion, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1196.56s)]
*  that's going to have some negative [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1198.8s)]
*  impacts on the economy. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1200.7199999999998s)]
*  Okay, there's some things you can [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1202.08s)]
*  predict, but there's some things [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1203.6799999999998s)]
*  that are tougher and [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1205.32s)]
*  there's a lot going on here and [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1206.3999999999999s)]
*  we don't know everything. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1208.12s)]
*  I'll say this, the Hawks right now [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1210.0s)]
*  are celebrating the success of this [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1214.32s)]
*  war five days into it. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1218.2s)]
*  That's always the case. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1223.6399999999999s)]
*  They always celebrate it right away. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1224.8s)]
*  They always, every single war of my [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1226.12s)]
*  lifetime, they're bragging about it [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1227.6799999999998s)]
*  as soon as it starts. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1229.28s)]
*  It's not till it goes bad that they [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1230.24s)]
*  start admitting the truth, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1232.08s)]
*  if they ever do. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1233.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe there is some chance. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1235.96s)]
*  I've heard it argued that Iran is [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1239.72s)]
*  a better candidate for [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1242.0s)]
*  regime change than Iraq or Libya or [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1243.48s)]
*  Syria or Yemen or any of these other [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1245.84s)]
*  regime change arenas of Afghanistan [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1248.2s)]
*  that we've seen in the last 25 [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1250.6s)]
*  years. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe there is some sliver of [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1255.24s)]
*  a chance that the regime gets [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1257.4399999999998s)]
*  overthrown and it's not the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1259.76s)]
*  catastrophe that it was in all of [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1261.9199999999998s)]
*  these other areas. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1264.36s)]
*  I find this to be very hard to [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1265.3999999999999s)]
*  believe but just with the caveat [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1267.04s)]
*  that maybe there's some chance that [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1268.9199999999998s)]
*  it goes that way. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1270.9599999999998s)]
*  It seems much, much, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1272.04s)]
*  much more likely that it's going to [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1273.3999999999999s)]
*  be exactly what the other six [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1275.56s)]
*  countries in Wesley Clark's seven [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1277.4799999999998s)]

*  catastrophe. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1283.6s)]
*  I think at this point, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1284.9199999999998s)]
*  they're in a regime change war. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1286.52s)]
*  And I don't know, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1289.32s)]
*  I think it's worth trying to stop [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1290.36s)]
*  it, it's worth trying to [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1292.4799999999998s)]
*  impose as big a cost on the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1294.26s)]
*  politicians in charge if they [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1295.86s)]
*  actually do go through with this. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1297.74s)]
*  But it seems like they've already [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1300.78s)]
*  launched a regime change war. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1302.3s)]
*  As me and you both know Cenk, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1303.58s)]
*  this was never about a nuclear [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1305.18s)]

*  deterrent, essentially. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1313.18s)]
*  They want to just let you know that [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1315.18s)]
*  they could enrich up to a high [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1317.66s)]
*  enough level to have nuclear [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1319.62s)]
*  weapons so you don't do what you [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1321.54s)]
*  don't do what's already happened [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1323.82s)]
*  to them. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1325.82s)]
*  Everybody involved knows that, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1326.3799999999999s)]
*  including Netanyahu who's lying [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1328.1399999999999s)]
*  through his teeth about that. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1329.82s)]
*  He doesn't really think Iran's [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1331.3s)]
*  been three years away from a bomb [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1333.26s)]
*  for 30 years, you know what I mean? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1335.08s)]
*  He knows, and so [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1337.26s)]
*  they're in a regime change war. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1338.02s)]
*  This has been their goal the whole [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1339.3799999999999s)]
*  time, Donald Trump has signed off [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1341.06s)]
*  on it, he's backing it up. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1342.86s)]
*  The question now is, if that is [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1344.4199999999998s)]
*  the case and they go through with [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1347.78s)]
*  it, okay, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1350.8999999999999s)]
*  there's a couple major questions. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1351.86s)]
*  Number one is, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1353.02s)]
*  what can Iran actually get off? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1353.9399999999998s)]
*  And I don't know that that's [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1356.4199999999998s)]
*  completely clear. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1357.6599999999999s)]
*  I know that back in 2007, 2008, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1358.7s)]
*  even the Pentagon was saying we [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1360.7s)]
*  can't go to war with Iran because [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1362.46s)]
*  they can touch all of our bases and [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1364.22s)]
*  all of our embassies. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1366.06s)]
*  They can touch Israel, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1367.34s)]
*  they can really inflict real [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1368.3799999999999s)]
*  damage. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1369.58s)]
*  This isn't like the other puny [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1370.1s)]
*  countries we were picking on in [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1371.3799999999999s)]
*  the terror wars. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1372.62s)]
*  Maybe things have changed a little [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1373.5s)]
*  bit since then, maybe the [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1375.02s)]
*  technology and that certainly [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1376.06s)]
*  Israel's drone strike there was [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1377.3799999999999s)]
*  something they couldn't have [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1378.6599999999999s)]
*  pulled off years ago. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1379.8999999999999s)]
*  But I think the real question to [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1381.3s)]
*  get at the heart of what you're [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1383.1s)]
*  talking about here is, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1384.8999999999999s)]
*  9-11 happened in September of 2001. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1386.36s)]
*  We invaded Iraq in 2003. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1389.8999999999999s)]
*  They spent all of 2002 laying out [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1393.3s)]
*  this propaganda, this cover that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1396.3s)]
*  was somewhat believable in [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1399.3799999999999s)]
*  the wake of 9-11. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1401.5s)]
*  It was like, hey, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1403.1s)]
*  9-11 just happened, there's this [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1404.34s)]
*  rogue Arab regime that it was in on [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1407.02s)]
*  9-11 and is friends with [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1409.98s)]
*  the terrorists and he's developing [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1411.6200000000001s)]
*  nuclear weapons or has nuclear [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1413.98s)]
*  weapons and he's going to hand them [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1415.9s)]
*  off to the terrorists and [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1417.9s)]
*  then Al Qaeda is going to nuke [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1419.3400000000001s)]
*  Kansas because Saddam Hussein gave [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1421.0600000000002s)]
*  him the, okay, now look, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1423.18s)]
*  obviously it was all, sorry, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1424.6200000000001s)]
*  obviously none of it was true. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1426.38s)]
*  And these were not Saddam Hussein's [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1428.3000000000002s)]
*  friends and he didn't have [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1431.02s)]
*  the weapons, but at least there was [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1432.98s)]
*  a cover story there. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1435.5400000000002s)]
*  Here there is no cover story. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1437.18s)]
*  This is just clearly Israel's war [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1440.26s)]
*  and also they don't have control [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1442.46s)]
*  of the media in the way they used [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1444.6599999999999s)]
*  to, they don't have control [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1446.78s)]
*  of the narrative. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1448.5s)]
*  And so with guys like me and you [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1449.82s)]
*  and hundreds more like us who are [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1451.78s)]
*  all going to be telling the truth [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1453.9399999999998s)]
*  about this to pretty big audiences, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1456.02s)]
*  I don't see how all of that works. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1458.58s)]
*  And if we really are entering this [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1461.3s)]
*  phase, we're entering a new phase [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1463.58s)]
*  in America, as much as we were in [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1465.86s)]
*  March of 2020, maybe even more so. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1468.18s)]
*  This dynamic cannot stand. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1470.9s)]
*  They can't have all of us telling [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1474.5s)]
*  the truth while they haven't even [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1476.38s)]
*  laid out a propaganda campaign if [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1478.38s)]
*  they're launching another regime [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1480.3400000000001s)]
*  change war, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1482.3400000000001s)]
*  it just simply can't work. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1482.94s)]
*  I don't know if they're going to [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1484.74s)]
*  try to silence us, if they're [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1486.26s)]
*  really going to weaponize the law [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1487.7800000000002s)]
*  against us, or if they're just [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1489.42s)]
*  going to fail at their mission or [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1490.94s)]
*  there'll be a revolt. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1492.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't know what the answer is, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1493.9s)]
*  but I'm telling you with all these [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1495.46s)]
*  guys on the ground, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1497.1s)]
*  this doesn't work. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1498.34s)]
*  And so we will see, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1500.1799999999998s)]
*  we're in a whole new time right [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1501.5s)]
*  now, maybe I'm wrong, maybe cooler [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1503.58s)]
*  heads will prevail here, maybe [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1505.86s)]
*  they will go back to [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1507.78s)]
*  the negotiating table. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1508.98s)]
*  But I got to tell you, Cenk, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1510.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1511.9399999999998s)]
*  I mean, every signal is that this [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1512.74s)]
*  regime change is going through. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1514.82s)]
*  And so again, I support doing [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1517.2199999999998s)]
*  everything we can to stop it, but [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1518.82s)]
*  I don't know what happens in [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1520.6599999999999s)]
*  the next chapter of this. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1522.1399999999999s)]
*  But it's going to be interesting. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1523.54s)]
*  So let's talk about the upsides [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1525.14s)]
*  that you mentioned and downsides. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1526.6200000000001s)]
*  So is it true that it's [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1528.18s)]
*  a regime change war? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1529.3000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely, and notice how quickly [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1530.6200000000001s)]
*  they move the goalposts, right? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1532.42s)]
*  Because they started with [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1534.18s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1535.7s)]
*  They're about to have nukes. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1537.66s)]
*  Then instantly, Netanyahu goes on [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1539.46s)]
*  Fox News, Brett Baer asks them about [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1541.3000000000002s)]
*  it, they weren't going to get it [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1543.1000000000001s)]
*  for a whole year anyway. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1544.66s)]
*  Okay, and I'm going to play you a [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1545.94s)]
*  Netanyahu clip if you haven't seen [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1547.38s)]
*  it yet, Daily Show put it together, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1548.9s)]
*  I love it, to show you what [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1550.5800000000002s)]
*  a giant, giant liar he is. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1551.98s)]
*  But I don't want people to lose [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1554.14s)]
*  focus. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1555.74s)]
*  I think what Dave was saying about [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1556.5800000000002s)]
*  independent media, well, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1558.0600000000002s)]
*  we're going to test it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1559.26s)]
*  This is the beginning, this is [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1560.14s)]
*  the very first day of us testing [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1561.5400000000002s)]
*  the power of independent media, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1562.98s)]
*  okay? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1564.5400000000002s)]
*  So I want to come back and [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1565.5s)]
*  talk about that in a second. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1566.38s)]
*  But I want to bring up that [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1567.3400000000001s)]

*  a nuclear weapon in a very short [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1597.22s)]

*  it. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1610.54s)]

*  Ladies and gentlemen, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1631.9s)]
*  time is running out. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1633.42s)]
*  Iran will be capable of producing [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1635.46s)]
*  a loan without importing anything, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1637.46s)]

*  five years. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1641.38s)]
*  Okay, so I'm going to get back to [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1644.18s)]
*  how we're going to fix this, but [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1646.46s)]
*  in the 2006 clip, he said that they [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1648.9s)]
*  could produce 250 nuclear warheads [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1651.5s)]
*  in a decade. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1654.2600000000002s)]
*  It's been basically two decades [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1655.74s)]
*  since then, so do they have 500 [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1657.9s)]
*  nuclear warheads? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1660.1000000000001s)]
*  And Dave, the question I want to [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1662.14s)]
*  ask you, I know, look, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1663.46s)]
*  this is a layup, but really, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1664.3000000000002s)]
*  if you're, I've lost every ounce of [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1665.74s)]
*  respect for mainstream media. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1667.9s)]
*  How do you look at a clip like [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1670.78s)]
*  that and then quote Netanyahu as if [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1672.58s)]
*  he might be telling the truth the [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1674.9399999999998s)]
*  very next day in your broadcast? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1677.1799999999998s)]
*  So what are they supposed, like me, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1680.1s)]
*  I would say Netanyahu is a giant [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1682.7s)]
*  liar and no one should ever trust [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1684.98s)]
*  a word that comes out of his mouth. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1687.3s)]
*  But mainstream media reporters will [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1690.06s)]
*  say, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1692.1799999999998s)]
*  Not only beloved Israel and [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1694.26s)]
*  you have to believe him more than [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1695.6599999999999s)]
*  the terrorist Muslims, right? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1697.1s)]
*  But at a bare minimum, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1698.98s)]
*  they'll say 50-50. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1700.66s)]
*  But Dave, it's not 50-50, is it? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1702.5s)]
*  He's been trying to drag us into [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1704.94s)]
*  this war for 33 straight years. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1706.82s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why this is [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1708.8600000000001s)]
*  just reminding me of this, but so [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1711.06s)]
*  I did a debate at Princeton [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1713.58s)]
*  University against Josh Hammer, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1715.6200000000001s)]
*  who is a senior editor at Newsweek. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1718.3400000000001s)]
*  And it was an Oxford style debate [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1721.18s)]
*  and I smoked him, but [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1724.02s)]
*  that's neither here nor there. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1726.06s)]
*  But he at one point, this was like [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1729.8999999999999s)]
*  his big moment in the debate, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1732.1399999999999s)]
*  is he turned over to me in the [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1734.1399999999999s)]
*  question and answer segment and [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1735.86s)]
*  he goes, hey, Dave, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1737.94s)]
*  who do you trust more, Osama bin [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1739.34s)]
*  Laden or Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1741.4199999999998s)]
*  And I responded by saying I don't [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1743.6599999999999s)]
*  trust either of them. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1746.06s)]
*  And he was like, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1747.58s)]
*  I think that speaks volumes. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1749.06s)]
*  It was something so messed up that [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1751.54s)]
*  I was like, I don't trust you, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1753.62s)]
*  I don't trust either of those guys. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1755.46s)]
*  But it's so funny because it's like [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1757.7s)]
*  you look at this and you're like, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1759.78s)]
*  yeah, you trust this guy? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1762.0s)]
*  This guy, he's clearly, I'm sorry, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1763.66s)]
*  this is not somebody getting it [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1765.98s)]
*  wrong, this is somebody lying [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1767.94s)]
*  through their teeth. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1769.8600000000001s)]
*  He knows that Iran doesn't have [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1771.3000000000002s)]
*  nuclear weapons, he knows that. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1773.22s)]
*  You think he thought in the 90s [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1775.1000000000001s)]
*  that they were going to develop [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1776.8600000000001s)]
*  hundreds of nuclear warheads? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1778.5s)]
*  It's so ridiculous. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1780.38s)]
*  And so the thing is that, and [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1782.14s)]
*  of course, Cenk, you know, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1783.54s)]
*  because you've been in this [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1784.8999999999999s)]
*  position so many times, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1786.1s)]
*  I've seen you there. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1787.02s)]
*  Well, they'll go, so [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1788.1s)]
*  what are you saying? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1788.9399999999998s)]
*  You support Hamas or [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1789.7s)]
*  you support Iran or [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1790.7s)]
*  you support whoever. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1791.7s)]
*  And it's like, look, I'm not [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1793.06s)]
*  saying, the thing isn't that I [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1794.8999999999999s)]
*  trust Osama bin Laden more than [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1796.8999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu because I think he's a [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1798.86s)]
*  good person or something like that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1801.02s)]
*  It's just that Osama bin Laden is [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1803.9399999999998s)]
*  a fanatic who declared war against [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1806.3799999999999s)]
*  the American Empire. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1809.1s)]
*  He has no incentive to lie about [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1811.1s)]
*  that. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1813.5s)]
*  He's telling you, if you look out [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1814.02s)]
*  your window at night and you see a [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1816.42s)]
*  guy with a bloody knife and he's [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1818.94s)]
*  like, I'm going to come in there [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1821.3000000000002s)]
*  and kill you, you're going to take [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1823.6200000000001s)]
*  him at his word. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1826.14s)]
*  I think that is what he's trying [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1827.3000000000002s)]
*  to do. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1828.7s)]
*  I'm not going to go, I don't, but [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1829.22s)]
*  Netanyahu is a politician who's [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1831.14s)]
*  trying to lure the US government [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1833.14s)]
*  into war after war after war. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1835.22s)]
*  So obviously he's incentivized to [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1837.26s)]
*  just lie and lie and lie. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1839.42s)]
*  And to your point, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1841.1000000000001s)]
*  it's not just that he should be [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1842.26s)]
*  treated as a liar. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1844.06s)]
*  He should be treated by the media [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1845.02s)]
*  and the entire US government as [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1847.1399999999999s)]
*  a hostile foreign combatant. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1849.2199999999998s)]
*  I mean, he is a representative of [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1851.58s)]
*  a foreign government trying to lie. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1854.1799999999998s)]

*  as I was saying, they start with [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1951.94s)]

*  just kidding, regime change. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1954.94s)]

*  their government. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1969.46s)]
*  But wait, you can kill the Ayatollah, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1969.98s)]
*  but to your point earlier, David, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1972.02s)]
*  they can just replace him with [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1973.5800000000002s)]
*  another mullah. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1974.7800000000002s)]
*  And if they do that, then they go [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1975.9s)]
*  and say, we're going to kill [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1977.14s)]
*  the next mullah, and then we've got [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1978.22s)]
*  to kill the next mullah. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1979.42s)]
*  You know what, this isn't working, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1980.22s)]
*  we got to get on the ground. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1981.42s)]
*  We're going to send a ground trip, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1982.26s)]
*  right? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1983.66s)]
*  Well, of course, and right, right, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1984.6200000000001s)]
*  and look, what's crazy is that you [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1986.5s)]
*  do see a lot of the same people who [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1988.26s)]
*  were selling the war in Iraq and [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1990.06s)]
*  Afghanistan and Libya and Syria and [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1991.78s)]
*  Somalia and Yemen and all of this. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1993.82s)]
*  You see them still trying to sell [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1996.06s)]
*  this one, and even look, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1997.98s)]
*  they'll tell you these things, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=1999.38s)]
*  they're trying to make it sound [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2001.02s)]
*  very nice. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2002.66s)]
*  Look, the people hate [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2003.18s)]
*  the government, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2004.22s)]
*  the people are celebrating. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2005.18s)]
*  By the way, they could find videos [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2006.74s)]
*  in Iraq and in Libya where people [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2008.38s)]
*  were celebrating. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2009.94s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people do hate that [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2010.98s)]
*  government. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2012.6200000000001s)]
*  That's not a guarantee of what's [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2013.7s)]
*  going to happen once that [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2015.3s)]
*  government falls. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2016.54s)]
*  That doesn't mean some type of like, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2017.3799999999999s)]
*  yeah, some type of liberalism is [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2019.62s)]
*  going to flourish or [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2021.7s)]
*  something like that. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2022.9s)]
*  And so it's easy for them to say, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2024.46s)]
*  the fact of the matter is that [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2027.06s)]
*  the Iranian regime, the mullahs, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2029.62s)]
*  have been in power since 1979. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2033.06s)]
*  And for most of that time, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2037.86s)]
*  they've had the most powerful [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2039.7s)]
*  governments in the world hell bent [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2041.98s)]
*  on overthrowing them and [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2044.78s)]
*  have still survived. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2046.5400000000002s)]
*  So the idea that this is just [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2048.58s)]
*  going to be easy to get rid of them [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2049.98s)]
*  or that the people hate them so [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2051.62s)]
*  much that they will overthrow them. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2053.26s)]
*  I think there's some reason to be [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2055.46s)]
*  skeptical about some of those [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2057.7000000000003s)]
*  claims. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2059.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's easy for [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2060.38s)]
*  these guys to celebrate at first. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2061.42s)]
*  They always do that. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2064.58s)]
*  And these things, they always [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2065.62s)]
*  celebrate at first and it always [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2067.62s)]
*  leads to absolute disaster. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2069.86s)]
*  Yeah, and so look, to your point, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2072.46s)]
*  there's a lot of people in Turkey [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2074.66s)]
*  that are very dissatisfied with [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2076.58s)]
*  the current Turkish government. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2078.46s)]
*  If we start bombing Turkey, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2080.42s)]
*  they'll fight us for [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2081.9s)]
*  500 years straight. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2082.7400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2084.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2084.9s)]
*  And I should just say to your [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2085.98s)]
*  point, I'm sorry to cut you off, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2087.1s)]
*  but to your point about the moving [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2088.58s)]
*  justifications for this war. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2090.3s)]
*  I mean, it's just unbelievable. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2092.66s)]
*  You're right to cite the parallel [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2095.46s)]
*  between that and like the war in [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2097.42s)]
*  Iraq and the war in Afghanistan and [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2099.3s)]
*  all this stuff. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2101.3s)]
*  They always move the goalposts in [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2102.2200000000003s)]
*  all these wars. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2104.34s)]
*  We're going into Iraq for [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2105.7400000000002s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2106.86s)]
*  But then it was to liberate [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2108.38s)]
*  the people. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2110.26s)]
*  And then we're going into Afghanistan [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2111.34s)]
*  to take out Al-Qaeda. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2113.54s)]
*  But then it was to overthrow [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2115.02s)]
*  the Taliban and [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2116.7000000000003s)]
*  then it was to nation build. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2117.6600000000003s)]
*  And it's always, but [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2119.6600000000003s)]
*  this one is it's so quick. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2121.02s)]
*  They're already, I was arguing with [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2122.98s)]
*  Dinesh D'Souza on Twitter today. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2124.94s)]
*  And he's like, look, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2126.94s)]
*  I supported the war in Iraq and [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2128.1400000000003s)]
*  I was wrong to support that. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2129.46s)]
*  I was like, yeah, but [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2130.94s)]
*  you're doing the exact same thing [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2131.58s)]
*  right now. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2132.6600000000003s)]
*  And then he goes, well, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2133.38s)]
*  this isn't the same as Iraq. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2134.58s)]
*  I mean, they said Saddam Hussein [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2136.06s)]
*  was in on 9-11, but [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2139.06s)]
*  Iran was in on October 7th. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2140.94s)]
*  And I was like, dude, first of all, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2143.86s)]
*  no, they weren't. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2147.26s)]
*  There's no evidence, but [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2148.1800000000003s)]
*  this is exactly the same. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2149.34s)]
*  Second of all, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2150.6200000000003s)]
*  that's not even the justification [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2151.2200000000003s)]
*  yet, dude. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2152.86s)]
*  You're jumping to the next [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2153.9s)]
*  justification already. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2155.06s)]
*  I thought it was that they had [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2156.42s)]
*  nuclear weapons or [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2157.58s)]
*  were developing nuclear weapons. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2158.34s)]
*  I've already seen several people [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2159.9s)]
*  arguing that it's about [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2162.34s)]
*  freeing the women. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2164.06s)]
*  They don't give their women rights [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2166.26s)]
*  and so that's what it's about. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2168.06s)]
*  They'll just switch, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2169.54s)]
*  once one justification falls apart, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2170.7400000000002s)]
*  they have to have the next one to [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2172.78s)]
*  move to. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2174.42s)]
*  And just for any of these, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2175.02s)]
*  first of all, it is nobody has [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2177.06s)]
*  presented any evidence. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2179.46s)]
*  And in fact, there's been evidence [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2181.82s)]
*  to the counter. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2183.78s)]
*  The US intelligence said that [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2184.82s)]
*  the Iranians were surprised by [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2186.58s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2188.54s)]
*  Now, you could argue that they have [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2189.46s)]
*  sold weapons to Hamas at one point [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2191.7400000000002s)]
*  in the past, or in fact, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2193.78s)]
*  I think they have. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2195.38s)]
*  I don't exactly know how much [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2196.7s)]
*  weapons they've sold to Hamas. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2198.1s)]
*  They've certainly sold weapons to [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2199.46s)]
*  Hezbollah and to the Houthis. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2201.38s)]
*  But regardless, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2203.02s)]
*  is that the standard now, Cenk? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2204.3s)]
*  That if you sell weapons to someone [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2206.58s)]
*  and they attack you, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2208.38s)]
*  you're guilty of the attack? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2209.58s)]
*  because by the way, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2211.38s)]
*  if that's the standard, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2212.18s)]
*  you don't want to go through what [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2213.38s)]
*  the US and Israel are guilty of. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2214.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2216.58s)]
*  We've sold weapons to half [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2217.2200000000003s)]
*  of the goddamn country, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2218.46s)]
*  the world, excuse me. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2220.18s)]
*  And so that justification [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2222.62s)]
*  completely falls apart. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2224.42s)]
*  But I will say, especially just [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2226.18s)]
*  because I'm on the young Turks, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2228.06s)]
*  I guess, that I think it is when [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2229.9s)]
*  they say the stuff about the [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2231.58s)]
*  feminist stuff, I think that is to [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2233.18s)]
*  try to get the liberals and [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2235.2200000000003s)]
*  leftists on like, hey, come on, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2236.78s)]
*  look at how oppressive this regime [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2238.7s)]
*  is to their women. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2240.58s)]
*  I mean, you believe in women's [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2241.7400000000002s)]
*  rights and all this stuff. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2243.3s)]
*  And look, there's no question that [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2244.7400000000002s)]
*  the regime in Iran is repressive to [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2247.18s)]
*  women, okay? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2249.46s)]
*  There's no question that Saddam [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2250.78s)]
*  Hussein was repressive to his [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2252.66s)]
*  people and [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2254.34s)]
*  Muammar Gaddafi was repressive to [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2255.02s)]
*  his people. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2257.02s)]
*  But the worst thing that ever [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2257.78s)]
*  happened to the people, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2259.58s)]
*  including the women of Iraq, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2261.22s)]
*  was George W Bush launching [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2263.14s)]
*  a war there. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2264.82s)]
*  And the worst thing that ever [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2265.82s)]
*  happened to the people, including [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2267.46s)]
*  the women in Libya, was Barack [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2269.54s)]
*  Obama and Hillary Clinton launching [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2271.3s)]
*  a war there. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2273.34s)]
*  And so, it's like you could sit [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2274.06s)]
*  here and tell me the story about [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2275.86s)]
*  how this government's unfair to [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2277.54s)]
*  its people and that we're going to [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2279.26s)]
*  go in there and overthrow them on [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2281.06s)]
*  behalf of them. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2282.82s)]
*  But every time you do it, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2283.7000000000003s)]
*  it ends up being the biggest [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2284.9s)]
*  nightmare for those very people [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2286.34s)]
*  that you're pretending to care [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2288.06s)]
*  about. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2289.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean- [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2290.5800000000004s)]
*  Reject all of that stuff. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2291.3s)]
*  Yeah, Israel and [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2293.38s)]
*  the neocons here in America as well [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2294.2200000000003s)]
*  are all saying, you're right, too. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2296.1400000000003s)]
*  We're going to liberate [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2298.5s)]
*  the women there. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2299.38s)]
*  Really? Because Israel liberated [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2300.38s)]
*  20,000 women in Gaza of their lives. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2302.94s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2306.7s)]
*  Right, they care so [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2307.5s)]
*  much about women, except all [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2308.14s)]
*  the women they murdered in Gaza. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2309.2999999999997s)]
*  So now you'll excuse me if I don't [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2311.4599999999996s)]
*  buy that load of BS. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2313.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay, so now back to the solution. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2315.8199999999997s)]
*  One more thing here at least, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2318.06s)]
*  well, actually two things. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2319.14s)]
*  So look, the way that I see this, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2320.02s)]
*  Dave, is it's the powerful against [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2323.3799999999997s)]
*  the rest of us, right? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2326.58s)]
*  There's a poll out today, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2328.62s)]
*  only 16% of Americans think the US [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2330.4599999999996s)]
*  should be involved in this war [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2333.1s)]
*  with Iran, 16%. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2335.22s)]
*  So that is a radical position, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2337.1s)]
*  right? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2338.8599999999997s)]
*  You're in a tiny, tiny minority if [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2339.62s)]
*  you think we should go to war in [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2341.66s)]
*  Iran. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2343.5s)]
*  Okay, now you have tons of [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2344.3799999999997s)]
*  independent media, if not most of [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2345.9399999999996s)]
*  independent media, online media [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2347.8999999999996s)]
*  podcasts, etc., saying don't go. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2349.8999999999996s)]
*  This is crazy, right? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2351.62s)]
*  Including a lot of the right wing [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2353.1s)]
*  media. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2354.62s)]
*  So, but mainstream media, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2355.58s)]
*  cheerleading. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2357.8999999999996s)]
*  Got the pom poms out, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2359.58s)]
*  we got the outfits back, and [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2361.14s)]
*  they're doing calisthenics getting [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2363.86s)]
*  ready for war, war, war, W-A-W, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2366.62s)]
*  W, okay, A-R, you get it. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2369.78s)]
*  Lindsey Graham is back out there [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2372.3s)]
*  going, war, we need more war, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2374.1s)]
*  right? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2375.94s)]
*  And all the politicians, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2376.82s)]
*  what I think 87% of Congress at [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2378.38s)]
*  least takes money from APEC. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2380.3s)]
*  So they're all like, war, war, war. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2382.02s)]
*  So they're in the radical 16%. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2385.42s)]
*  And I think most of that 16%, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2387.3s)]
*  honestly, are people who got [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2388.6600000000003s)]
*  brainwashed watching cable news, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2389.9s)]
*  because cable news loves war, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2391.42s)]
*  right? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2392.9s)]
*  So we all are kind of despondent [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2394.42s)]
*  because we think there's no way [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2397.94s)]
*  the 84% can beat the 16%, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2401.1400000000003s)]
*  because the 16% have all the power. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2404.1s)]
*  But to your point earlier, Dave, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2407.1800000000003s)]
*  I think it's a different day in [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2409.54s)]
*  America. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2411.78s)]
*  I think that mainstream media has [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2412.9s)]
*  lost a lot of power. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2414.6200000000003s)]
*  I think the reason that the number [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2416.1s)]
*  is at 16% is because people aren't [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2418.06s)]
*  watching the propaganda on cable [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2420.1s)]
*  news anymore. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2421.98s)]
*  And so they might find this a [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2423.3s)]
*  harder hill than they thought it [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2425.82s)]
*  was because of independent media. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2428.82s)]
*  So is there hope here that [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2431.42s)]
*  independent media can start [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2433.46s)]
*  the prairie fire of hope that we [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2435.86s)]
*  can actually defeat the powerful? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2438.58s)]
*  And that if enough of us band [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2441.98s)]
*  together left, right, and center, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2444.02s)]
*  and we say, hey, look, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2446.62s)]
*  maybe you win, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2448.3s)]
*  maybe you win your elections. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2449.38s)]
*  But millions of us are going to [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2451.42s)]
*  vote against you. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2453.38s)]
*  So just don't be surprised when we [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2454.98s)]
*  do, I don't want Jake Tapper [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2457.38s)]
*  writing a book later saying no one [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2459.58s)]
*  could have seen it coming, because [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2461.98s)]
*  we are going to come for you. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2464.34s)]
*  And so if we, you and I do a tour [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2466.14s)]
*  and we go do it and we start to [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2468.7400000000002s)]
*  bring in right wing allies if they [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2471.1s)]
*  exist, left wing allies, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2473.7400000000002s)]
*  I know left wing allies exist. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2475.94s)]
*  Whether they'll join in with [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2479.3s)]
*  is a different question, right? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2481.82s)]
*  But can we muster up enough [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2483.94s)]
*  momentum here for [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2485.82s)]
*  the 84% to win rather than the 16%? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2487.06s)]
*  Well, okay, so let me just say [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2491.34s)]
*  a couple, two things to that. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2493.02s)]
*  Okay, number one, because I've [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2494.86s)]
*  watched you kind of, I think you've [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2496.9s)]
*  probably become the most prominent [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2499.14s)]
*  figure in the country who's really [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2501.2599999999998s)]
*  been kind of launching, even before [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2503.3s)]
*  your very specific kind of [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2505.38s)]
*  targeted plan today. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2506.94s)]
*  But you've been really promoting [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2508.34s)]
*  the idea that we ought to coalition [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2510.42s)]
*  on this opposition to war. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2512.54s)]
*  And that it's too crazy for [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2514.7000000000003s)]
*  us to say that like, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2516.2200000000003s)]
*  he's an evil right winger or [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2517.46s)]
*  he's an evil left winger. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2518.94s)]
*  And I just completely agree with [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2520.42s)]
*  you on that. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2522.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'm a child of the Ron Paul [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2523.86s)]
*  revolution, as we like to call it [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2526.94s)]
*  back then. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2530.26s)]
*  And that was always his stance, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2532.38s)]
*  coalition with anybody who you [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2534.7000000000003s)]
*  agree on an issue. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2536.82s)]
*  Now look, I will admit that [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2538.02s)]
*  probably in general when it comes [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2539.9s)]
*  to coalitioning, everything's [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2542.14s)]
*  within reason, okay? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2544.86s)]
*  And I probably would not coalition [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2547.34s)]
*  with Lindsey Graham about lowering [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2550.18s)]
*  top marginal income tax rates, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2553.02s)]
*  even though we might agree on that [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2555.5s)]
*  issue. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2557.9s)]
*  I'm not going to coalition with [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2558.62s)]
*  Lindsey Graham because my [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2560.62s)]
*  agreements with him are so [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2562.38s)]
*  much more important, excuse me, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2564.1s)]
*  than this tiny agreement with him [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2566.42s)]
*  that I just wouldn't do that. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2568.6600000000003s)]
*  And he's so monstrous for [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2570.6600000000003s)]
*  the things that I don't like about [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2572.1800000000003s)]
*  him. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2574.1400000000003s)]
*  But this is an issue and [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2574.6400000000003s)]
*  I will say that I think particularly [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2576.02s)]
*  on the left, you do have this issue. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2578.38s)]
*  And part of this is, again, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2581.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying that there's not [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2583.06s)]
*  this issue on the right at all or [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2585.3s)]
*  that everyone on the left has it. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2587.5s)]
*  I just think it's more of [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2590.02s)]
*  an issue on the left. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2591.1400000000003s)]
*  And part of this is because, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2592.26s)]
*  culturally speaking, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2594.1400000000003s)]
*  the right has gotten beat up for [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2595.9399999999996s)]
*  many, many years. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2598.3799999999997s)]
*  The right is more happy to just [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2602.46s)]
*  have anybody on their side about [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2604.18s)]
*  any issue. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2606.02s)]
*  The left has had this major [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2606.8599999999997s)]
*  problem, and I think it's something [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2608.7s)]
*  that you've talked about it, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2610.8199999999997s)]
*  you and Anna, I've heard you kind [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2612.54s)]
*  of discussed this in the past, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2614.5s)]
*  that over kind of the last 15 [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2616.4199999999996s)]
*  years, the left was almost lured [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2618.46s)]
*  into this kind of cultural [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2620.8999999999996s)]
*  space where there was an inability [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2623.1s)]
*  to prioritize certain issues above [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2625.66s)]
*  other issues or ever have a hierarchy [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2628.4599999999996s)]
*  of outrages or say that, look, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2631.3399999999997s)]
*  this thing, while it's a little bit [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2633.7799999999997s)]
*  wrong, it's really not that [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2636.4599999999996s)]
*  important. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2638.66s)]
*  It's just not nearly as important [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2639.4199999999996s)]
*  as this. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2641.58s)]
*  And I watched this for years, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2642.18s)]
*  it really saddened me as somebody [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2644.02s)]
*  who's from the left. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2645.9399999999996s)]
*  And when I say from the left, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2647.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean in my soul, I'm from New [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2649.06s)]
*  York City, I'm from New York City, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2650.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm a Jewish kid of a single mom. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2653.58s)]
*  I'm just like, by my nature, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2656.1s)]
*  I'm not from a conservative [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2658.18s)]
*  background, these people are my [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2660.22s)]
*  people. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2662.98s)]
*  And I watched this happen, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2664.54s)]
*  it was very saddening to me. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2666.46s)]
*  But you would see where during [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2668.8599999999997s)]
*  Black Lives Matter protests, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2671.18s)]
*  there'd be talk about some cop who [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2673.62s)]
*  had killed an innocent person and [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2676.18s)]
*  wasn't held accountable. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2678.7s)]
*  And then there would be an equal [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2681.22s)]
*  amount of weight given to Aunt [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2682.62s)]
*  Jemima being removed from something. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2684.22s)]
*  And you're like, guys, guys, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2686.18s)]
*  guys, come on, priorities, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2688.02s)]
*  priorities. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2689.74s)]
*  And you watched as Obama would [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2690.5s)]
*  drop a drone bomb on a wedding in [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2692.66s)]
*  Yemen, and then people on the left [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2694.8199999999997s)]
*  would be talking about micro [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2697.06s)]
*  aggressions and safe spaces. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2698.8199999999997s)]
*  And you're like, guys, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2700.66s)]
*  what are we doing here? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2702.1s)]
*  This is just not nearly as [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2703.54s)]
*  important. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2705.2999999999997s)]
*  Even if you think this is a thing, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2706.22s)]
*  it's not as important of a thing. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2708.18s)]
*  And so anyway, I guess I'm just [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2710.5s)]
*  going a long way to say that what [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2712.06s)]
*  you're always weighing, whether [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2713.82s)]
*  you're willing to coalition with [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2715.74s)]
*  somebody, is how important is [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2717.74s)]
*  the thing that you're [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2719.66s)]
*  coalitioning about? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2721.06s)]
*  How important is it? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2723.18s)]
*  Are we talking about a goddamn [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2724.82s)]
*  genocide? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2726.38s)]
*  Well, then yeah, you coalition [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2727.38s)]
*  with anybody, anybody who's willing [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2728.9s)]
*  to coalition with you for that. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2730.82s)]
*  because who are you? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2732.74s)]
*  Who are you to ever turn anyone [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2734.1s)]
*  away who's going to support you [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2735.7s)]
*  ending a genocide? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2737.22s)]
*  I mean, if we were living in 1840 [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2738.78s)]
*  and we were a couple of [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2740.9s)]
*  abolitionists, me and you, Cenk, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2742.1s)]
*  would we say, well, I don't know, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2744.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, me and you disagree on [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2746.42s)]
*  taxes, me and you disagree on [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2747.94s)]
*  monetary policy, so we can't [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2749.74s)]
*  coalition together against slavery. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2751.66s)]
*  Or would we say, dude, at this [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2754.38s)]
*  point, there's no other issue. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2755.98s)]
*  There is no other issue. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2757.7799999999997s)]
*  We're abolitionists, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2759.58s)]
*  we're against slavery, that's it. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2760.46s)]
*  It doesn't even matter what else [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2762.74s)]
*  we disagree with. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2764.06s)]
*  This is the issue of our time. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2764.7799999999997s)]
*  And what are we talking about here, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2766.94s)]
*  man? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2768.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2768.8199999999997s)]
*  add them all up, add up the terror [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2770.38s)]
*  wars and add in Israel's [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2772.02s)]
*  destruction of Gaza to it too. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2773.26s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2775.38s)]
*  We have millions of people who have [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2776.94s)]
*  been slaughtered and [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2778.94s)]
*  trillions of dollars that [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2780.1800000000003s)]
*  have been wasted. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2781.7000000000003s)]
*  It's the most important issue of [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2782.5s)]
*  our time by far. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2784.1400000000003s)]
*  There's not even a close second. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2785.0600000000004s)]
*  And so, this is anybody who's [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2787.5s)]
*  like hesitant to coalition over [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2789.7400000000002s)]
*  this right now while we're at [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2792.02s)]
*  the precipice of another war. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2794.02s)]
*  I mean, come on, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2795.82s)]
*  that cannot be the case. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2797.1400000000003s)]
*  And so, it's just like we got to [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2799.02s)]
*  wake up, we got to learn that there [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2800.82s)]
*  are other issues we're going to [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2802.62s)]
*  disagree about. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2804.22s)]
*  There's going to be lots of really [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2805.02s)]
*  important issues we disagree about. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2806.42s)]
*  We don't have to not do that. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2807.94s)]
*  We don't have to pretend we're not [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2809.2599999999998s)]
*  disagreeing about them. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2810.78s)]
*  But this is so important that you [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2811.94s)]
*  have to coalition on this. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2813.66s)]
*  Anyway, that was part one. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2815.06s)]
*  I had a part two, but I'm sorry. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2816.34s)]
*  I got lost in that rant and [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2817.7s)]
*  forgot it. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2818.74s)]
*  I'll come back to it for a second. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2819.34s)]
*  So look, to your points, number [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2820.58s)]
*  one, remember this is layered, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2822.46s)]
*  right? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2824.22s)]
*  So if they vote yes for the war, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2824.74s)]
*  we're all voting yes to the war. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2826.58s)]
*  We're all voting them out no [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2828.42s)]
*  matter what, right? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2829.8s)]
*  Because it's not like the other [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2831.02s)]
*  Democrat in the primary or [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2832.26s)]
*  the other Republican in the primary [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2833.34s)]
*  isn't going to have most of [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2834.78s)]
*  the issues you agree with anyway, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2835.82s)]
*  right? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2837.34s)]
*  And second of all, if they vote no [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2838.1s)]
*  on the war, then we can go back to [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2839.7000000000003s)]
*  fighting about tax cuts and [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2841.14s)]
*  micro-aggression and all of that. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2842.46s)]
*  Right? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2844.06s)]
*  So it doesn't mean they get [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2845.38s)]
*  a free pass, they get to stay in [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2846.38s)]
*  Congress forever. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2847.7000000000003s)]
*  No, it's just table stakes, right? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2848.54s)]
*  But if you vote against America, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2850.86s)]
*  and you say no, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2852.7400000000002s)]
*  I want the elites to win. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2853.62s)]
*  I want the neocons to win. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2855.02s)]
*  I want Israel first to win. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2856.2200000000003s)]
*  I want all these guys to win and [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2857.66s)]
*  we're going to drive you into [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2858.8199999999997s)]
*  this war. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2859.8199999999997s)]
*  No, you're gone. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2860.22s)]
*  It's table stakes, okay? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2861.22s)]
*  We're not interested, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2863.3399999999997s)]
*  we're not having that conversation. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2864.2999999999997s)]
*  And so now to your point about this [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2866.02s)]
*  being the most important issue, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2868.06s)]
*  look, I remember growing up [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2870.06s)]
*  thinking, I wonder what I would [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2871.66s)]
*  have done during the Holocaust. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2873.3399999999997s)]
*  Would I have had enough courage to [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2874.94s)]
*  fight back? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2877.02s)]
*  Because at the time that required [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2878.46s)]
*  a tremendous amount of courage. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2880.5s)]
*  We look back at it and go, well, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2882.2999999999997s)]
*  of course we would all fought back, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2883.94s)]
*  right? But they didn't. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2885.74s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2887.22s)]
*  the Germans did not fight back. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2888.5s)]
*  And I always wondered if we would [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2890.22s)]
*  have had the courage to fight back, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2891.54s)]
*  right? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2893.02s)]
*  And so to you made the analogy [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2893.7s)]
*  about slavery, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2895.2599999999998s)]
*  I'll make the analogy about this. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2896.06s)]
*  So if at the time you were debating [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2898.3799999999997s)]
*  microaggressions instead of trying [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2900.66s)]
*  to stop the Holocaust, you made [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2903.2599999999998s)]
*  the wrong moral calculation, right? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2905.54s)]
*  And so here we have a genocide, and [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2908.2999999999997s)]
*  we now have a new war. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2910.3399999999997s)]
*  And we know how many hundreds of [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2911.62s)]
*  thousands of people died in Iraq. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2913.2999999999997s)]
*  We know how many soldiers we lost. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2915.38s)]
*  We know how much we lost. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2917.34s)]
*  If you can't unite on this, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2919.26s)]
*  you're basically saying we're not [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2920.46s)]
*  the United States of America. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2922.06s)]
*  And we're going to fight each [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2923.6600000000003s)]
*  other till the cows come home. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2924.98s)]
*  And by the way, Dave, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2927.26s)]
*  isn't this how the elites win? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2928.6600000000003s)]
*  They get you to look left, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2931.6600000000003s)]
*  to look right, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=2933.1400000000003s)]

*  because I do remember my second [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3110.8999999999996s)]

*  They all use propaganda. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3140.98s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3142.26s)]
*  Why do they launch propaganda [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3143.86s)]
*  campaigns? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3145.5s)]
*  It's because at least they believe, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3146.38s)]
*  I would argue they know, that they [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3149.02s)]
*  need to convince us of their [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3151.3s)]

*  They can't do this without that. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3154.42s)]
*  If you think about all of the major [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3156.98s)]
*  government policies, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3158.98s)]
*  they always needed propaganda [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3160.58s)]
*  campaigns to get them through. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3162.46s)]
*  Either side of any war, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3164.46s)]
*  even the just side of a war, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3166.02s)]

*  their people to do that. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3169.82s)]
*  And they have lost the ability, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3171.38s)]
*  they've lost the propaganda [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3173.7799999999997s)]
*  mechanism. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3175.7799999999997s)]
*  And so I don't know exactly what [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3177.18s)]
*  that means. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3178.8599999999997s)]

*  But the truth is, Joe Rogan and [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3203.3s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3205.42s)]
*  all the people out there, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3206.7000000000003s)]
*  they're just way less controlled [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3208.26s)]
*  than Bill O'Reilly and [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3210.42s)]
*  Sean Hannity and Chris Matthews [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3211.6200000000003s)]
*  were. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3213.46s)]
*  And so we at least have a fighting [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3214.1400000000003s)]
*  shot now, these guys will at least [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3216.1800000000003s)]
*  host voices that will break down [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3218.3s)]
*  the opposing point of view. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3220.42s)]
*  So yeah, we got a fighting shot [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3223.6600000000003s)]
*  like we've never had before. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3225.2200000000003s)]
*  And then at the same time, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3226.86s)]
*  it's almost something out of a [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3228.3s)]
*  Greek tragedy or a biblical story. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3230.0s)]
*  We got a fighting shot like we've [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3232.42s)]
*  never had before. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3234.2200000000003s)]
*  And also, we're in a much more [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3235.1s)]
*  dangerous and much weaker position. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3237.02s)]
*  Our country is $37 trillion in [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3239.38s)]
*  debt and we're very divided [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3242.14s)]
*  culturally and Iran is a much [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3244.5s)]
*  tougher opponent than the other [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3247.02s)]
*  countries in the war. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3249.7400000000002s)]
*  So okay, so we're at a point here. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3251.82s)]
*  And I think this is, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3254.5s)]
*  let me just say this, I'm sorry if [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3255.46s)]
*  I'm ranting for too long. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3257.1800000000003s)]
*  But I like to make this point, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3258.46s)]
*  sometimes people will ask me, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3260.42s)]
*  especially young men, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3262.58s)]
*  ask me this a lot. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3264.26s)]
*  How do you not get blackpilled? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3266.06s)]
*  How do you not just be depressed [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3268.7000000000003s)]
*  about the future? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3270.1800000000003s)]
*  If I just laid out this case where [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3271.82s)]
*  we have this amazing opportunity, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3273.26s)]
*  but also the odds are stacked [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3274.9s)]
*  against us and the situation is [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3276.1800000000003s)]
*  more dire than ever before. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3277.62s)]
*  What do you do in that situation? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3279.34s)]
*  And the analogy that I like to use [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3281.46s)]
*  is like, look, I got a wife and [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3283.94s)]
*  I got two little kids. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3286.46s)]
*  If I look out my door and I see [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3288.54s)]
*  five men with AR-15s rushing my [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3291.38s)]
*  house and they're coming in to kill [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3294.7s)]
*  me and my family, and [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3297.98s)]
*  I just have one gun in my house. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3299.98s)]
*  I could sit there and go, man, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3303.5s)]
*  I'm blackpilled, this sucks. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3306.66s)]
*  There's five of them, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3310.42s)]
*  they got better guns than I got. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3311.78s)]
*  This is so unfair. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3313.7s)]
*  I just don't see how I'm possibly [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3315.2200000000003s)]
*  going to win this situation. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3316.94s)]
*  Listen, dude, you don't have [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3319.42s)]
*  the option to feel that way. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3321.1800000000003s)]
*  You got a gun, okay, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3323.58s)]
*  try to get down low, turn the lights [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3324.98s)]
*  off, take out their legs while [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3327.02s)]
*  they're coming in. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3328.6600000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3329.7000000000003s)]
*  I got some gasoline in my shed, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3330.54s)]
*  maybe I could build a makeshift [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3332.02s)]
*  bomb real quick and [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3333.42s)]
*  launch it at them. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3334.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't care, you go out fighting. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3335.14s)]
*  If you've got a shot and [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3337.2200000000003s)]
*  your family's on the line, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3339.14s)]
*  then what are we talking about here? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3341.58s)]
*  You go for it and [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3344.9s)]
*  you try your best. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3345.86s)]
*  And so right now, it's like if [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3347.1s)]
*  we're going to go out, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3348.6600000000003s)]
*  let's at least go out trying our [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3349.7400000000002s)]
*  best to do something. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3351.34s)]
*  We got better odds than a lot of [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3352.86s)]
*  people before us. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3354.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, Cenk, as I'm sure you [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3355.1800000000003s)]
*  know the history of this well, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3356.38s)]
*  there were anti-war protesters [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3357.7400000000002s)]
*  during World War I, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3359.34s)]
*  who simply just got locked up by [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3360.38s)]
*  the Wilson regime. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3361.94s)]
*  They just got thrown in insane [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3363.5s)]
*  asylums or prisons or whatever. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3365.1s)]
*  In fact, Eugene Depp's, right? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3367.34s)]
*  There was a presidential candidate [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3368.46s)]
*  who ran for president from prison. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3370.3s)]
*  And so we have it so much better [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3372.54s)]
*  than some people in the past had [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3374.2599999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3376.02s)]
*  We have so much more of [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3376.54s)]
*  a fighting shot. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3377.58s)]
*  And if they didn't just give up, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3378.3799999999997s)]
*  then we don't have the right to [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3380.06s)]
*  just give up. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3381.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think what you're looking [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3382.8999999999996s)]
*  for is this time to man up, okay? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3384.8199999999997s)]
*  And so, and look, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3387.1s)]
*  this is why I hate the culture [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3388.2599999999998s)]
*  wars. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3390.18s)]
*  There's so many reasons to the [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3391.22s)]
*  point that you made. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3392.8599999999997s)]
*  Like guys, it doesn't matter if [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3394.14s)]
*  somebody says man up. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3395.66s)]
*  It doesn't mean that women can't [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3396.74s)]
*  do it, right? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3398.22s)]
*  You can say knuckle up like [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3398.8199999999997s)]
*  Richard Ojeda does. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3400.22s)]
*  You can say cowboy up, and [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3401.66s)]
*  that doesn't mean that you're [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3402.74s)]
*  not Native Americans. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3404.02s)]
*  Just calm down and [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3405.06s)]
*  just get together, right? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3406.62s)]
*  And listen to what Dave said. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3409.1s)]
*  The culture wars, it's not that [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3411.1s)]
*  things in there aren't important. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3412.9s)]
*  I'm Muslim, so I get it. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3414.7s)]
*  Some people can get attacked for [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3416.46s)]
*  their religion, etc., and [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3418.22s)]
*  their identity, and [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3419.74s)]
*  it's terrible, right? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3420.82s)]
*  So we're not minimizing it. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3422.18s)]
*  But they use it to divide us. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3423.74s)]
*  They get us to fight one another, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3426.5s)]
*  and the culture wars is the main [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3428.78s)]
*  weapon they use to get us to fight [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3431.02s)]
*  each other, why? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3433.22s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3434.58s)]
*  Because if we're fighting each [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3435.8999999999996s)]
*  other, we're not looking up, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3437.5s)]
*  right? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3439.2599999999998s)]
*  And Dave- [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3440.4599999999996s)]
*  Well, look, let me put it like [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3440.9599999999996s)]
*  this, right? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3442.66s)]
*  Say something like abortion, okay? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3443.3799999999997s)]
*  Abortion's a very important issue, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3445.8999999999996s)]
*  no matter what side of it you're on. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3448.06s)]
*  If you're on the, from the pro [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3450.1s)]
*  choice perspective, people are [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3452.3399999999997s)]
*  trying to infringe on women's [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3454.9399999999996s)]
*  basic natural rights. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3457.2999999999997s)]
*  And they're controlling their [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3459.58s)]
*  medical decisions, and [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3461.18s)]
*  they're controlling their bodies, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3462.5s)]

*  a baby to term. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3466.3s)]
*  From the pro choice position, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3467.26s)]
*  this is a very, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3468.98s)]
*  very important issue. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3469.82s)]
*  From the pro life position, it's [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3471.54s)]
*  a very, very important issue. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3473.1s)]
*  It's the murder of babies, and [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3474.5s)]
*  you want to stop the murder [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3475.98s)]
*  of babies. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3477.3s)]
*  Wherever you fall on that, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3478.3s)]
*  I'm not denying it's a very [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3479.62s)]
*  important issue. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3480.82s)]
*  The point is that no one in power [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3482.02s)]
*  is threatened by that issue. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3484.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3486.46s)]
*  So they don't mind you fighting [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3487.2200000000003s)]
*  about that. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3488.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3489.46s)]
*  you go fight about that. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3490.2200000000003s)]
*  You go fight about trans bathrooms [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3491.42s)]
*  and what you should say about [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3493.54s)]
*  transgender people's preferred [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3495.2200000000003s)]
*  pronouns and all this. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3497.14s)]
*  I'm not even saying, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3498.78s)]
*  none of us are saying you shouldn't [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3499.7000000000003s)]
*  have a side in that issue. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3501.2200000000003s)]
*  No one's saying that it's not [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3502.38s)]
*  a very important issue. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3503.62s)]
*  But the point is like peep game [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3504.66s)]
*  here, as they used to say in [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3506.86s)]
*  the 90s, see what's really going [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3508.9s)]
*  on. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3511.46s)]
*  Why are all the most powerful [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3511.98s)]
*  billionaires and [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3513.94s)]
*  giant corporate interests pushing [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3515.06s)]
*  these culture war issues? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3517.5s)]
*  Maybe it's so [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3519.5s)]
*  that we don't pay attention to what [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3520.2599999999998s)]
*  they're doing, which is destroying [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3522.14s)]
*  our country. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3524.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3524.98s)]
*  So that's the point of it. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3525.5s)]
*  It's not that we shouldn't fight [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3527.3799999999997s)]
*  about these things or [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3528.66s)]
*  that they're not important. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3529.3399999999997s)]
*  It's just that we should at least [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3530.5s)]
*  notice that they think we're so [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3532.18s)]
*  stupid that we'll be distracted by [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3533.8599999999997s)]
*  this and not notice what they're [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3535.7799999999997s)]
*  doing to us. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3537.54s)]
*  Yeah, and it's okay to be honest [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3538.3399999999997s)]
*  about your side. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3540.2599999999998s)]
*  Chapter five of my book, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3541.3799999999997s)]
*  Justice is Coming, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3542.9399999999996s)]
*  is about the matrix. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3544.1s)]
*  That's mainstream media and [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3545.5s)]
*  how Chris Matthews lied us into [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3547.3399999999997s)]
*  going to Iraq war. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3549.18s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3550.2599999999998s)]
*  you read some of his comments, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3551.7s)]
*  describing George Bush as a cowboy [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3553.66s)]
*  and someone else is a soldier and [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3556.1s)]
*  he just plays dress up and [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3558.2599999999998s)]
*  my God, the power force so amazing. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3560.14s)]
*  That's why we have to go in Iraq, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3562.7799999999997s)]
*  etc. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3564.98s)]
*  And he was supposed to be [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3565.54s)]
*  a Democrat. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3567.14s)]
*  Obama did violate due process. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3568.46s)]
*  He killed people, he killed [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3570.58s)]
*  American citizens without due [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3572.2599999999998s)]
*  process. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3574.2999999999997s)]
*  When you open that door, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3575.06s)]
*  then very bad things come out of [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3576.7s)]
*  that door. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3578.74s)]
*  It's important that you hold your [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3579.3399999999997s)]
*  own side accountable because you [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3581.06s)]
*  don't know what the other side is [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3582.74s)]
*  going to do with it. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3584.3799999999997s)]
*  And besides which, at the end of [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3585.58s)]
*  the day, you should care more about [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3587.54s)]
*  being an American than you should [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3589.66s)]
*  about either side that you're on, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3591.62s)]
*  right? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3593.62s)]
*  Whether it's parties, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3594.2599999999998s)]
*  it's ethnicities, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3595.4199999999996s)]
*  whatever it might be. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3596.4599999999996s)]
*  So Dave, to conclude here, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3597.66s)]
*  at least I'm look, a lot of people [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3599.5s)]
*  will say no way Cenk doesn't [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3601.66s)]
*  represent the left, somebody else [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3603.66s)]
*  does or the other guy does, etc. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3606.06s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3608.38s)]
*  But for whoever agrees with me on [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3609.1800000000003s)]
*  the left, that we should get [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3610.86s)]
*  together to fight against this war [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3612.46s)]
*  because this war is that important. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3614.38s)]
*  I will say on behalf of those [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3616.58s)]
*  people on the left, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3618.38s)]
*  I am happy to make an alliance with [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3619.56s)]
*  you. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3621.54s)]
*  And I think that in terms of [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3622.2000000000003s)]
*  libertarians, I don't know anyone [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3623.5s)]
*  that represents them better than [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3625.26s)]
*  you do. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3626.78s)]
*  So do we have an alliance here [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3627.38s)]
*  between progressives and [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3629.1800000000003s)]
*  libertarians to fight the war [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3630.78s)]
*  together? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3632.54s)]
*  Yeah, 100% to fight the war is [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3633.34s)]
*  an interesting phrase to use in [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3636.22s)]
*  this particular context, but [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3638.3399999999997s)]
*  I get what you're saying. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3640.2999999999997s)]
*  And yes, 100%. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3641.9399999999996s)]
*  And I also think it's good for [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3643.14s)]
*  people to understand that a lot of [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3645.4199999999996s)]
*  these distinctions are somewhat, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3648.14s)]
*  they're somewhat of an illusion and [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3650.9399999999996s)]
*  they're somewhat arbitrary. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3653.58s)]
*  I'm not saying there's anything, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3655.9799999999996s)]
*  there are differences between left [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3657.9799999999996s)]
*  wing people and right wing people. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3660.02s)]
*  The truth is that I think almost [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3662.02s)]
*  all of us have a left winger and [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3663.9s)]
*  a right winger within us. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3666.06s)]
*  I guess it's just true in general [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3667.82s)]
*  in life, there are areas that [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3669.82s)]
*  you're a little bit more [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3671.6200000000003s)]
*  conservative. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3673.06s)]
*  There's an areas where you're a [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3673.86s)]
*  little bit more liberal. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3675.6200000000003s)]
*  And that's true in general. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3677.1400000000003s)]
*  These terms in a way, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3679.6200000000003s)]
*  the left meaning more egalitarian, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3681.1800000000003s)]
*  right meaning more hierarchical. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3684.1400000000003s)]
*  We're all a little bit of both of [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3686.98s)]
*  those things in some ways. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3689.2200000000003s)]
*  And I think that's a good [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3691.1400000000003s)]
*  point to make about these things [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3692.82s)]
*  in some ways in our lives. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3694.9s)]
*  But the point is that, look, man, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3696.7400000000002s)]
*  there's really brilliant, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3698.6200000000003s)]
*  interesting left wing thinkers. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3700.02s)]
*  There's really brilliant, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3701.82s)]
*  interesting right wing thinkers. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3703.0600000000004s)]
*  I'd encourage people to read more [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3704.6600000000003s)]
*  of the opposite, you know what I [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3706.34s)]
*  mean? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3708.0600000000004s)]
*  Like if you're a left winger, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3708.5800000000004s)]

*  But yeah, again, this is an issue [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3712.1800000000003s)]
*  that's so important. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3714.2200000000003s)]
*  And it's really not like, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3715.98s)]
*  a lot of these things don't even [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3717.42s)]
*  come down to a left right divide. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3719.1400000000003s)]
*  It's not really about that. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3721.1000000000004s)]
*  You're opposing genocide and [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3723.5s)]
*  wars of choice. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3725.14s)]
*  Are you really talking about a left [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3726.22s)]
*  right split? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3727.8999999999996s)]
*  I think this is just kind of like [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3728.8199999999997s)]
*  a human being thing. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3730.2999999999997s)]
*  And we should all be against this. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3731.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean, what are we talking about [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3733.3799999999997s)]
*  here? We're talking about, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3734.7799999999997s)]
*  we just facilitated our greatest [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3736.22s)]
*  ally. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3738.06s)]
*  Maybe they facilitated us, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3738.62s)]
*  I don't exactly know what the [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3740.3399999999997s)]
*  relationship is these days. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3742.02s)]
*  But we just, at best case, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3743.98s)]
*  we facilitated our greatest ally [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3745.66s)]
*  to launch an aggressive sneak [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3747.8199999999997s)]
*  attack on a country that poses no [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3749.54s)]

*  whatsoever. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3753.1s)]
*  And we're going to go into a war of [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3753.86s)]
*  choice with them, come on, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3755.62s)]
*  we can all be against that. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3757.22s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3758.86s)]
*  let's lead by example. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3760.1s)]
*  We want the world to get the peace. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3761.58s)]
*  We want the Israelis and [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3763.7s)]
*  the Palestinians and [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3764.62s)]
*  the Israelis and [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3765.46s)]
*  the Iranians to get the peace. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3766.02s)]
*  So let's make peace with one [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3767.42s)]
*  another, and that peace can lead to [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3769.18s)]
*  the greater peace where we push [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3771.54s)]
*  the powerful into accepting things [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3773.74s)]
*  on our terms for once. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3776.38s)]
*  And do we all agree, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3777.86s)]
*  let's just say that we're [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3779.1s)]
*  all agree, look at the poll, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3780.94s)]
*  only 16% want this war. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daYPshdWuxs&t=3782.7000000000003s)]
