"The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the Trump administration to temporarily pause a humanitarian program that has allowed nearly half a million people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to enter the U.S. and remain here legally for two years.
The move to grant a stay in the case means that the Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who were granted temporary parole under the program known as CHNV would lose their temporary legal status to be in the U.S. ‚Äî and could potentially be deported while the case plays out in the lower courts."

# SCOTUS Gives Thumbs Up To Trump's Deportation Squads
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4)
*  I think this is just part of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=0.0s)]
*  process of making America a less [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=2.2s)]
*  great country. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=4.62s)]
*  This is a place that people [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=5.78s)]
*  literally around the world love are [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=8.18s)]
*  dying to come to at least previously. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=11.48s)]
*  And we're now in a process of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=14.88s)]
*  unwinding our status as the most [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=17.18s)]
*  exalted country on planet Earth. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=19.84s)]
*  And for what I have no idea, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=22.78s)]
*  my heart just breaks for [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=24.94s)]
*  the people caught in the middle of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=26.64s)]
*  this process. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=28.900000000000002s)]
*  The Supreme Court revealed earlier [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=29.979999999999997s)]
*  today that Donald Trump and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=31.86s)]
*  his administration will be allowed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=33.28s)]
*  to end a program that gave [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=35.22s)]
*  temporary protection to more than [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=36.6s)]
*  500,000 immigrants from Cuba, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=38.68s)]
*  Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=40.78s)]
*  likely accelerating the speed at [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=43.18s)]
*  which they're going to be sent out [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=45.26s)]
*  of the country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=47.26s)]
*  And if you've been following [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=48.62s)]
*  immigration news and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=50.06s)]
*  the court rulings about it, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=51.18s)]
*  I know there's been a lot, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=52.62s)]
*  he's stopped, then it's revoked, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  then the Supreme Court jumps in. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=55.78s)]
*  To be very clear, this is different [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=57.46s)]
*  from what they announced on May [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=59.38s)]
*  19th when they allowed the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  administration to revoke temporary [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  protected status from a group of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=64.34s)]
*  almost 350,000 Venezuelans. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=66.04s)]
*  That's a separate thing, but [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=67.8s)]
*  you can combine those two groups, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=69.10000000000001s)]
*  and it's almost a million people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=70.8s)]
*  that had special protections that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=72.4s)]
*  now will be able to be shipped out [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=74.10000000000001s)]
*  to whatever their fate may be. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  So different rulings. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=77.62s)]
*  And how we got here was that back [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=79.1s)]
*  in April, a federal judge [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=81.2s)]
*  temporarily blocked them revoking [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=82.9s)]
*  those Biden era protections. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=85.22s)]
*  The parole programs had [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=87.30000000000001s)]
*  granted the immigrants temporary [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  legal protections after they fled [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=90.66000000000001s)]
*  violence from their home countries. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=92.56s)]
*  I'm sure the situations in those [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  home countries is fine now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=96.42s)]
*  They're not going to face [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=98.0s)]
*  persecution, violence, or [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  But that's what they decided, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=101.68s)]
*  there were dissents though. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  Justice Katanji Brown Jackson wrote [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=104.56s)]
*  that the high court, quote, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=106.44s)]
*  plainly botched its assessment and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=107.9s)]
*  undervalued the, quote, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=109.76s)]
*  devastating consequences of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=111.04s)]
*  allowing the government to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  precipitously upend the lives and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=113.84s)]
*  livelihoods of nearly a half [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  million non-citizens amid pending [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=116.94s)]
*  legal claims. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=118.86s)]
*  She argued that the government [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  failed to satisfy its burden of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=121.8s)]
*  demonstrating harm, saying ending [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=123.38s)]
*  the program will have, quote, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  devastating consequences. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=126.58s)]
*  While it is apparent that the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=128.02s)]
*  government seeks a stay to enable [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=129.38s)]
*  it to inflict maximum [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=131.06s)]
*  pre-decision damage, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=132.18s)]
*  court ordered stays exist to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=133.6s)]
*  minimize, not maximize, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=135.32s)]
*  harm to litigating parties. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=136.94s)]
*  Basically, as the legal process [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=138.82s)]
*  theoretically would continue, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=140.82s)]
*  they're going to do what they do, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=142.82s)]
*  which is pack as many people as [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=144.82s)]
*  they can around military planes and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=146.58s)]
*  send them wherever. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  Maybe the country they're originally [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=150.02s)]
*  from, maybe Sudan, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=151.98000000000002s)]
*  maybe Guantanamo Bay. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=153.02s)]
*  And if it turns out that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=154.3s)]
*  the legal process actually does [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=155.34s)]
*  rule in their favor, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=156.78s)]
*  what are you going to do? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=157.86s)]
*  Supreme Court doesn't have any [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=159.74s)]
*  guns, they can tell him to bring [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  back as many people as they want, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=162.3s)]
*  he's clearly not going to do it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=163.66000000000003s)]
*  But I'm glad that she pointed out [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=165.62s)]
*  the actual harm that will be done [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=167.54000000000002s)]
*  to these individuals when they get [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=169.5s)]
*  wherever they're going. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=171.58s)]
*  I would also acknowledge the harm [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=173.02s)]
*  to America by having a half million [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=174.98s)]
*  people torn from communities away [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=177.3s)]
*  from family and friends, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=179.42s)]
*  their workplaces, where they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=181.02s)]
*  contribute in a million different [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=182.98s)]
*  ways. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=185.26s)]
*  And then you put up all of that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=185.98s)]
*  against an abstract, ill-defined or [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=188.06s)]
*  conspiratorially defined harm that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  is put on to every migrant. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  You're destroying America. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=196.62s)]
*  How? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=198.1s)]
*  Who the hell knows? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=199.1s)]
*  Most of the people being deported [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=199.74s)]
*  haven't committed any crimes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=200.74s)]
*  But their mere presence here is not [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=202.06s)]
*  just a threat, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=204.38s)]
*  it's an emergency actually. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=205.26s)]
*  habeas corpus set it aside, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=207.78s)]
*  did you know we've been invaded? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=209.3s)]
*  And so the entire thing is very [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=211.62s)]
*  frustrating and seeing the Supreme [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=212.74s)]
*  Court go along with it, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=214.18s)]
*  it's frustrating as well. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=215.26s)]
*  Waz, I want to go to you first, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=217.02s)]
*  what do you think of this? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=217.94s)]
*  I mean, it's really difficult when [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=220.94s)]
*  you sit and think about the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=224.14s)]
*  circumstances that brought these [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=227.34s)]
*  folks over here and just trying to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=230.34s)]
*  make it in America is difficult [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=233.34s)]
*  enough. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=236.5s)]
*  And I think the most frustrating [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=238.62s)]
*  part is that the previous [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=241.7s)]
*  administration did basically open [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=244.18s)]
*  up some of the rules and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=247.74s)]
*  restrictions that would allow [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=250.22s)]
*  these people to pursue cases [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=253.34s)]
*  through our legal process to stay [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=256.06s)]
*  here legally. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=259.06s)]
*  But this effectively, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=260.42s)]
*  does is achieve a rug pull from [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=262.86s)]
*  underneath those folks. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=265.62s)]
*  And what people on the right would [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=269.14s)]
*  say is that well, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=271.62s)]
*  while Joe Biden overreached, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=272.98s)]
*  we got a mandate from our election [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  that the people didn't necessarily [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  want all of those expansions in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=280.7s)]
*  the asylum seeking process. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=283.22s)]
*  And it's too bad, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=285.86s)]
*  we got to let them go. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=287.18s)]
*  I think this is just part of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=290.06s)]
*  the process of making America a less [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=291.9s)]
*  great country. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=294.34s)]
*  This is a place that people [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=296.54s)]
*  literally around the world love are [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=298.42s)]
*  dying to come to at least previously. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=300.94s)]
*  And we're now in a process of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=304.62s)]
*  unwinding our status as the most [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=306.82s)]
*  exalted country on planet Earth. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=309.34s)]
*  And for what I have no idea, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=312.5s)]
*  my heart just breaks for [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=314.58s)]
*  the people caught in the middle of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=316.26s)]
*  this process. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, a lot of it has [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=320.58s)]
*  already been unwound and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=322.18s)]
*  the important part of what was [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  open with there and talked about [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  was sort of denying, it's an [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=327.06s)]
*  implicit denial of what happens to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=328.85999999999996s)]
*  these people back home, while also [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=331.06s)]
*  denying because they're not talking [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=333.38s)]
*  about it, what it does to business [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=335.62s)]
*  here and what it does to business [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  owners here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=339.62s)]
*  And again, you're talking about [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=340.46s)]
*  taking business owners and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=342.78s)]
*  small businesses and saying you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=344.7s)]
*  can't have these people working [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=346.97999999999996s)]
*  for you, but you also have tariffs [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=349.46000000000004s)]
*  and you also have all of these [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  difficulties and you also have [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=353.42s)]
*  the high prices. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=355.5s)]
*  It's handcuffing the nation [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=356.62s)]
*  financially, which you wouldn't [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=358.26s)]
*  think he would want to do except [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=360.18s)]
*  that it helps one tenth of 1% of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=361.98s)]
*  the country. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=363.98s)]
*  But the other side of this is that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  these are legitimate, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=367.02000000000004s)]
*  most of these cases are legitimate. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=368.70000000000005s)]
*  I did a series from Guatemala and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  Honduras for another network, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=373.5s)]
*  a TV network, where I was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=375.5s)]
*  interviewing a gangster, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=377.66s)]
*  somebody who is a gangster in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=379.54s)]
*  Honduras, who told me the way it [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=381.5s)]
*  worked and how he would go into [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  these towns and villages, not just [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=385.90000000000003s)]
*  himself, but as part of a group. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=388.46s)]
*  And as soon as somebody came home [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=391.02s)]
*  from earning whatever pittance of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=392.82s)]
*  a wage they earned that day, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=394.74s)]
*  they would extort it from them. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=396.34000000000003s)]
*  And if they didn't, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=398.18s)]
*  they would threaten them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=398.98s)]
*  They would rape women, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=399.86s)]
*  they would steal things, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=401.3s)]
*  These are places that are [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=403.58s)]
*  horrendous if you're not part of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=405.46000000000004s)]
*  that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=407.66s)]
*  Now this guy was reformed, but [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=408.16s)]
*  he told me exactly what it was [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=410.14000000000004s)]
*  like. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=411.98s)]
*  These are legitimate cases and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=412.48s)]
*  that is who we let into this [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  country. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=415.98s)]
*  And to deport them and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=416.94s)]
*  send them back to those horrors, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=417.86s)]
*  which we're in essence doing, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  the horrors haven't gone away just [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=420.94s)]
*  because they're here because there [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=422.5s)]
*  are other people still there. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=424.06s)]
*  That is ignoring what the principle [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=425.38s)]
*  of our immigration system is and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=427.66s)]
*  these people are entitled to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=429.58000000000004s)]
*  hearings and maybe making the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=431.38s)]
*  courts more effective and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=433.3s)]
*  having more immigration judges out [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=435.06s)]
*  there would be a better way of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=437.14s)]
*  dealing with this than sending [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=438.74s)]
*  people back to these dangerous, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=440.46s)]
*  dangerous places. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=442.26s)]
*  You talk about Nicaragua and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=443.3s)]
*  Venezuela, I don't know about Cuba [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=444.66s)]
*  being dangerous, but I know about [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=446.5s)]
*  Haiti being quite dangerous. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=448.06s)]
*  I mean, maybe the most dangerous [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=449.42s)]
*  of all of them for so [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=450.86s)]
*  many of these people and women and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=451.74s)]
*  breaking up families. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=453.34s)]
*  It's a horrendous thing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=454.46s)]
*  Now, this is not a ruling [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=455.7s)]
*  necessarily even though we call it [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=457.06s)]
*  a rule, I guess it's a ruling, but [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=458.98s)]
*  it's not a case that has been [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=460.94s)]
*  decided, it's just a case that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=462.74s)]
*  it's just saying the courts have [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=464.58s)]
*  to do a little more in pursuing [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=466.5s)]
*  whether or not this comes to us [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=468.3s)]
*  eventually, but it's an indication [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=470.18s)]
*  of the way it's going to go in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=472.46s)]
*  the aftermath of that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think that we don't always [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=476.02s)]
*  agree on the panel, but [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=478.09999999999997s)]
*  I think that we're all uniformly [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=479.58s)]
*  experiencing the bias of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=481.7s)]
*  considering these people as people. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=483.38s)]
*  But have you considered what if you [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  just hated their guts, them and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=489.02s)]
*  everyone who looks like them? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=490.74s)]
*  Or even if you didn't personally, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=492.78s)]
*  what if you were trying to appeal [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=494.5s)]
*  to other voters that you think do? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=496.1s)]
*  What if it was that? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=497.94s)]
*  What if you didn't care at all [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=498.54s)]
*  about the Constitution, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=499.86s)]
*  the rule of law, any of it? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=500.94s)]
*  And you just saw them as parasites [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=502.86s)]
*  or wanted to spread the myth that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=504.74s)]
*  they are parasites. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=506.42s)]
*  What about that? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=507.58s)]
*  How would you act in that case? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=508.1s)]
*  The entire thing is just utterly [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=510.06s)]
*  grotesque, to Was' point, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=512.02s)]
*  the make America great again thing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=513.9s)]
*  has been, it's terrible for so [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=516.18s)]
*  many different reasons, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=518.14s)]
*  what it intentionally harkens back [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=519.78s)]
*  to all of that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=521.98s)]
*  But it's also just so wildly [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=523.34s)]
*  inaccurate about what they're [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=524.7800000000001s)]
*  actually trying to achieve. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=526.22s)]
*  Whatever else you think America is [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=527.9s)]
*  or is becoming, great has got [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=530.14s)]
*  nothing to do with it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=532.02s)]
*  We're not aspiring to greatness, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=534.22s)]
*  we're aspiring to be small and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=536.7s)]
*  cruel, grubby, selfish, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=538.7800000000001s)]
*  like wanting to inspire, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=540.98s)]
*  as Was was saying, other people to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=542.98s)]
*  dream someday of being a part of us. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=545.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't even know why people would [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=548.38s)]
*  at this point, and that's the goal. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=550.38s)]
*  As much as John is, you're right [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=552.58s)]
*  about that with great and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=554.62s)]
*  looking at that word. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=556.4200000000001s)]
*  Again, is just a big part of that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=558.5400000000001s)]
*  too. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=560.7s)]
*  Again, when was again? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=561.3000000000001s)]
*  I would ask this for TYT for [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=562.82s)]
*  people waiting online at rallies to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=564.6600000000001s)]
*  go into Trump rallies all across [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=566.98s)]
*  the country. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=569.1800000000001s)]
*  And nobody could articulate when [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=570.0600000000001s)]
*  then was, and then when you did and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=572.14s)]
*  you said that while the year you [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=574.22s)]
*  cite, black people had to sit [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=576.1s)]
*  upstairs in a movie theater in [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=577.9000000000001s)]
*  the back of a bus, right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=579.62s)]
*  Was it great for everyone? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=581.1s)]
*  And then we famously had, or [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=582.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't know how famous, but [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=584.3000000000001s)]
*  we showed this one black guy who [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=586.22s)]
*  I was talking to in Michigan, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=588.38s)]
*  who said, yeah, but [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=590.22s)]
*  it was still better then. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=591.34s)]
*  What? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=593.82s)]
*  And these are the people that are [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=594.34s)]
*  lining up and go into these tail [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=596.34s)]
*  gates to see Donald Trump. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=598.26s)]
*  And so again, nobody can define [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  what again is, but we know that, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=602.22s)]
*  and this I'm sure we agree on, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=604.34s)]
*  that again is elusive. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=606.3000000000001s)]
*  We don't know when that was. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=607.94s)]
*  Yeah, I know, I feel like, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=610.7s)]
*  this is going to get wonky, but [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=612.1800000000001s)]
*  I feel like Maha should be make [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=614.0600000000001s)]
*  America hierarchical again. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=615.82s)]
*  Just give us the hierarchy that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=617.98s)]
*  made us comfortable. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=619.22s)]
*  I want to automatically win. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=620.1s)]
*  No, I don't think it's not much of [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=623.02s)]
*  a bumper sticker. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=624.26s)]
*  We're not a winning Maha. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=624.86s)]
*  But that is what it is, actually. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=626.5s)]
*  Anyway, and I know Was was [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=629.38s)]
*  satirizing what they would say, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=631.4200000000001s)]
*  him not saying it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=633.9s)]
*  But make mandate mean something [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=635.1800000000001s)]
*  again, the idea that Donald Trump [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=638.54s)]
*  has a mandate. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=640.62s)]
*  He didn't even get 50% of the vote. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=642.14s)]
*  He got the narrowest possible [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=643.98s)]
*  victory. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=645.54s)]
*  Well, it's only defined as [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=646.26s)]
*  a mandate by him. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=647.22s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=648.3s)]
*  I hear news people being like, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=648.98s)]
*  well, he did talk about doing this [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=650.38s)]
*  stuff. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=652.22s)]
*  No, I understand that. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=652.74s)]
*  And there is something to that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=653.9s)]
*  If you run on something, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=655.3s)]
*  I guess we can't be too shocked [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=656.58s)]
*  when you actually do it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=658.02s)]
*  But you didn't get a mandate. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=659.74s)]
*  I mean, if you got a mandate, then [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=660.98s)]
*  Barack Obama literally should have [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=662.42s)]
*  ascended into heaven as a god. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=663.94s)]
*  And if AOC wins with 54% of the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=665.46s)]
*  vote, then she can take every [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=668.02s)]
*  single gun and just melt it down [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=669.98s)]
*  into a big carbon processing [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=671.98s)]
*  factory or whatever. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=673.9399999999999s)]
*  Because he did not get a goddamn [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=675.5799999999999s)]
*  mandate. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=677.5799999999999s)]
*  John, you need a birth certificate [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=678.18s)]
*  to get into heaven. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=679.86s)]
*  So forget it for Obama. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=680.6999999999999s)]
*  He did the protest against him. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=682.14s)]
*  He was illegitimate with his [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=683.8199999999999s)]
*  massive victory. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGQcOzJOul4&t=685.26s)]
