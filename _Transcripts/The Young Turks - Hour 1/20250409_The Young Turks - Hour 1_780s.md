# Trump Announces Tariffs On Imported Pharmaceuticals
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E)
*  But we're gonna tariff our pharmaceuticals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=0.0s)]
*  And once we do that, they're gonna come rushing back into our country because we're the big [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=2.88s)]
*  market. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=7.04s)]
*  The advantage we have over everybody is that we're the big market. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  So we're gonna be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  And when they hear that, they will leave China, they will leave other places because they [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  have to sell most of their product is sold here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=23.6s)]
*  And Donald Trump made that announcement in regard to pending tariffs on pharmaceutical [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=28.76s)]
*  drugs the night before he announced that he would implement a 90 day pause on some of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=34.36s)]
*  the reciprocal tariffs that he implemented against our trade partners. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=40.2s)]
*  So for the moment being, we're uncertain as to whether Trump is actually gonna go through [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=43.92s)]
*  with tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=49.32s)]
*  However, while I agree with individuals who believe that it's critical for the US to manufacture [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=52.2s)]
*  medicine domestically, I would like to see some strategy in place to make sure that we [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=57.62s)]
*  have manufacturing capacity set and ready to go before implementing steep tariffs on pharmaceutical [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=64.82s)]
*  drugs that are imported to the US. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  Because big pharma already has a sweet little situation where they can price gouge Americans [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=74.9s)]
*  on pharmaceutical drugs. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=81.02s)]
*  Imagine how much worse that's gonna be if the Trump administration implements or imposes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=82.94000000000001s)]
*  tariffs on pharmaceutical imports without having a plan in place ahead of time to mitigate [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=88.06s)]
*  some of the high costs that would result from those tariffs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  Now, initially, Trump had exempted pharmaceutical imports from his reciprocal tariffs policy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=99.98s)]
*  But now, he thinks that his tariffs will incentivize drug makers or drug companies to make drugs [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  here domestically, though he hasn't revealed what amount he plans to tax drug imports. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=113.36s)]
*  So he just kind of made that statement off the cuff during a speech, didn't give us any [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  specifics, we don't have a lot to go off of. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  But in 2024, the US imported $213 billion worth of medicines, more than two and a half [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=125.88s)]
*  times the total a decade earlier. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=133.12s)]
*  So look, we have become increasingly dependent on drug manufacturers abroad. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=136.4s)]
*  And I think that is a problem. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  I think it's important for us to produce drugs domestically. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  I am not against high tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs in order to ramp up production domestically. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=148.0s)]
*  But we need to have a plan in place to make sure we're ramping up production domestically. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  Of course, this has led to pharmaceutical companies panicking as the value of their [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=159.8s)]
*  shares declined amid the news that Trump announced yesterday. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=163.8s)]
*  So BMO Capital Markets Analyst, even Evan, I should say, Evan Seigerman, rejects the notion [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  that pharmaceutical companies will move production here to the United States to avoid tariffs [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  because he believes that Congress is actually gonna step in, which is interesting. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if Evan lives in the United States and is at all aware of how useless Congress [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=186.56s)]
*  is, but here's what he has to say. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  Given the complexity of the pharma supply chain, we do not expect the industry to make [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=193.44s)]
*  any major changes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  These current tariffs are being pursued under emergency powers, which at worst will last [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=200.0s)]
*  until the end of the current administration and could end sooner with an act of Congress. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=205.96s)]
*  Now look, should Trump actually go through with pharmaceutical tariffs? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=212.48s)]
*  The argument that, well, Trump's only in office for four years and after that it will be fine [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=217.72s)]
*  is not a good argument. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=222.24s)]
*  Obviously, a lot of damage can be done between now and then. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=223.28s)]
*  And we're not talking about items that people don't really need. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=227.6s)]
*  We're not talking about cheap junk that's manufactured abroad and consumed by Americans [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=231.4s)]
*  because they've been conditioned to believe that consumerism is the only way to be happy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=238.0s)]
*  That's not what we're talking about. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=241.6s)]
*  We're talking about medicines that people need to survive, that people need to treat [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=242.84s)]
*  various conditions. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=248.56s)]
*  So we're not playing around here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=250.32s)]
*  This isn't something that patients in America can just abstain from if they need these drugs [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=252.48s)]
*  to remain alive and healthy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=259.72s)]
*  Now despite Trump citing China in his justification for implementing tariffs on medicine or possibly [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=262.16s)]
*  doing so in the future, it turns out that the US is actually pretty dependent on Europe. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=268.04s)]
*  So the EU medical and pharmaceutical product exports to the United States totaled about [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=273.4s)]
*  90 billion euros or $97 billion in 2023. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=279.48s)]
*  And that's according to the latest Eurostat data. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=284.04s)]
*  Barclays or analysts over at Barclays said in a note last week that Europe accounted for about [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=286.92s)]
*  80% of the US trade deficit in biopharma. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=293.32s)]
*  Now, in addition to that, yes, we do rely on China to some extent when it comes to producing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=298.68s)]
*  pharmaceutical drugs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=304.68s)]
*  However, India is also another player. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  India's pharma exports to the US mostly comprise generics or cheaper versions of popular drugs. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=307.88s)]
*  The US accounts for a third of India's overall pharma exports. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=315.08s)]
*  So guys, that's huge because the profit margins on pharmaceutical drugs obviously are going to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=320.28s)]
*  be much lower. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  Pharmaceutical drugs or generic versions of pharmaceutical drugs are cheaper. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=327.52s)]
*  And so the companies producing them stand to profit a lot less. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=333.0s)]
*  If moving production to the United States is costly and will further eat into the profits [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=338.2s)]
*  of these drug producers, they're not going to do it when it comes to generic drugs. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=345.0s)]
*  So my point is, since we rely so heavily on a foreign country, India to produce [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=349.32s)]
*  generic versions of pharmaceutical drugs that we need, implementing these tariffs [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=356.12s)]
*  does not necessarily mean that those drugs will now be produced here in the United States. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=361.8s)]
*  And the only outcome as it pertains to generic drugs is that we will end up paying higher prices [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  for said medicines, which is a disaster. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=374.12s)]
*  So generic drug prices will likely go up. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  And the companies that produce those generic drugs in India include IPCA Labs, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=382.12s)]
*  Glenmark Pharma, and you also have Biocon. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=388.36s)]
*  And the makers of some of those Indian-made generic drugs say that the profit margin, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=391.32000000000005s)]
*  again, so low, they're not at all considering moving production to the United States. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  What's even more insane, though, is that Americans pay little or no tax on imports [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=400.76000000000005s)]
*  of Indian medicines compared with the duty of nearly 11% paid by Indians importing American [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  medicines. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=413.56s)]
*  Look, I give you that information because that is exactly the type of trade deficit that Trump will [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=414.44s)]
*  point to as justification for implementing these insane tariffs. But this setup, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=419.64s)]
*  do you guys understand this setup actually, it benefits Americans who are not paying tariffs [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=427.23999999999995s)]
*  on generic drugs that are being imported from India. And I get it, right? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=433.64s)]
*  US drug manufacturers don't make as much profit because the 11% tariff on US imports to India [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=438.52s)]
*  are tariffed at 11%, okay? So that is a disincentive for Indians to buy US-produced [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=448.52s)]
*  pharmaceutical drugs. I get it, it's not so great for the drug manufacturers in the States. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=457.24s)]
*  But this setup is not at all harming American citizens. American citizens are able to get [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=463.0s)]
*  their generic drugs that are produced in India for cheaper because there is no tariff associated [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  with that, they're not taxed on it. So drugs that are likely to be hit hardest by [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=476.2s)]
*  President Trump's tariffs, if he does go through with pharmaceutical tariffs, are made by Argen-X, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=483.08s)]
*  UCB, or Novo Nordisk, which I don't know if you know this, they're the makers of the popular [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=489.64000000000004s)]
*  diabetes and now weight loss drug Ozempic. And in contrast, the drug companies that are more immune [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=495.64000000000004s)]
*  due to their diverse global manufacturing network and capabilities to produce here in the United [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=502.44s)]
*  States include AstraZeneca, Roche, and Sanofi. But it doesn't matter because look guys, once [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=508.04s)]
*  tariffs are cited as the factor behind the inflationary pressures, the inflation that [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=517.24s)]
*  you see in the market, other companies that aren't even impacted by those tariffs, companies that [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=524.68s)]
*  produce the drugs domestically here in the United States, are just going to use the excuse of this [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=530.52s)]
*  inflationary period to up their prices as well. And if that doesn't make much sense to you, if [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=535.72s)]
*  maybe the way I'm articulating it is too confusing, I think Senator Elizabeth Warren did a really good [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=541.0s)]
*  job explaining it while speaking to CNBC. Take a look. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=545.72s)]
*  So I know you don't wanna listen to me on this, but listen to Jerome Powell on this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=548.76s)]
*  The example he gave on Friday was from the last time that Trump's tariffs went into effect. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  And he said there was a tariff on washing machines, no surprise, the price of washing [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=560.9200000000001s)]
*  machines went up. But the shocking part is the price of dryers went up as well, even though [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=566.36s)]
*  there was no imposition of tariffs on those. You tell me what that is except for price gouging. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=573.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to figure that out. Unless you have a clothesline out back, you need the dryer though, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=580.12s)]
*  Senator. Well, you need the dryer, but the price doesn't go up on dryers. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  The cost of dryers didn't go up. You had that in my house growing up. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=590.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Did you? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=593.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=593.64s)]
*  I loved the way you're changing the subject here. That is an example of price gouging. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=594.36s)]
*  They told me we had- I think it's time for you to eat that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=602.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. And I mean, we experienced that post-COVID pandemic when the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=606.76s)]
*  supply chain disruptions did lead to inflation in certain sectors of the economy. But that gave an [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=612.76s)]
*  excuse to other companies that were not at all impacted by supply chain issues to just raise [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=619.56s)]
*  their prices because the consumers will bear it. And they said as much during their shareholder [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=625.2399999999999s)]
*  meetings. So Senator Warren is absolutely right about that. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=630.84s)]
*  Now, again, I want to revisit the argument I made earlier about how I do think it's important [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=635.0s)]
*  to produce pharmaceutical drugs domestically. I think it's important for the security of this [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=640.0400000000001s)]
*  country because COVID also did show us that supply chain disruptions are going to impact [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=644.9200000000001s)]
*  the stock of pharmaceutical drugs in the United States. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=652.6s)]
*  There were all sorts of drug shortages during COVID because of those supply chain disruptions. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=656.36s)]
*  So I'm not against tariffs. In fact, I've gotten some heat from some portion of the audience [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=661.16s)]
*  because of my willingness or openness to implementing strategic targeted tariffs. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=666.6800000000001s)]
*  I think in some cases, guys, it does make sense. I just don't agree with the way that Trump is [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=672.44s)]
*  doing this because there aren't any plans in place to mitigate the pain that Americans are [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=679.0s)]
*  going to feel, especially as it pertains to things that are non-negotiable for Americans' [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=684.68s)]
*  lives like pharmaceutical drugs. And look, the one other thing I'll say is, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=689.7199999999999s)]
*  wouldn't it be far better for the Trump administration to do what Democrats failed to [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=695.9599999999999s)]
*  do, which was ensure that our Medicare system can negotiate the prices of all pharmaceutical drugs? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=701.2399999999999s)]
*  I mean, he'd be a hero if he did that. But it is interesting that he's not doing that. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=709.64s)]
*  Now, Democrats made it so we can negotiate the prices of 10 pharmaceutical drugs, many of which, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=715.16s)]
*  by the way, were about to run out of their copyright or their, yeah, so basically the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=722.68s)]
*  generic versions were going to come out anyway and it was going to be cheap. It would have been far [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=729.0s)]
*  better if you have a situation where Medicare wasn't being price gouged by pharmaceutical [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=732.44s)]
*  companies who get to charge whatever the hell they want with absolutely no negotiation. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=738.7600000000001s)]
*  He's not doing that. He's not focusing on that. I don't know if he's going to go through with the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=742.84s)]
*  pharmaceutical tariffs. I don't know if he's going to go through with any of these tariffs, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=746.6800000000001s)]
*  to be quite frank, because he goes back and forth all the time. Today, he announced a 90-day pause [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=750.6s)]
*  on some of the reciprocal tariffs he implemented against our trade partners. So we're just going [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=755.0s)]
*  to have to wait and see, which I hate ending any video or story with, but that's really the most [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=759.0s)]
*  honest thing I can say about what's happening right now. No one really knows what's in that [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=764.84s)]
*  man's head and what he's actually going to go through with. So we're going to have to wait and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=768.84s)]
*  see. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6BRQst9l7E&t=772.6s)]
