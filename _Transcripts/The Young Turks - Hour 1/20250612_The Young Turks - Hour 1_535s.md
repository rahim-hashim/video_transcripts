"It was supposed to be a routine appearance, a visit from the commander in chief to rally the troops, boost morale and celebrate the Army's 250th-birthday week, which culminates with a Washington, D.C., parade slated for Saturday.
Instead, what unfolded Tuesday at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, bore little resemblance to the customary visit from a president and defense secretary. There, President Donald Trump unleashed a speech laced with partisan invective, goading jeers from a crowd of soldiers positioned behind his podium -- blurring the long-standing and sacrosanct line between the military and partisan politics."

# Trump on Troops for Rally: "No Fat Soldiers"
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw)
*  The fake news, ladies and gentlemen, look at them. Look at them all. What I have to put up with. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=0.0s)]
*  Fake news. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=5.92s)]
*  This is a record crowd. You never had a crowd this big. That's an honor. You think this crowd [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=9.76s)]
*  would have showed up for Biden? I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. Maybe I'm wrong. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=15.44s)]
*  In Los Angeles, the governor of California, the mayor of Los Angeles. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=22.32s)]
*  They're incompetent. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=30.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump is continuing to obliterate long standing norms that separate our military [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=33.76s)]
*  from politics. And you just heard that with the uber partisan speech that he gave yesterday at [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=43.6s)]
*  Fort Bragg. Now, unfortunately, some soldiers can be heard in that video that we showed you, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=49.6s)]
*  cheering and jeering at Democratic politicians. But now, we're learning that his team handpicked [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=55.12s)]
*  the service members who stood behind him during this speech. So according to an investigation by [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=62.48s)]
*  military.com, internal 82nd Airborne Division Communications reveal a tightly orchestrated [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=68.72s)]
*  effort to curate the optics of Trump's recent visit, including handpicking soldiers for the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=77.12s)]
*  audience based on political leanings and physical appearance. The troops ultimately selected to be [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=83.68s)]
*  behind Trump and visible to the cameras were almost exclusively male. And then get a load of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=90.56s)]
*  this is my favorite part. This is my favorite part, given the shape of our president. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  One unit level message bluntly said, no fat soldiers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  Okay, man, everything's a reality show for this guy. Norms don't matter, rules don't matter, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=110.0s)]
*  acting like an adult and avoiding pettiness doesn't matter. And then everyone needs to look like [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=118.0s)]
*  they're out of central casting in his cabinet. I mean, are we really impressed by Kristi Noem? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=124.16s)]
*  Okay, the cost player in the administration, it's just so embarrassing. But nonetheless, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=132.48s)]
*  in the administration, it's just so embarrassing. But nonetheless, another note to the troops said, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=136.56s)]
*  if soldiers have political views that are in opposition to the current administration, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=141.04s)]
*  and they don't want to be in the audience, then they need to speak with their leadership [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=145.2s)]
*  and get swapped out. Now look, some see that as, well, the Trump administration is trying to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=151.52s)]
*  control who's in the crowd. So everyone agrees with him, everyone's loyal to him. But I'm sure [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=157.44s)]
*  there are people in the military who do not support some of what Trump is doing and don't want to be [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=162.56s)]
*  seen in the camera shot behind Trump. So maybe that's what that was about. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=166.88s)]
*  But we also know that Trump insists on loyalty. So the Trump campaign merchandise was even [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=171.6s)]
*  being sold at the base, very likely violating some pretty significant Defense Department rules. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=181.12s)]
*  This guy, man, he might be the top grifter, not just in the country, but in the world. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=188.56s)]
*  I don't know if there's been a single opportunity that he didn't use to sell merch, but [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=197.2s)]
*  these are the details. So a pop-up shop operated by 365 Campaign, a Tulsa, Oklahoma based retailer [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=201.68s)]
*  that sells pro-Trump and other conservative coded memorabilia was set up on site with campaign style [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=208.16s)]
*  merchandise on Army property. Soldiers were seen purchasing clothing and tchotchkes, including [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=215.04s)]
*  Make America Great Again, chain necklaces, to faux credit cards labeled white privilege cards, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=221.84s)]
*  Trump's everything. Cool, cool, total clown show. To be clear, it is a violation of Pentagon policies [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=232.08s)]
*  to engage in political activity while in uniform. And I think that's a good rule, that's an important [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=243.6s)]
*  rule, because the military is not supposed to be a political body. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=248.4s)]
*  But it didn't really seem to stop the soldiers at the speech or during Trump's speech from basically [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=253.44s)]
*  booing former presidents and of course cheering for current president Donald Trump. In addition [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=258.16s)]
*  to the Fort Bragg speech, this weekend Trump will celebrate his birthday, of course, with a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=264.8s)]
*  giant military parade. And that's basically theoretically meant to honor the Army. It's their [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=270.48s)]
*  250th anniversary. I'm skeptical that that's the real reason why Trump wants to have a military [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=277.2s)]
*  parade. If you can remember, he wanted a military parade in his first term, but that got shot down. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=283.92s)]
*  Anyway, Graham Parsons, who's a former professor at West Point and Atlantic writer Tom Nichols, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=288.8s)]
*  explain why Trump's effort to politicize the military is such a big deal. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=295.12s)]
*  What does all of this say to you about the long standing line between the military and partisan [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=298.8s)]
*  politics? It's in grave danger. I really can't overstate how disgusting that event was. By [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  politicizing the military, you're sending a message to the troops and to the American public [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=313.68s)]
*  that the military is an ally of this narrow political faction that Trump embodies. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=320.88000000000005s)]
*  He loves the idea that the military is also his personal muscle, that it's his personal security [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=326.96s)]
*  force to be used at will, which is really what's going on in Los Angeles. What he's doing in Los [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=332.88s)]
*  Angeles isn't really about Los Angeles. It's about setting up the idea and getting people [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  used to the idea that Donald Trump can bypass your local community, your state, your county [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=343.84s)]
*  governments, and just put troops in your streets anytime he feels like it. Because he's the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=350.32s)]
*  president and these people in uniform are his personal security force. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=355.6s)]
*  I think that's spot on, right? And so I actually can't stand when people [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  make Trump out to be an idiot, because I don't think he's an idiot. I actually think he's very [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  strategic in his thinking. And I think what we're seeing on our streets right now is a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=373.6s)]
*  perfect example of that. When you underestimate someone's strategic thinking or intelligence, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  you're the one who suffers from it, okay? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=386.56s)]
*  So let me explain what I mean. What you just heard, the last individual you just heard speak [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  in that video is totally spot on. What Trump did is he utilized the one area in which he still enjoyed [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=393.68s)]
*  quite a bit of favorability among the American people, and that's on immigration. And so by [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=401.68s)]
*  deploying 700 Marines to Los Angeles, which was totally unnecessary, he is normalizing the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=408.08s)]
*  deployment of US soldiers on US soil. And that is terrifying, especially when you couple it with [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=416.08s)]
*  this story, where he's basically demanding the military's loyalty to him and his ideology. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=424.96s)]
*  So luckily, there are some in the military who are speaking out against this. Military leadership [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=432.08s)]
*  is getting slammed for their failure to uphold ethics standards. Risa Brooks, an expert of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=439.04s)]
*  civil-military relations at Marquette University says this. What I think is so remarkable about [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=445.44s)]
*  BRAG is that it's really a breakdown on the military side. It shows it's possible that the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=450.72s)]
*  military's professional ethics could fail. Well, Risa, yeah, yeah, yeah, Risa. Honestly, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=457.92s)]
*  this isn't the first time. It's just that these violations happened in other countries. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=466.48s)]
*  Now they're happening here, which we've been warning about, but okay. But people within the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=472.0s)]
*  military are concerned too. One commander at Fort Bragg said this. This has been a bad week for the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=479.6s)]
*  army, for anyone who cares about us being a neutral institution. This was shameful. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=487.44s)]
*  I don't expect anything to come out of it, but I hope maybe we can learn from it long term. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=494.24s)]
*  Well, to this commander, I am pretty much done with hoping for anything good to come from the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=502.4s)]
*  federal government at this point. Certainly under the leadership of Donald Trump, considering how [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=509.68s)]
*  effortlessly he decided to deploy US military to Los Angeles when it was completely unnecessary [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=514.9599999999999s)]
*  to do so. Scary times we're living in, but hey, at least there were no fat soldiers behind Trump. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb09aZ-s0zw&t=521.12s)]
