"Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist lawmaker, is on pace to win the Democratic primary for New York City mayor ‚Äî a seismic shift in what normally would have been a sleepy reelection for the incumbent, Eric Adams, and one that involved toppling Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs political comeback.
Cuomo conceded defeat late Tuesday night and said he called to congratulate Mamdani."

# Mamdani DOMINATES NYC Mayoral Primary
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA)
*  Thank you, my friends. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=0.0s)]
*  33-year-old assemblyman Zoran Mamdani, a social media savvy, self-described democratic socialist, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=2.96s)]
*  has ridden a wave of anti-establishment sentiment to a shocking victory. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=10.0s)]
*  I will be your Democratic nominee for the mayor of New York City. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=14.8s)]
*  Last night, Cuomo said he called Mamdani to congratulate him. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=20.16s)]
*  Tonight is his night. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=24.0s)]
*  He deserved it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=26.76s)]
*  He won. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=28.76s)]
*  Well, you heard that correctly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=32.04s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani has shocked the democratic establishment to its core by beating Andrew [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=33.24s)]
*  Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=39.64s)]
*  Now, despite being smeared as anti-Semitic, a communist by Republicans and Democrats alike, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=43.2s)]
*  by the way, Mamdani managed to break through all of that noise to unite a pretty broad [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  coalition of New Yorkers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=56.56s)]
*  And we'll get into what that coalition looks like in just a minute. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=58.36s)]
*  But he also was able to break through to, look, we'll get into a bit of Zoran Mamdani's, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=62.28s)]
*  and his name is really difficult to say, I'm not mispronouncing it on purpose. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=71.16s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani, we'll get into his win and how it's caused this all out panic in New [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=75.08s)]
*  York and in the democratic establishment in just a minute. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=83.48s)]
*  But first, Cenk, real quick, real concise, just one sentence, initial thoughts. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  Down goes Cuomo, down goes Cuomo, down goes Cuomo. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  Our members asked for it, including BloatedEgo on tyt.com. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=98.28s)]
*  I'm here to deliver, and it is a beautiful moment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=101.72000000000001s)]
*  The democratic establishment has suffered a heavy blow and more blows coming. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=104.92000000000002s)]
*  So it's a great, great moment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=110.12s)]
*  We'll dissect what's next in this race. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=111.56s)]
*  So since New York City has ranked choice voting, elections work a little differently from what [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  most Americans are used to. So bear with me as I kind of explain the process. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Mamdani's support after the first round of vote continuing will remain below 50%. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  And that means that the race will formally be decided by ranked choice [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=134.04s)]
*  votes that will be announced beginning on July 1st. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=138.12s)]
*  Now, with 93% reporting in the first round, as you can see from this graphic, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=142.04s)]
*  Mamdani was leading with 43.5% of the vote. And since he cross endorsed with Brad Lander, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=148.44s)]
*  who's a progressive who came third with 11.4% of the vote, he's predicted to benefit more than [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  Cuomo from the next round of counting. So you guys understand how that works, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  So Andrew Cuomo, who received 36.4% has already conceded, although his campaign left the door [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=166.84s)]
*  open for a November run on a different party line, which has happened before. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=172.6s)]
*  I believe that happened in a local election in Buffalo, New York, which was pretty gross [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=179.0s)]
*  and it totally worked. So I would not be surprised if Cuomo tried this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=184.36s)]
*  But Mamdani ran on an economically progressive platform. He did not hide the fact that he [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  identifies as a democratic socialist and he has promoted policies including a rent freeze on all [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=193.56s)]
*  stabilized tenants, tripling the city's production of affordable union built rent stabilized homes, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=200.28s)]
*  making city buses free, raising taxes on the top 1% of earners and corporations, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=207.96s)]
*  and creating a network of city owned grocery stores. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=214.36s)]
*  So he wants grocery stores to be publicly owned instead of privately owned. Now, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=217.8s)]
*  here's an outspoken critic. He is an outspoken critic of Israel's genocide in Gaza. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=221.48s)]
*  He's also very critical of Cuomo. But look, Cuomo's supporters repeatedly accused him of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=229.16s)]
*  being anti-Semitic specifically because he's been rightly critical of Israel's conduct. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  And you might have seen there was this viral video featuring a woman confronting him for [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  being anti-Semitic. And I gotta say the way he handled that was so good. He didn't lose his [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=247.48s)]
*  patience. He was calm. He explained himself. And look, he's unfortunately being accused of the same [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  thing that we get accused of when we tell the truth and show you evidence of what's happening [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=259.32s)]
*  in Gaza. Now, his supporters, Cuomo supporters, I should say, included Bill Clinton, Mike Bloomberg, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  Jim Clyburn, and Richie Torres, which tells you everything you need to know about the type of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=271.24s)]
*  people who wanted Cuomo to win over Mamdani. And amazingly, Politico found that more than 40% [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=276.04s)]
*  of Cuomo's top endorsements by elected officials have come from people who publicly condemned him [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=281.48s)]
*  four years ago. It's amazing. Now, just real quick, if you don't remember, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  Cuomo not only has been credibly accused of gross sexual misconduct by people who worked for him in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=292.04s)]
*  the past, but he also made the horrible decision to send elderly people who still had COVID [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=299.48s)]
*  back to nursing homes where the virus continued to spread and a lot of elderly people died as [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  a result. I think that story is something that people should not forget about because he messed [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=314.68s)]
*  with people's lives and that wasn't okay. I know that these salacious stories tend to get more [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=320.04s)]
*  attention. And by the way, sexual misconduct should absolutely get the attention, but that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=325.16s)]
*  doesn't mean you should forget about the other horrible things that Cuomo did as a leader, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=330.12s)]
*  as the former mayor of New York City. Now, yeah, so Cenk, I know you're chomping at the bit, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=333.8s)]
*  but I'm gonna make you wait for just one more second. Who voted for Mamdani? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  If you look at the borough level votes, he beat Cuomo in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=343.72s)]
*  while Cuomo came out ahead in the Bronx. And Staten Island, which that doesn't really surprise [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=349.56s)]
*  me, Staten Island tends to be a little more conservative. But in the Bronx, which of course [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  is represented by AOC, I think, and this is just my guess, there has been more of a concern [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=360.6s)]
*  about disorder and crime and stuff like that in that area. So maybe some of Mamdani's policies [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=369.0s)]
*  pertains to policing, turn them off. That's just my guess. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  But his coalition, again, largely consisted of a broad range of people, including white, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  Asian, and Latino voters in economically and racially diverse areas of the city. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  Notably, he struggled more in middle class, predominantly black areas in the Bronx and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  southeast Queens, where Cuomo retained strong support from his years as governor. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=397.24s)]
*  Cuomo also, that's right, he was governor, my bad, I made a mistake earlier. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  So he was governor. Cuomo also won islands of support on affluent, democratic strongholds [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=408.44s)]
*  like the Upper West and East sides of Manhattan, and in Orthodox Jewish enclaves in Brooklyn, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=415.8s)]
*  where Mamdani's views on Israel alienated some voters. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=421.72s)]
*  And in a conversation on the breaking points slash drop site live stream last night, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  Mamdani communications director talked about their strategy, how they managed to win and how [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=433.16s)]
*  they even reached out to, they reached out to Trump voters? Interesting, let's see how that turned out. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=440.92s)]
*  After Donald Trump was elected and everybody was in a state of shell shock. What was this about? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=449.56s)]
*  What happened? What did we do? We said, let's just go ask people. Let's go to the hearts of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  immigrant New York. Let's go to South Richmond Hill. Let's go to Fordham Road. Let's go to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=461.0s)]
*  working class immigrant and black and brown neighborhoods that swung big for Trump and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=465.16s)]
*  just ask people, why'd you do it? And we really made a sign that said, let's talk politics. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  This was five days after the presidential election. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=475.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=477.88s)]
*  Stood on the corner and said, let's talk. And we heard again and again and again, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=478.6s)]
*  I used to have more money in my pocket. Things used to be more affordable. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=482.28s)]
*  The government is not delivering for me, but there are endless wars around the world. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=486.92s)]
*  And obviously Trump cynically and disingenuously spoke to those things. He also said cheaper [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=493.24s)]
*  prices end the wars, right? And those are the things that we heard all over the city, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=500.36s)]
*  especially in those neighborhoods. And when Zoran then said, I'm running for mayor to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=504.44s)]
*  freeze your rent, make buses fast and free, deliver universal childcare. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=508.44s)]
*  They said, I'll come back and I'll vote for you. And we are actually seeing that tonight. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=511.8s)]
*  So reaching out to people who voted for Trump seems to have worked in this situation. I could [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=514.84s)]
*  be wrong, but that was my read of it. What do you think, Cenk? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=525.08s)]
*  Yeah, look, of course it's true, but that's what people have to understand. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  Reaching out to listen to them doesn't mean that you have to agree with them on their right-wing [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=534.2800000000001s)]
*  policies. Zoran didn't agree with them on any of their right-wing policies. But that doesn't mean [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=538.2s)]
*  that you have to curse at them. That doesn't mean you don't have to talk to them. It means you [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  listen and then you go, okay, let me pitch my ideas to you based on what I heard from you. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=548.2800000000001s)]
*  And let's see if there's any intersection here. And of course there is. Everybody wants [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=553.56s)]
*  lower prices on housing and many other things that he pushed. So we're gonna do a lot of fun [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=557.4s)]
*  things here. We're gonna talk about his strategy and his substance. One of the fun things I'll [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=563.88s)]
*  tell you about is, did I know this was coming? Okay, I love predictions. I'll tell you about [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=568.52s)]
*  that in a second. But first I wanna explain that that was a communications director that you just [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=574.76s)]
*  watched for the campaign, Andrew Barnevstein. And so I think they did a wonderful, amazing job [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=578.84s)]
*  with communications. Not just in reaching out to Trump voters and seeing what they want. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  That was a part of it and a good part of it and an important part of it. But much more important [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=589.48s)]
*  was, my God, his social media, online media engagement was through the roof and he was so [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=594.52s)]
*  good at it. He was so good at the debates. So look, I'll tell you what I'm most excited about, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=599.88s)]
*  which is two things that I get out of this. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=605.9599999999999s)]
*  Number one, the more the establishment is defeated, the happier I am. So in this case, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=611.0799999999999s)]
*  we're defeating the establishment from the left. That's beautiful. And of all the people to defeat [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=618.04s)]
*  in the establishment, Andrew Cuomo, perfect, right? And for me, the thing about Andrew Cuomo [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=623.0799999999999s)]
*  that always drove me crazy is related to this race. He always looks out for his donors. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=629.24s)]
*  He's always trying to protect the status quo. And some of his top donors were real estate donors. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=635.1600000000001s)]
*  They have been historically and they were in this race. One group alone gave him $2.5 million. So [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=641.4000000000001s)]
*  the real estate industry gave him an enormous amount of money just for this small and quick [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=647.08s)]
*  mayoral race, right? And then Bloomberg gave him $8.3 million. And I love to see that being wasted. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=652.9200000000001s)]
*  So beautiful to see, right? So all of this, keep the status quo, keep the status quo, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=661.64s)]
*  didn't work. We're in a new era. We're just saying, it's okay, I'm the Democratic establishment. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=667.0799999999999s)]
*  I know what I'm doing. And just vote for me. I'm the only one who can win. Not working at [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=674.12s)]
*  all anymore. And I'm super psyched about it, right? So why do I think so, Ron? One, is it because of [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=681.0s)]
*  the district? No, and a big part of AOC's district is also in Queens. I think that a couple of things [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=687.96s)]
*  have changed demographically and culturally in New York and across the country that are, I think, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=698.52s)]
*  a little important, but then I'm gonna get to the big point. So I remember when I was involved in [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=705.4000000000001s)]
*  the just Democrat race when AOC won that historic primary also in New York, right, against Joe [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=711.96s)]
*  Crowley. And in that case, we were rooting for low voter turnout. We were trying to ambush them, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=717.88s)]
*  basically. Joe Crowley did not have as much name recognition in that district as they thought he [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=723.88s)]
*  did. And we thought low voter turnout with young, energetic progressives in the district might make [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=728.9200000000001s)]
*  a difference, and it did. And that was definitely the right strategy, by the way, run by Sherkat [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=734.36s)]
*  Chakravarti, who's currently running against Nancy Pelosi in a primary. If he takes her out, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=738.36s)]
*  good night, Irene. The establishment is wiped out. So go check out Sherkat's campaign and make sure [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=744.28s)]
*  you're helping there. He could be the next Zoran Mamdani. Okay, so now though, those young [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=750.6800000000001s)]
*  progressives are a massive force in New York. We didn't need low voter turnout. This was a higher [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=757.64s)]
*  voter turnout election than historically than in the last couple of decades. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=764.2s)]
*  And it helped Mamdani, did not hurt Mamdani. That means momentum is on our side, okay? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=770.6s)]
*  So now when you get to the substance of it, okay, now here's where it gets a little interesting. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  Because when I look at the particular policies that he pushed, I'm so curious about them, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=780.6s)]
*  because they're not the ones I would have picked. Be honest with you guys, right? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=788.36s)]
*  And so, but number one, their change as opposed to the status quo. So great, let's try them. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=792.92s)]
*  Let's try them and see what happens, right? And I'm genuinely curious to see, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=801.4s)]
*  can he really raise corporate taxes by that much in New York? Will some of them leave or will all [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=806.2s)]
*  of them stay and then thereby disprove the mythology that they're all going to leave? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=811.0s)]
*  So I'm very excited about that one. I like that one and I'm curious to see what rate of increase [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=815.4s)]
*  is going to be sustainable, right? That's gonna work, keep the companies there and [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=822.2s)]
*  produce the revenue that we need. He would not back off of the BDS movement against Israel. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=827.0s)]
*  His strength there was through the roof. I loved it. Okay, so that's my favorite policy that he's [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=834.12s)]
*  got. I know it doesn't relate much to New York, but so rent control of historically [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=840.44s)]
*  think it as problems in the market. But we've got to try to lower the housing prices somehow. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=846.44s)]
*  Nationally, I think it's by banning private equity from buying residential real estate. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=851.7199999999999s)]
*  That's in our populist playing. In a city, I get why they wanna do a rent control freeze. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=855.4s)]
*  I'm a little worried about the market dynamics there, but I think it's worth trying to see how [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=860.68s)]
*  it goes. Same thing for school buses, same for free childcare. Can they really do it? Does that make a [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=865.4799999999999s)]
*  big difference? And then finally on defund the police, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=871.3199999999999s)]
*  it has a program to move some of the funding to community service programs. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=875.16s)]
*  Again, I'm very curious, is that going to work? Could it lower crime? Does it increase crime? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=880.12s)]
*  Obviously, we will give you an honest assessment of that at some point. And we're not gonna play [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=884.84s)]
*  around with the numbers and tell you worked if it didn't work or tell you that it didn't work if it [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=889.64s)]
*  did work, right? So we're gonna be fair and honest about that. And I wanna see him try these things [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=893.9599999999999s)]
*  cuz change is so much better than not changing. And he's trying to address these folks. And that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=899.48s)]
*  gets to my most important point, which is, guys, we've been asking for change the whole time. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  And would I have picked a different policy than government run grocery stores? Definitely, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=912.84s)]
*  but maybe I wouldn't have won, right? So he picked these policies, they voted for him. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=921.16s)]
*  So let's give him a shot to run these policies and see if they're brilliant, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=926.6800000000001s)]
*  see if they totally work. And did I see this coming in? No, I didn't, because I was used to [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=930.76s)]
*  the AOC era where you had to have low voter turnout. And if you had the establishment show [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=937.4s)]
*  up in a race this big, that they were gonna, especially with the ads and stuff, I have seen [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=942.92s)]
*  them overwhelm us time and time again. And Zoran was not running on like mild policies. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=947.64s)]
*  He was running on pretty aggressively socialist policies. But I think that his strength, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=956.12s)]
*  whether the New Yorkers agree with those policies, etc., we're gonna find out as we go along. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=963.96s)]
*  But the fact that he was so strong about it and said, yeah, that's right, I'm not backing off my [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=969.08s)]
*  position on Israel, and I'm not backing off any of these policies. That was wonderful to see on [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=974.84s)]
*  the right strategy. Okay, I need to jump in, especially when you say you didn't expect this [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=980.92s)]
*  to be the outcome of the race. Well, it turns out that Andrew Cuomo's top donor also didn't [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=986.8399999999999s)]
*  expect this to be the outcome. And this is amazing. So just bear with me as I read this, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=992.92s)]
*  this was reported by the New York Times. As donors try to assess their next moves in the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=997.64s)]
*  mayoral race, one of the biggest donors to Andrew Cuomo's super PAC, the investor Mark Gorton, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1003.4799999999999s)]
*  said he is likely to back Mamdani. That is because of the support that Mamdani had gotten [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1010.76s)]
*  from Brad Lander, who Gorton said he ranked first. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1018.76s)]
*  I feel like people misunderstood my $250,000 for Cuomo for real enthusiasm, he said in an interview. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1023.08s)]
*  It was basically, looks like Cuomo is coming back. We don't wanna be shut out. Let's try to get on [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1030.28s)]
*  his good side. That's kind of how things work with Cuomo. It's sad political pragmatism. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1037.88s)]
*  I wish we lived in a world where those sort of things were not useful things to do. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1044.7600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's so telling. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1049.64s)]
*  It's amazing. First of all, I look forward to giving somebody $250,000 just because I'm not [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1053.0s)]
*  enthusiastic about them. Wow, what a stunning amount of money to give when you're not enthusiastic. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1059.88s)]
*  Okay, so I hope he's enthusiastic about Mamdani, cuz that might be a decent number. But look at [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1066.68s)]
*  the kind of corruption that Andrew Cuomo ran. And this is very true of Cuomo and the Clintons. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1072.52s)]
*  They would make a list, and if you didn't bribe them, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1078.76s)]
*  And if you did bribe them, then you were on the good guy list, and you were gonna get a goodie, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1083.72s)]
*  not from Cuomo, but from the taxpayers. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1088.1200000000001s)]
*  Isn't that extortion? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1090.76s)]
*  Of course it is. I mean, but it's bribery, it's extortion, it's all these things. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1093.3999999999999s)]
*  So gross. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1096.9199999999998s)]
*  But the Supreme Court made it all legal. So they're like, it is a campaign contribution. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1097.8799999999999s)]
*  I am speaking to you. So look, it's interesting how quickly Cuomo's donors have given up, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1102.6s)]
*  how quickly Cuomo gave up. Cuz technically Mamdani hasn't won yet. He's at 43.6, he's gotta get to 50 [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1108.9199999999998s)]
*  so that this is the only round of voting, right? And we think he's gonna get to 50 [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1117.08s)]
*  because of the Lander votes and maybe others. But man, Cuomo was like, forget it, I give up right [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1122.68s)]
*  away, okay, which is great to see. But don't get too excited about that. Anna's definitely [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1127.56s)]
*  right about that race in upstate New York and how the establishment always comes back. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1132.84s)]
*  And not only in this case, you have the pro status quo, pro corporate, pro real estate, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1138.28s)]
*  pro donor community that is gonna come in like a bulldozer into the general election race. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1144.04s)]
*  But you also have the Israel first community that's gonna come in, okay? And I'm super proud of the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1152.2s)]
*  Jewish community in New York that was not shaken by the false accusations of anti-Semitism. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1159.0s)]
*  There's a million Jewish Americans in New York, okay? And a Muslim American just won [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1165.0s)]
*  the Democratic primary in that city. So love you guys, way to stay strong, way to all be Americans [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1172.2s)]
*  and not buy into the gaslighting and the propaganda. But they're gonna be back in [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1179.48s)]
*  the general election and it is going to be on steroids when the neocons, etc. hit Mamdani. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1185.0s)]
*  A final thing that I'll say about Mamdani's win and the fact that he appears poised to win [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1192.04s)]
*  in the end of this election cycle. He front loaded the economic policies, okay? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1198.52s)]
*  He sure would comment on some of the social issues in the country. Obviously, he commented on foreign [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1205.6399999999999s)]
*  policy as well as it pertains to what's happening in the Middle East. However, he front loaded [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1211.56s)]
*  economic policies and that's what matters to most Americans, especially in a city like New York [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1216.6000000000001s)]
*  where the cost of living is astronomical. And reaching out to people who voted differently, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1224.3600000000001s)]
*  who didn't vote for Democrats, who voted for Trump in the last election cycle is so important. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1230.44s)]
*  Because even if you can't persuade them, you at least get an understanding of where that base is [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1235.0s)]
*  at. What it is about Trump that persuaded them to vote for a man like that. And again, for everyone [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1241.08s)]
*  who denies that Trump's faux economic populism is what persuaded people to support him. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1247.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear that in reaching out to these Trump voters and talking about the economic [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1254.6799999999998s)]
*  policies that Mamdani wants to champion, who's able to bring some people over onto his side. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1261.32s)]
*  And so that's how you win. It reminds me of what Trump did in the last presidential election [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1266.6s)]
*  when he spoke before a conference of libertarians who booed him. They totally booed him. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1270.76s)]
*  Everyone on the left was clowning on him. But I saw it differently because to me that was Trump [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1276.6s)]
*  going into hostile territory, reaching out to voters and trying to make his case. That's how [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1282.68s)]
*  you win. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1287.96s)]
*  but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1WHLrKnMtA&t=1292.92s)]
