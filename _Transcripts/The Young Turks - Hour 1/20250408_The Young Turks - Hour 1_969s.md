"PETER NAVARRO ON ELON MUSK:

‚ÄúWe all understand in the White House (and the American people understand) that Elon's a car manufacturer. But he's not a car manufacturer ‚Äî He's a car assembler. 

In many cases, if you go to his Texas plant, a good part of the engines that he gets (which in the EV case are the batteries) come from Japan and come from China. The electronics come from Taiwan... "

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Elon Musk Absolutely DEBASES Peter Navarro
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc)
*  It just seems like I'm getting my [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=0.0s)]
*  head around the all the prima [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=2.04s)]
*  approach. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  I'm not condemning it because I'm [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=4.3s)]
*  not a trade expert, but I still at [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=5.9s)]
*  some point and understand that you [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=7.5s)]
*  are the trade rep. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=9.3s)]
*  So if you own this decision that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=10.34s)]
*  I'll look to you to figure out if [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=11.94s)]
*  we're going to be successful. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=13.5s)]
*  If you don't on the decision, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=16.02s)]
*  I'm just trying to figure out whose [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=17.32s)]
*  throat I get to choke if it's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=18.82s)]
*  wrong. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=19.92s)]
*  Trump advisor Peter Navarro, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=22.34s)]
*  according to Elon Musk, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  that's the person who Senator Tom [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  Tillish should choke out if the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=26.7s)]
*  Trump tariff policies end up [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=28.4s)]
*  failing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=30.24s)]
*  Because the internal battle [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=31.4s)]
*  between Elon Musk and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=33.28s)]
*  Trump advisor Peter Navarro, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=34.72s)]
*  escalated even more today with Elon [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=36.76s)]
*  basically slinging insults all over [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=39.06s)]
*  his platform X and we're going to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=41.4s)]
*  get to that in just a minute. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  But Cenk, dirty, dirty, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=45.099999999999994s)]
*  I thought we were the only ones [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=46.36s)]
*  who were dealing with infighting [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=47.86s)]
*  on X, but no. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=49.44s)]
*  So look, as we predicted and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=51.4s)]
*  everybody said wasn't going to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  happen, there's massive infighting, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=55.4s)]
*  so Elon Musk versus Peter Navarro. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=58.38s)]
*  I think it's interesting who's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  right, but that's a different [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=62.14s)]
*  question. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=63.94s)]
*  The thing we're asking in the live [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=64.74s)]
*  chat, watch the show by the way, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=66.34s)]
*  every day at 6 o'clock Eastern, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  is who's going to win? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=69.8s)]
*  Who's Trump going to side with [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=71.66s)]
*  Elon Musk or Peter Navarro? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=73.08s)]
*  For now it's been Navarro, but [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=75.14s)]
*  Elon's trying to make a comeback, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=76.7s)]
*  we're going to tell you all about [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=78.38s)]
*  it, and I asked the question on X, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=80.0s)]
*  who's more right on tariffs? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=82.02s)]
*  Because Elon and Trump disagree, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=83.74s)]
*  and I'll tell you which way people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=85.96s)]
*  are voting, Musk or Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=88.16s)]
*  So all of this is super [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=90.08s)]
*  interesting, but let's tell you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=91.2s)]
*  about the fight first. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=92.66s)]
*  So look, Musk began attacking [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=93.6s)]
*  Peter Navarro, who is very much an [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  evangelist when it comes to tariffs. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=97.88s)]
*  He's the real deal in regard to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=100.36s)]
*  actually supporting the idea of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=102.32s)]
*  implementing these steep tariffs on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=104.32s)]
*  our trade partners. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=106.52s)]
*  I don't think he's making it up, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=107.84s)]
*  he's got a long history of being [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=109.56s)]
*  supportive of tariffs. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=111.12s)]
*  Now, Elon Musk, not a fan of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=112.16s)]
*  tariffs, but he's a big fan of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=113.6s)]
*  tariffs, I think for obvious [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=115.14s)]
*  reasons. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=116.98s)]
*  First of all, after Trump announced [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=117.78s)]
*  his tariff policy during Liberation [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=119.98s)]
*  Day, stocks plummeted, Elon Musk's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=122.26s)]
*  wealth dropped by the billions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=124.58000000000001s)]
*  And on top of that, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=127.34s)]
*  his business really does require [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=128.26s)]
*  parts, for instance, from foreign [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=130.12s)]
*  manufacturers in order to assemble [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  Teslas, even here in the United [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=134.38s)]
*  States. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=136.22s)]
*  If you slap a tariff onto those car [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=137.26s)]
*  parts, obviously it's going to cut [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=138.94s)]
*  into Tesla's profits, so [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=140.78s)]
*  he hates the tariffs. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=142.22s)]
*  Now, Navarro, somewhat to his [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=143.72s)]
*  credit, actually has not been [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  attacking Elon Musk the same way. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=147.66s)]
*  His jobs have been a little more [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=150.04s)]
*  subtle. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=151.48s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=152.32s)]
*  When it comes to tariffs and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  trade, we all understand in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  the White House and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=157.72s)]
*  the American people understand that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=158.7s)]
*  Elon's a car manufacturer, but [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  he's not a car manufacturer, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=162.72s)]
*  he's a car assembler in many cases. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=164.6s)]
*  If you go to his Texas plant, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  a good part of the engines that he [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=169.72s)]
*  gets, which in the EV case is the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=172.98s)]
*  batteries come from Japan and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  come from China. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  The electronics come from Taiwan, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=178.66s)]
*  the tires come. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=181.1s)]
*  What we want, and the difference is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=182.62s)]
*  in our thinking and Elon's on this, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=185.14s)]
*  we want the cars manufactured here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=187.73999999999998s)]
*  Okay, so he basically says, look, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk's got his own interests. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=195.1s)]
*  Here's what the Trump [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=196.82s)]
*  administration wants to do, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=197.66s)]
*  which is sweet. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Peter Navarro appears to be [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=199.74s)]
*  under the assumption that Trump and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  the administration in general is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=203.52s)]
*  actually going to implement [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=205.28s)]
*  permanent tariffs against our trade [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=206.84s)]
*  partners when really this is a ploy [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=208.76s)]
*  to renegotiate trade deals. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=210.6s)]
*  And honestly, nothing more. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=212.24s)]
*  That's the way I see it so far, but [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=213.96s)]
*  I'll be happy to be proven wrong, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=215.72s)]
*  I guess. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=217.44s)]
*  We'll wait and see what happens. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=218.24s)]
*  Now, Elon Musk responded to that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  clip that we just showed you with, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=221.6s)]
*  Navarro is truly a moron. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=223.84s)]
*  What he says here is demonstrably [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=226.52s)]
*  false. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=229.16s)]
*  And then he says, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=230.61999999999998s)]
*  Tesla has the most American made [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=231.7s)]
*  cars, Navarro is dumber than [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=233.94s)]
*  a sack of bricks. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=236.22s)]
*  Now look, it is true. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  Tesla, out of all the car companies [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=239.22s)]
*  is, I think one of two that mostly [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=242.1s)]
*  manufactures their vehicles here [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=244.7s)]
*  domestically, and that's admirable. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  I think that is a good thing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=250.54s)]
*  I think Elon Musk deserves some [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=252.78s)]
*  credit there, but [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  he does use foreign made parts. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  And so the tariffs would, of course, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=257.74s)]
*  hurt his business. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=259.52s)]
*  Now, Cenk, real quick, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=261.52s)]
*  I want to kind of go to you to get [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=263.08s)]
*  your thoughts on what Musk says [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=264.84s)]
*  about Navarro being completely [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=266.52s)]
*  wrong. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=268.28s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=268.8s)]
*  Yeah, so God, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=270.12s)]
*  this is so wonderfully nuanced. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=271.12s)]
*  I know some others don't like [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=273.16s)]
*  nuance, I love nuance. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=274.88s)]
*  Me too. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=276.32s)]
*  So first off, can tariffs work? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=276.92s)]
*  Navarro is generally right about [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=281.04s)]
*  that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=282.4s)]
*  Can nuclear tariffs like the one [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=282.68s)]
*  Navarro drew up here work? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=284.36s)]
*  No, I don't think he can. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=286.04s)]
*  Is Elon Musk concerned about this [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=287.46s)]
*  because he has some of his car [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=289.54s)]
*  parts outside the country and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=291.36s)]
*  these tariffs affect him? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=293.06s)]
*  Yes, Navarro's right about that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=294.46s)]
*  But is our Teslas, in a sense, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=296.58s)]
*  the most American made cars? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=298.62s)]
*  Yes, and Elon is right about that, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=301.14s)]
*  and Navarro's wrong about that, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=303.34s)]
*  right? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=305.42s)]
*  So it's not clear cut, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=306.06s)]
*  it's not black and white, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=307.58s)]
*  it's not good guys, bad guys, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=309.26s)]
*  in that sense. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=311.18s)]
*  I happen to disagree with both of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=312.3s)]
*  them overall politically. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=314.3s)]
*  I think on tariffs, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=316.64s)]
*  Elon is more correct. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=317.56s)]
*  But Navarro's not wrong to point [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=319.44s)]
*  out, hey, Elon's got skin in [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=321.32s)]
*  this game, this cost him billions [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=323.08s)]
*  of dollars, that's why he's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=325.04s)]
*  opposed to it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=326.68s)]
*  So in a sense, they're both right [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=327.48s)]
*  and they're both wrong, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=328.92s)]
*  depending on which exact question [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=330.0s)]
*  you're asking. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=331.68s)]
*  Now let's put that second post from [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=332.8s)]
*  Elon back up because I want you to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=335.56s)]
*  notice one of the hashtags. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=338.12s)]
*  So one of the hashtags is, or [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=340.36s)]
*  he tagged, I should say. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=343.2s)]
*  I find regards, okay? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=346.26s)]
*  It's a slur, he uses a slur. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=349.1s)]
*  And so he's tagging them on this [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=351.1s)]
*  post about Navarro. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=353.54s)]
*  Mario Nafal then posted, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=355.42s)]
*  Tesla exposes Navarro live, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=357.46s)]

*  look, in response to Musk calling [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=371.22s)]
*  Peter Navarro dumber than a sack of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=373.48s)]

*  statement, she even waited on it [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=389.8s)]

*  press conference today. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's take a quick look at that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  Musk actually referred to Navarro [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  today as being quote, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=398.56s)]
*  dumber than a sack of bricks. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=399.64000000000004s)]
*  Or is the administration, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=401.48s)]
*  the president all concerned that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=403.12s)]
*  this is maybe impacting the public's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=404.94s)]
*  understanding of these tariffs that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=406.82s)]

*  on it? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=410.18s)]
*  No, look, these are obviously two [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=410.74s)]
*  individuals who have very different [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=412.58000000000004s)]

*  And I think it also speaks to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=425.14s)]
*  the president's willingness to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=426.70000000000005s)]
*  hear from all sides. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=428.54s)]

*  levels of this government in this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=431.42s)]

*  But the president takes all [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=436.56s)]
*  opinions in mind and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=438.0s)]
*  then he makes the best decision [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=439.08s)]
*  based on the best interests of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  the American public. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=442.2s)]
*  So people are losing their minds [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=444.84s)]
*  about that because she said boys [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=446.2s)]
*  will be boys. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=447.64s)]
*  I actually like that it's all out [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=449.96s)]
*  in the open, it's good content. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=451.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I could nitpick and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=453.44s)]
*  go I don't like that, whatever, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=455.47999999999996s)]
*  right, etc. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=457.47999999999996s)]
*  But overall, no, no, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=458.32s)]
*  I totally agree with that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=459.64s)]

*  publicly saying, hey, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=463.62s)]
*  I believe this and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=465.06s)]
*  the other one believes that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=465.98s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=467.53999999999996s)]
*  we're both advising the president. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=468.14s)]
*  That's not such a bad thing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=470.18s)]
*  Democrats bury all disagreement and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=471.7s)]
*  then they come out and say, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=473.82s)]
*  you have to listen to whatever [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=475.34s)]
*  the Democratic leader said on [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=477.06s)]
*  their unity. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=479.02s)]
*  Everybody obey and comply, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=480.38s)]
*  no one's allowed to disagree. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=481.78s)]
*  Well, and by the way, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=483.58s)]
*  the right wing was famous for [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=484.58s)]
*  that for a long, long time, right? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=485.94s)]
*  So the fact that these guys [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  actually do disagree and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=489.18s)]
*  they're both advising, yeah, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=490.09999999999997s)]
*  I think that is a good thing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=491.71999999999997s)]
*  And at least he's hearing both [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=493.4s)]
*  sides, so not guilty on that one. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=494.84s)]
*  Being open to dissent is a good [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=496.56s)]
*  thing within an administration and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=498.32s)]
*  within a party, if you ask me. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=500.46s)]
*  So just, this is a bit of a tangent, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=502.32s)]
*  I apologize, but just think about [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=504.2s)]
*  what happened in the lead up to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=505.96s)]
*  the presidential election in 2024. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=507.52s)]
*  You have all these Democrats who [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=509.64s)]
*  are close to Biden who were fully [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  aware of his mental decline. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=512.54s)]
*  But they're so afraid to speak out [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=514.2s)]
*  against one of their own that they [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=515.96s)]
*  just kind of go along with it until [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=517.6s)]
*  it was too late. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=519.2s)]
*  Okay, Representative Clyburn, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=521.36s)]
*  according to that book Fight that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  just came out, I've been reading it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=524.38s)]
*  He was invited to allegedly dozens [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=526.74s)]
*  of swanky debate watch parties that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=528.74s)]
*  he turned down because he knew [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=530.74s)]
*  about Biden's mental decline and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=532.54s)]
*  he wanted to watch the debate alone [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=534.54s)]
*  in case he needed to cry. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=536.78s)]
*  My God, but think about that, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=538.7s)]
*  guys, think about that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=540.26s)]
*  Because that means Clyburn, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=541.62s)]
*  who's actually one of the worst [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=543.12s)]
*  people in American politics, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=544.7s)]
*  who's the most corporate, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=546.38s)]
*  I can go on and on. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=547.9s)]
*  I can go on and on. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=549.04s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=549.92s)]
*  has helped Republicans more than [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=550.64s)]
*  any other Democrat, gave them extra [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=552.3s)]
*  seats in South Carolina to protect [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=554.16s)]
*  his own seat. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=555.96s)]
*  He's such a terrible guy, okay? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=557.04s)]
*  And was the number one opponent of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=559.16s)]
*  Nina Turner and Bernie Sanders, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=560.96s)]
*  etc. So Clyburn knew definitively [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=562.6999999999999s)]
*  that Biden had dementia and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=564.84s)]
*  was in such terrible shape that the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=566.68s)]
*  debate was going to be a disaster. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=569.02s)]
*  But meanwhile, publicly before and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=571.12s)]
*  after the debate, he's like, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  no, Biden's perfectly fine. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=575.1s)]
*  He should stay in the race and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=576.96s)]
*  be president for another four years. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=578.52s)]
*  That's the kind of liar [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=580.56s)]
*  representative Clyburn. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=581.74s)]
*  I know, but it's not just about [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=583.2s)]
*  Clyburn, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=584.44s)]
*  I'm talking about the culture [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=585.12s)]
*  within the Democratic Party that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=586.56s)]
*  led to its demise. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=588.12s)]
*  So it's good to have dissent within [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=589.16s)]
*  your party and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=591.0s)]
*  within an administration. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=591.72s)]
*  Because hopefully those fights [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=593.28s)]
*  could lead to the best possible [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=595.56s)]
*  policies or solution. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=597.52s)]
*  Jury's out when it comes to what's [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=600.0s)]
*  happening right now with [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=601.28s)]
*  the terrorist policy, obviously. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=602.12s)]
*  Now, putting that aside, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=603.72s)]
*  in response to must calling Navarro [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=605.52s)]
*  dumber than a sack of bricks, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=607.78s)]
*  you heard what White House Press [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=609.64s)]
*  Secretary Caroline Levitt had to [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=611.42s)]
*  say. Now, in one of Elon Musk's [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=613.26s)]
*  posts attacking Navarro, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=615.1s)]
*  something really interesting came [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=616.7s)]
*  up. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=618.5s)]
*  By any definition whatsoever, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=619.0s)]
*  Tesla is the most vertically [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  integrated auto manufacturer in [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=622.5s)]
*  America with the highest [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=624.26s)]
*  percentage of US content. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=625.72s)]
*  Navarro should ask the fake expert [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=627.46s)]
*  he invented, Ron Vera. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=630.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=632.34s)]
*  I love this part. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=633.86s)]
*  So what Musk is referencing at [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=635.22s)]
*  the end of that post is actually [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=637.32s)]
*  something Navarro did do. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=639.1600000000001s)]
*  He used a fictional trade expert by [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=640.96s)]
*  the name of Ron Vera, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  an anagram of his last name in his [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=645.24s)]
*  books to promote his trade policy. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=647.7600000000001s)]
*  He had like a dozen quotes. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=651.12s)]
*  Here, I'll read the rest. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=654.08s)]
*  because I love this part of [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=655.5200000000001s)]
*  the story. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=656.84s)]
*  So great. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=657.5200000000001s)]
*  Although I'm going with [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=658.0200000000001s)]
*  the pronunciation Ron Vara. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=659.08s)]
*  Who's right? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=661.0s)]
*  No one knows because he's made up. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=661.6400000000001s)]
*  Okay, he put them in real books as [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  if he had real quotes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=665.9399999999999s)]
*  So here, Ron Vara has appeared as [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=667.7399999999999s)]

*  Okay, well, by the way, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=689.54s)]
*  he said in the book that this guy [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=691.2199999999999s)]
*  has a degree in economics from [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=693.3399999999999s)]

*  Vara and not Ron Burgundy? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=711.96s)]

*  No, no, this is the hold on, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=729.34s)]

*  again. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=925.8s)]

*  with is a different question. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=929.38s)]
*  We're asking the live chat, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=930.9s)]
*  53 Navarro, 47 Elon Musk. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=933.4599999999999s)]
*  Look, I'm as flummox as you guys [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=936.18s)]
*  are, so in terms of who's he going [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=938.54s)]
*  to go with, I think that in [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=940.9799999999999s)]
*  the beginning he's going with, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=942.78s)]
*  well, we know in the beginning he's [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=944.78s)]
*  going with Navarro, not Musk, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=946.8199999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=948.7399999999999s)]
*  But I think in the end, he's going [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=949.3s)]
*  to go with the billionaires. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=950.9799999999999s)]
*  And so I think that Elon, so [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=952.54s)]
*  in the first poll, I think Elon is [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=954.06s)]
*  right about the tariffs. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=955.9799999999999s)]
*  And in the second poll, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=957.64s)]
*  the one in the live chat, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=958.72s)]
*  I think eventually, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=959.84s)]
*  Elon's side will win. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=960.86s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5-a0qw1KHc&t=962.24s)]
