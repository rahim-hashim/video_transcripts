# Pentagon Official FIRED Over Criticism Of Israel
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I)
*  A Pentagon official has just been removed from his position in the joint chiefs of staff due to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=0.0s)]
*  his criticism of Israel and his personal issues with how they're carrying out this war against [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=7.12s)]
*  Gaza. We've talked about all of this stuff, we're about to hear from him in just a second. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=15.84s)]
*  Now he had posted about this on his personal social media accounts. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=21.12s)]
*  And apparently it was so offensive that he lost his job over it. So let's talk a little bit about [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=25.28s)]
*  who this guy is. He's Colonel Nathan McCormick. According to a report from the Daily Wire and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  the Jewish News Syndicate, he was the Levant and Egypt branch chief at the joint chiefs of staff, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=36.56s)]
*  J5 planning directorate. I'm not gonna pretend like I know what that is. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Okay, he was in the Pentagon, all right? That's what he was doing. But more importantly, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=51.92s)]
*  the fact that he was in the Levant and Egypt branch, I think kind of plays a role in why he [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=56.96s)]
*  ended up getting fired for his, in my opinion, common sense criticism of how Israel's carrying [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=63.84s)]
*  out some of their military action. So McCormick, who assumed his position in June 2024, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=69.76s)]
*  had been very vocal on his opinions on Israel and Netanyahu following the October 7th attack. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=76.88s)]
*  So here's what he posted on October 11th. Okay, I agree that Israel has an absolute right [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=83.44s)]
*  to respond militarily and that civilians may legally be caught in the crossfire. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=93.12s)]
*  But you are ignoring the requirement of proportionality. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=100.0s)]
*  Israel's responses always, always, not hyperbole, disproportionately target Palestinian civilians. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=104.0s)]
*  Where's the lie? Where's the lie? First of all, he says Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=115.28s)]
*  It's not like he's one of these people who was celebrating what Hamas did, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=122.88s)]
*  didn't call them freedom fighters. But given how the IDF has conducted themselves in the past, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=127.28s)]
*  I immediately had those thoughts. The second I saw the headlines of what Hamas was doing, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, my God, they're gonna go after the civilians. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=142.24s)]
*  I mean, it's gonna give Netanyahu the perfect excuse to do what he's been doing for nearly [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=147.04s)]
*  two years now. So he posted that again on October 11th, 2023. Prior to assuming his position, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=154.8s)]
*  he tweeted other things such as, I've lately been considering whether we might be Israel's proxy [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=161.84s)]
*  and not realized it yet. I've definitely realized it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=168.96s)]
*  Our worst ally, we get literally nothing out of the partnership other than the enmity [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  of millions of people in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=180.32s)]
*  I've actually asked this question lately. In a debate I was in just recently, I'm like, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  okay, I mean, people keep saying Israel is our ally. I can see why we are considered an ally to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=190.72s)]
*  Israel. We give them $3 billion a year, just flat out, that's the default amount. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  In addition to tens of billions of dollars when they [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  decide they wanna carry out a genocide, that kind of stuff. What do we get in return? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=208.4s)]
*  Oftentimes we hear that it's Intel. Okay, what kind of Intel do we get? The kind that claims that a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=213.44s)]
*  Middle Eastern country that the Israeli government wants to topple is in possession of weapons of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  mass destruction. Is that the kind of Intel we're talking about? Okay, they can keep their Intel to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  themselves. I'm not interested in their Intel at all. Fact of the matter is we don't get much [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=229.2s)]
*  out of that relationship. And the way Israelis talk about Americans, I have to say, disgust me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=234.24s)]
*  It really does. Their entitlement, the way that they respond to or refer to Americans who do not [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=240.56s)]
*  wanna get dragged into a war with Iran, the utter disrespect. Bitch, it's my money. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=248.16s)]
*  I'm gonna say what I wanna say. Unfortunately for this guy though, he ended up getting fired for it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=256.64s)]
*  But I wanna give you some more of his criticism, cuz who knows? Maybe he said something that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=261.68s)]
*  actually was abhorrent, okay? Because I don't want Israeli civilians to be harmed, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=265.68s)]
*  even though I loathe their government. I do, I loathe their government. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=272.0s)]
*  But if he said something disgusting about Israeli civilians or wanted violence acted upon them, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=276.16s)]
*  obviously I would condemn it and say, you know what? Not a good job for you, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  you should have been fired. So let's keep reading. Let's see what else he posted. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=286.72s)]
*  The more Israel's death cult escalates towards Hezbollah, the more we will see [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=290.4s)]
*  show of force attacks like this and the 13th of April. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=297.28s)]
*  I mean, again, why is that offensive? Where is the lie? This is someone who's concerned [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=304.16s)]
*  about the blowback of Israel's actions. And the post continued while he held this [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=309.04s)]
*  position at the Pentagon. So here are some of the more recent posts that he had written back in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=316.08s)]
*  April and May of this year. So look, we can't see the full context of these tweet threads because [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=325.28s)]
*  the account has since been deleted, but we'll give you what we still have access to. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  So he writes, Steve, the self delusion in this series of tweets perfectly encapsulates the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=336.64s)]
*  problem in Israeli society. The Western states go to great lengths to avoid criticism of Israel, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=342.32s)]
*  much out of Holocaust guilt. But Israel's actions and policies deserve to be assessed critically. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=349.76s)]
*  Wow, wow, very offensive. I don't know about you guys. You might be an anti-Semite. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=356.64s)]
*  I'm kidding, obviously. I have more. Supposed democracy, Israel's actions over decades have [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=363.12s)]
*  promoted the accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Israel's self-consciousness [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=370.16s)]
*  can't abide that criticism, just like its government can survive the process of achieving peace [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=376.88000000000005s)]
*  and security. And then I'll read you one more. But Netanyahu and his Judeo supremacist cronies [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=383.6s)]
*  are determined to prolong the conflict for their own goals, either to remain in power or to annex [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  the land. Where is the lie? And why is this offensive? This is the kind of person I want [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=396.96s)]
*  working at the Pentagon. But he ends up getting fired. So his mistake, it seems, was making it [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  known that he worked at the Pentagon. So despite some attempts to anonymize his account, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=410.88s)]
*  he did a poor job in anonymizing his account. Let's just keep it real. But anyway, he has [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  repeatedly revealed his name and job title on the platform and has posted photos of himself [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=422.4s)]
*  that match his LinkedIn profile and that include his uniform name tag. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=429.28s)]
*  Guys, if you post anything online, even if you go to great lengths to make it seem like it's an [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  on, people will find out who you are. There are ways of finding out. There was a Los Angeles Times [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=441.12s)]
*  cover. It was like a photograph of the neighborhood that I love. And it was from the 1950s. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=447.92s)]
*  And these are people from the 1950s. And I'm like, I wanna find out who they were. And I found out [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=456.0s)]
*  who they were. I found out their identities. There was nothing to go off of other than this [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  is the general area they lived in. This is the 1950s. Boom, I found it. So it's just, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=467.04s)]
*  be careful with what you post online because you might think that you're doing so anonymously, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=473.20000000000005s)]
*  but if people really wanna find out, they can. So the JNS also notes his biggest no-no. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=477.6s)]
*  So other posts include descriptions of his conversations with generals in the Israeli [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=484.32000000000005s)]
*  Defense Forces, briefings from Israel's coordinator for humanitarian aid into Gaza, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  and aborted plans to send emails over the Pentagon's secret internet protocol router [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=494.56s)]
*  network for sharing classified information. Okay, I don't really care. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  But if you take a look at those posts specifically, he didn't really share much [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=506.72s)]
*  classified information. And I'm not surprised by that either. I don't think anyone had a problem [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=512.64s)]
*  with him because he shared classified information. We know why there was a problem with him. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=518.08s)]
*  He spoke up about war crimes. He spoke up critically about what Israel was carrying out. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=523.36s)]
*  You just can't do that. You're not allowed to do that. You can do that when it comes to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=528.64s)]
*  how our government here in the United States is carrying out a war. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  But God forbid, you're ever critical of the IDF or the Israeli government. So he says, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  a buddy of mine is a general in the IDF. He told me, screw the settlers. They can be Jewish [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians just like the Arab Israelis. They choose to move there illegally. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=549.28s)]
*  By the way, nice, there's an IDF soldier who says screw the settlers. The settlers are the worst. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=556.08s)]
*  Okay, these are the people who rioted when they found out that some of the Israeli prison guards [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=562.96s)]
*  who filmed themselves raping Palestinian prisoners might get investigated and punished. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=568.72s)]
*  These are like loathsome, disgusting people. Aside from running Palestinians out of their [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=575.44s)]
*  legal homes in the West Bank, aside from terrorizing them for decades, aside from the fact they steal [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=582.0s)]
*  homes, build illegal settlements. They also, of course, tried to block humanitarian aid into [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=588.16s)]
*  Gaza when the Israeli government finally relented a little bit. Just loathsome, the settlers. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=594.16s)]
*  But Nate, that was his anonymous moniker, McCormick, wrote also that it is a useful [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  diversion for the media. But I think that if Israel escalates this into an offensive against [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  Lebanon, this is probably when Israel was fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon, they are F'd. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=614.48s)]
*  And we have already told them that repeatedly. I was going to email you on SIPR last week, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=622.0s)]
*  but I didn't want to email the wrong person. Wow, he sounds reckless, super reckless. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=628.32s)]
*  Now, McCormick's profile did include a disclaimer stating that his posts do not represent the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=635.76s)]
*  position of the department. What are you doing? Why would you do that? That gives the game away, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=640.08s)]
*  but it's my opinions, it's not the opinion of the Pentagon. But still, his posts were [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=645.12s)]
*  apparently too much. So one Department of Defense contractor who interacted with McCormick told [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=650.96s)]
*  JNS, that's a publication. This is the kind of bitter oversharing I'd expect from someone who [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=657.2s)]
*  doesn't know better. But at his level and under his own name and likeness, it's mind-boggling, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=664.0s)]
*  we have enough OPSEC and public perception problems. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=670.4s)]
*  No, no, guys, the public perception problem with the Pentagon is the fact that you can't pass a [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=675.28s)]
*  single freaking audit. The problem with the Pentagon is that there are no brakes on the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=681.2s)]
*  car when it comes to aiding and abetting genocide, okay? Just stop. McCormick is like bottom, bottom, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=686.48s)]
*  bottom of the list, very bottom of the list when it comes to people who make the Pentagon look bad. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=693.84s)]
*  So he lost his job, he was fired. Don't criticize Israel apparently, there will be huge [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=699.76s)]
*  consequences for that. Just absolutely shameful, and he's right. People like to say that Israel is [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=705.76s)]
*  a vassal state of the United States, that is such a laugh. It's the other way around. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=712.88s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=717.84s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wVJCwkVX7I&t=721.0400000000001s)]
