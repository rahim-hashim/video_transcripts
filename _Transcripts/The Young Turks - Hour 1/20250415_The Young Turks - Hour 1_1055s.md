"Mohsen K. Mahdawi arrived at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Colchester, Vermont, on Monday. A Palestinian student at Columbia University, he hoped that, after 10 years in the U.S., he would pass the test to become a naturalized citizen. 

Instead, agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him and began the process to deport him to the occupied West Bank. Mahdawi, a leader of the campus protest movement against Israel‚Äôs war on Gaza, became yet another green card holder arrested and facing removal.

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# ICE Arrests Palestinian Student Leader At Columbia
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8)
*  Yesterday, US immigration and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=0.0s)]
*  customs enforcement arrested [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=2.2600000000000002s)]
*  Palestinian Columbia University [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=4.54s)]
*  student Mohsen K. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=7.0s)]
*  Madhawi for his involvement in pro [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=8.48s)]
*  Palestinian activism. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=10.66s)]
*  And he is now facing deportation [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=12.3s)]
*  back to the war torn occupied [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=14.64s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=16.72s)]
*  So just like in the case of Mahmoud [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=17.96s)]
*  Khalil, Madhawi is a green card [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=20.02s)]
*  holder who has been in the US for [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=22.06s)]
*  10 years. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  So here's this according to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=25.44s)]
*  Dropsite. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Madhawi grew up in a Palestinian [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=28.56s)]
*  refugee camp in the Israeli [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=30.72s)]
*  occupied West Bank where his [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=32.48s)]
*  childhood was shaped by [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=34.339999999999996s)]
*  the Second Intifada. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=35.78s)]
*  He experienced significant personal [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=37.68s)]
*  losses including the death of his [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  best friend during a confrontation [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=41.68s)]
*  with Israeli soldiers when he was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=43.739999999999995s)]
*  just 10 years old. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=45.66s)]
*  He later studied computer [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=46.64s)]
*  engineering at Berzion University [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=48.16s)]
*  in Palestine before enrolling at [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=50.22s)]
*  Columbia University in New York [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=52.04s)]
*  where he pursued studies and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=53.8s)]
*  philosophy at the School of General [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=55.34s)]
*  Studies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=57.3s)]
*  So it's important to reiterate [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=57.96s)]
*  here Madhawi was a green card [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=59.94s)]
*  holder. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=61.76s)]
*  He was not here on a student visa [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=62.64s)]
*  and he was actually in the process [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=64.56s)]
*  of obtaining full citizenship, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=66.54s)]
*  which ICE used to their advantage [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=68.54s)]
*  later which we'll get to in a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  second. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=72.2s)]
*  So Cenk, what are your initial [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=72.76s)]
*  thoughts on this? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=74.16s)]
*  Where do you think this is going? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=74.94s)]
*  Yeah, I know where it's going where [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=76.76s)]
*  Israel locks up everyone who [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  disagrees with them here in America. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=79.56s)]
*  So first they started with student [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=81.58s)]
*  visas, then they went to legal [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=83.8s)]
*  residents who have green cards. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=85.64s)]
*  Who have every right to be here, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=88.36s)]
*  every right to freedom of speech. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=89.96s)]
*  The Supreme Court has declared that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=91.78s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=93.69999999999999s)]
*  Well, not unless you disagree with [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=95.94s)]
*  Israel in which case you'll be [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=97.94s)]
*  whisked away by masked men. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=99.6s)]
*  And they're thinking of sending [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=102.16s)]
*  him back to the West Bank where if [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=103.8s)]
*  settlers murder him, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=105.56s)]
*  there's no chance they'll be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=106.86s)]
*  convicted. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=108.66s)]
*  They have kangaroo courts there [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=109.44s)]
*  where they have 99% acquittal rates. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=111.6s)]
*  So we're going to send this guy [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  to his death potentially. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=117.82s)]
*  Because Israel said no one should [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=120.46s)]
*  disagree with Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=123.02s)]
*  Here in America, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=125.66s)]
*  your freedom of speech, well, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=126.46s)]
*  the Supreme Court says residents [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=128.16s)]
*  aliens that are legal residents here [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=129.78s)]
*  in America have the same exact [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  rights, their freedom of speech is [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=133.1s)]
*  US citizens. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=134.98s)]
*  So if they no longer have that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=136.6s)]
*  right, we no longer have that right. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=137.98s)]
*  And we all have to bow our heads to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=140.34s)]
*  that foreign government. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=141.7s)]
*  Sorry, no, okay, keep slaughtering. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=143.18s)]
*  You haven't murdered enough [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=147.5s)]
*  Palestinian children. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=148.9s)]
*  That's what we're supposed to say? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=150.3s)]
*  No, I'm not a dog of another [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=151.86s)]
*  government, okay? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=153.34s)]
*  I don't care who the government is. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  So they're going to start keep [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=157.26s)]
*  kidnapping, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=159.18s)]
*  snatching these people off [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=160.26s)]
*  the streets so that, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=162.06s)]
*  I was about to say Joe Biden, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=163.3s)]
*  it's also true Joe Biden, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=165.02s)]
*  he didn't do this much. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  This is a whole nother level by [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=169.46s)]
*  But Joe Biden said, wait, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=170.62s)]
*  whatever Israel says, blank check, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=171.82s)]
*  blank check, blank check, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  keep slaughtering, keep slaughtering. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=174.66s)]
*  Now Trump comes in, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=176.22s)]
*  I can't believe Joe Biden's for [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=177.3s)]
*  war, me, I love war, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=178.74s)]
*  if Israel's doing it, keep slaughtering [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=179.82s)]
*  here, blank check, blank check. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  Israel, you want more because your [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=184.54s)]
*  Adelson family gave me $337 million [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=186.46s)]
*  in legalized bribes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=188.54s)]
*  Well, for that kind of money, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=190.78s)]
*  he's like, Israel, what do you need? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=191.86s)]
*  You need me to shred the US [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=193.14s)]
*  Constitution, light it on fire so [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=194.5s)]
*  that all American citizens have to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=196.38s)]
*  serve Israel and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=198.14s)]
*  no one is allowed to dissent? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=199.18s)]

*  is. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=213.02s)]
*  So now we're going to tell you more [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=213.54s)]
*  about this brother, and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=215.46s)]
*  you're going to find out even there [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=216.9s)]
*  are BS excuses of, we are not doing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=218.82s)]
*  this for Israel, we are doing it [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=220.98s)]
*  because we are so [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=222.98s)]
*  concerned about anti-Semitism. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=224.1s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=227.06s)]
*  Well, you picked the wrong guy [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=228.1s)]
*  because that guy's spoken out [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  against anti-Semitism. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=231.06s)]
*  So as you'll see here, but [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=232.42s)]
*  they don't care. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=233.7s)]
*  I think, yeah, is that they partly [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=234.82s)]
*  picked this guy, knowing he's on [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=236.82s)]
*  tape speaking out against [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=238.74s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=240.22s)]
*  So they can make it clear to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=241.86s)]
*  everyone, you see that we all know [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=243.3s)]
*  that that's a BS excuse. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=245.38s)]
*  We're telling you this is our sign [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=247.66s)]
*  to all American citizens. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=249.82s)]
*  You must bow your head to Israel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=251.74s)]
*  If you don't bow your head to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=254.54s)]
*  Israel, it doesn't matter how [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=256.02s)]
*  obvious our lies are. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=257.9s)]
*  We will arrest you, deport you, or [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=260.02s)]
*  do whatever Israel commands of us. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=261.82s)]
*  Tell them more about the case. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=263.86s)]
*  It really does feel like [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=265.82s)]
*  gaslighting and I know it's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=266.94s)]
*  obviously nothing new, but [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=268.18s)]
*  it's appalling that this foreign [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=269.5s)]
*  country has so much power and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=271.06s)]
*  influence in this country, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=272.42s)]
*  the most powerful country in [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=273.74s)]
*  the world supposedly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=275.1s)]
*  So anyway, let's get into why [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=276.14s)]
*  Madhawi was targeted. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  According to the Intercept, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=279.42s)]
*  Madhawi was one of the leaders of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=281.06s)]
*  the pro-Palestinian movement at [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=282.94s)]
*  Columbia University following [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=284.86s)]
*  the October 7th attacks. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  So here's a reporting, it says, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=288.14s)]
*  in December 2023, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=289.94s)]
*  Madhawi asked Columbia professor [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=291.06s)]
*  David I, a controversial pro-Israel [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=293.1s)]
*  figure at the school to go get some [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=295.34s)]
*  coffee. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=297.38s)]
*  The two met, but [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=298.22s)]
*  Madhawi later said that David I [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=299.18s)]
*  left in the middle of the coffee. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=300.94s)]
*  Less than two months after [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=303.26s)]
*  the meeting, David I posted a video [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=304.82s)]
*  of Madhawi to Twitter in a thread [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=306.98s)]
*  characterizing him and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=308.86s)]
*  other protest organizers as [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=310.42s)]
*  anti-Semitic and pro-Hamas. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  So here is that video and tweet, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=314.66s)]
*  take a look. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  And because there's nothing, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=317.98s)]
*  nothing more honorable than fighting [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  for a noble cause, for freedom, for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=323.82000000000005s)]
*  humanity, and for justice. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=327.26000000000005s)]
*  So Madhawi also appeared on [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=329.74s)]
*  a December 2023 edition of 60 [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=332.14000000000004s)]
*  minutes to discuss anti-Semitism [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=335.1s)]
*  on college campuses. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=338.42s)]
*  So criticizing Columbia's previous [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=340.86s)]
*  president made Madhawi a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=343.3s)]
*  So criticizing Columbia's previous [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  president, Manoush Shafik's [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  response to the attacks and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=348.72s)]
*  stating pro-Israel factions were [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  trying to silence those who [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  were protesting the genocide. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=353.92s)]
*  But to be clear, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=355.68s)]
*  he was not anti-Israel. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=356.68s)]
*  He continuously emphasized empathy [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=358.36s)]
*  and dialogue as, quote, pathways to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=360.76000000000005s)]
*  justice and peace, per the drop [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=362.92s)]
*  site. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=364.76000000000005s)]
*  So Madhawi recalled during a walk [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=365.32000000000005s)]
*  out that occurred on November 9th, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=367.44000000000005s)]
*  one person was yelling death to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=369.72s)]
*  Jews, and this is how he responded. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=371.56s)]
*  He said, I was shocked, and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=373.88s)]
*  I walked directly to the person and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=375.4s)]
*  I told him, you don't represent us [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  because this is not something that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  we agree with. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=380.76s)]
*  And I took the megaphone and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  I gave a speech and I said, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=383.2s)]
*  we here are conscious, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=384.88s)]
*  educated students and we know how [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=386.23999999999995s)]
*  to separate right from wrong. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=388.28s)]
*  What this guy has said is clearly [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=390.52s)]
*  anti-Semitic against Jews. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=392.76s)]
*  To be anti-Semitic is unjust, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=394.52s)]
*  is unjust. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=396.52s)]
*  And the fight for the freedom of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  Palestine and the fight against [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=399.55999999999995s)]
*  anti-Semitism go hand in hand. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=401.4s)]
*  Because injustice anywhere is [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=403.64s)]
*  a threat to justice everywhere. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  That's what he said on 60 minutes. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=407.76s)]
*  Madhawi helped lead the pro [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=409.84s)]
*  Palestine movement at Columbia [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  until last spring, which is when [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=413.84s)]
*  the gears started to shift and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=415.94s)]
*  things started to focus more on [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=417.68s)]
*  building bridges with Jewish and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=419.56s)]
*  Israeli communities at [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  the university. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=423.18s)]
*  However, he was still a target for [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  multiple Zionist groups like [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=426.52s)]
*  the Canary Mission and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=428.18s)]
*  Betar, which later worked with [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=429.5s)]
*  the Trump administration to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=431.32s)]
*  deport the students they wanted to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=433.04s)]
*  deport. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=435.16s)]
*  So here's more, even before his [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=435.72s)]
*  friend and fellow Columbia [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=437.6s)]
*  activist Mahmoud Khalil was [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=439.12s)]
*  arrested by immigration authorities, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  Madhawi asked university [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  administrators to help him find [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=444.44s)]
*  a safe place to live so that he [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  would not be taken by ICE agents, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=448.04s)]
*  according to emails reviewed by [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=450.12s)]
*  the intercept. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=452.16s)]
*  The school did nothing in response, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=453.32000000000005s)]
*  Madhawi said. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=455.6s)]
*  When Khalil was abducted by ICE [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=456.88s)]
*  last month, Madhawi sheltered in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=458.88s)]
*  place for three weeks. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=461.20000000000005s)]
*  Only coming out when he was [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=462.72s)]
*  scheduled for his citizenship test. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=464.18s)]
*  And remember when we said earlier [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  that ICE would use this to their [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=468.16s)]
*  advantage, so here's that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=469.76000000000005s)]
*  Earlier this month, Madhawi [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=472.12s)]

*  says, yeah, we got the best [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=1015.88s)]
*  democracy in the Middle East. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=1017.52s)]
*  I mean, we have 5.5 million people [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12F2PLr2yq8&t=1019.52s)]
