TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# This Fight Just Got Even MESSIER
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ)
*  Tucker put out a statement that I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  think is factually incoherent about [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=2.1s)]
*  Mark Levin's position on Iran and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=4.4s)]
*  Iran itself. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=6.54s)]
*  The basic argument seems to be [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=7.48s)]
*  that unless you personally plan to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=9.08s)]
*  fight in a war, then you can never [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=10.84s)]
*  be in favor of American military [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=12.6s)]
*  threat or intervention on any [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=14.24s)]
*  level, which is a weird position [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  to take because I assume he doesn't [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=17.48s)]
*  take that position about the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=19.26s)]
*  police that unless you're a member [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=20.78s)]
*  of the police force, you have to be [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  in favor of the police never [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=24.46s)]
*  policing crime. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=25.92s)]
*  All right, well, Tucker Carlson and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=26.88s)]
*  Mark Levin are still trading blows [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=29.0s)]
*  over the issue of the Iran nuclear [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  deal, and now Ben Shapiro has [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  weighed in on the fight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=35.08s)]
*  So Carlson and Levin have been [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  fighting for weeks now over what [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=38.88s)]
*  the Trump administration should do [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=40.84s)]
*  about Iran. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=43.08s)]
*  On Wednesday, Carlson wrote [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=44.2s)]
*  a lengthy ex post about Levin. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=45.8s)]
*  Here are a few excerpts. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=47.8s)]
*  So Mark Levin was at the White [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=49.6s)]
*  House today lobbying for [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=51.18s)]
*  war with Iran. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=52.72s)]
*  To be clear, Levin has no plans to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  fight in this or any other war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=55.96s)]
*  He's demanding that American troops [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  do it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=60.72s)]
*  We need to stop Iran from building [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=61.22s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=63.18s)]
*  He and like minded ideologues in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=64.2s)]
*  Washington are now arguing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=66.2s)]
*  They're just weeks away. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=68.32s)]
*  If this sounds familiar, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=69.84s)]
*  it's because the same people have [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=71.08s)]
*  been making the same claims since [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=72.72s)]
*  at least the 1990s, it is a lie. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=74.4s)]
*  So we had stopped Iran from [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=76.56s)]
*  building nuclear weapons during [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=77.88s)]
*  the Obama administration, but [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=79.6s)]
*  then Trump pulled out of that deal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=81.36s)]
*  once he got into office without [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=83.16s)]
*  having any alternative deal to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=84.8s)]
*  But back to Tucker in his tweets. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=87.0s)]
*  So why is Mark Levin once again [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=89.68s)]
*  hyperventilating about weapons of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=91.2s)]
*  mass destruction? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=93.0s)]
*  To distract you from the real goal, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=94.08s)]
*  which is regime change, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  young Americans heading back to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=97.32s)]
*  the Middle East to topple yet [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=98.94s)]
*  another government. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=100.32s)]
*  Iran has extensive military ties [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=101.6s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=103.76s)]
*  It sells the overwhelming majority [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=104.76s)]
*  of its oil exports to Russia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=107.0s)]
*  Iran isn't alone. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=109.0s)]
*  An attack on Iran can very easily [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=110.56s)]
*  become a world war and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=112.36s)]
*  we would lose. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=113.6s)]
*  These are scary people, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=114.8s)]
*  I pray that Donald Trump ignores [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=116.0s)]
*  them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=117.8s)]
*  All right, so pray for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=118.52s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=119.68s)]
*  Mark Levin responded here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=120.44s)]
*  He says, he burps again. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=122.2s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=123.84s)]
*  Carlson has become a loathsome ass [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=124.76s)]
*  who is increasingly unhinged and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  pathetic. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=129.04s)]
*  Our nation's enemies love him as do [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=129.72s)]
*  certain vile and weird conspiracy [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=131.72s)]
*  theorists he promotes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=133.88s)]
*  Got him there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=135.32s)]
*  He also addressed Carlson on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=136.48s)]
*  yesterday's edition of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=138.0s)]
*  the Mark Levin show. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=139.28s)]
*  So here's some of what he had to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=140.52s)]
*  say. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=141.88s)]
*  Donald Trump and I are friends. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  Good friends. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=145.42s)]
*  I try not to bother him. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=149.66s)]
*  I don't ask to come to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=151.18s)]
*  the White House. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=152.18s)]
*  I don't ask to go to Mar-a-Largo. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=152.98s)]
*  If I'm there, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=154.78s)]
*  it's because he asked me. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=155.62s)]
*  And he asked me, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  I didn't meet the president, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=159.06s)]
*  the lobby for war with Iran. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=160.82s)]
*  But I know who was in there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=162.62s)]
*  And I know who leaked this to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=166.06s)]
*  their boy Carlson. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=168.94s)]
*  And I'm not going to forget it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  Why is Tucker a special [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=173.14s)]
*  pleader for Iran? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=174.46s)]
*  Why is Tucker a special [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=175.78s)]
*  pleader for Qatar? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=177.02s)]
*  Why is Tucker a special [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=178.34s)]
*  pleader for Putin? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=179.5s)]
*  Why isn't he a special [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=180.82s)]
*  pleader for the United States? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=181.82s)]
*  Stop hiding behind our military. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=183.34s)]
*  Stop hiding behind our people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=185.54s)]
*  Forget about the establishment and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=187.98s)]
*  all the rest. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=189.62s)]
*  Who is this guy? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=190.18s)]
*  If the US government knew Iran was [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=191.34s)]
*  weeks from possessing a nuclear [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=192.9s)]
*  weapon, we'd be at war already. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=194.26s)]
*  Here's a guy lobbying against war [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=198.34s)]
*  on any circumstances. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=200.66s)]
*  And by war, he means even limited [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=201.86s)]
*  tactical hits. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=204.9s)]
*  Not a full out war buddy, but [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  he thinks a full out war is needed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  Nobody's talking about that except [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=211.5s)]
*  him. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=212.94s)]
*  All right, so we already showed you [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=215.82s)]
*  a little bit of Ben Shapiro's take [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=217.38s)]
*  on the whole thing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=218.94s)]
*  So here's a little bit more from [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=219.86s)]
*  him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=221.1s)]

*  do. Now, bear in mind, Tucker [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  Carlson is someone who doesn't have [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=360.90000000000003s)]
*  discussions about politics. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=363.46000000000004s)]
*  He has political discussions, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=365.82s)]
*  right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  So Tucker Carlson is going to sound [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=368.98s)]
*  like he's being like, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=370.5s)]
*  let's think this through. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=371.3s)]
*  Let's see how it is. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=372.14000000000004s)]
*  But I'm just asking questions. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=373.1s)]
*  I'm just an intellectual having [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=374.74s)]
*  conversations. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=376.18s)]
*  No, he's always got some kind of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=376.82s)]
*  thing he's doing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=379.18s)]
*  And in this scenario, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=381.5s)]
*  what is he feeding on? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=382.82s)]
*  because he's a guy who after he had [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  one ill-fated experience with John [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=386.94s)]

*  lost a series of jobs and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=391.62s)]
*  disappeared. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=393.54s)]
*  And that was the scariest thing for [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=395.14s)]
*  him because he is a creature that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=396.86s)]
*  if a camera is not pointed at him, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=398.5s)]
*  he ceases to exist, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=400.3s)]
*  falls into a black hole. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=401.58s)]
*  And only if a camera finds him in [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=403.38s)]
*  there does he have life again. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  So he never wants to relinquish [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=406.9s)]
*  relevancy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=408.78s)]
*  He never wants to relinquish [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=410.14s)]
*  spotlight. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=411.53999999999996s)]
*  This comes at the expense of any [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=412.21999999999997s)]
*  semblance that he would be guided [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=414.21999999999997s)]
*  by actual principles. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=416.21999999999997s)]
*  Instead, he's still smart. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=417.97999999999996s)]
*  So he puts together what seem like [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=419.38s)]
*  his principles that are defensible [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=421.02s)]
*  but only in so far as they are [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=423.05999999999995s)]
*  strategically beneficial for [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=424.78s)]
*  him in the discourse, right? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=426.78s)]
*  So in this scenario, he just finds [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=429.46s)]
*  that there's a lot of people out [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=431.14s)]
*  there that are against war. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=432.7s)]
*  And that's simple and that's quick. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=434.94s)]
*  And if I just keep it that simple [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=437.9s)]
*  and quick all the time, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=440.14s)]
*  and I just do that, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=441.78s)]
*  that's a big audience. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  Any conversation about whether [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=445.5s)]
*  you're going to be interventionist [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=447.42s)]

*  with externalities. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=451.94s)]

*  conversation, Mark Levin's the most [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=465.34s)]
*  thinking the most kind of person, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=467.62s)]
*  but it's still an unpopular [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=469.78s)]
*  position, hasn't really gotten us [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=471.58s)]
*  anywhere, and Americans are tired [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=473.78s)]
*  of it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=475.82s)]
*  So regardless of whether it's [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=476.34s)]
*  strategically the best thing for [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=477.82s)]
*  the security of Americans, no, no, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  no, this is a political discussion. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=481.46s)]
*  This isn't a conversation about [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=483.38s)]
*  politics. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=485.17999999999995s)]
*  Tucker Carlson is just going to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=485.97999999999996s)]
*  always already be the purest person [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  in the discussion about not going [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=490.38s)]
*  to war as an American, generally, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=492.73999999999995s)]
*  that's what I'd say. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  And he's found ways to do it a lot [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=496.73999999999995s)]
*  and he's doing it here. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=498.73999999999995s)]
*  And incidentally, I think there's [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=500.38s)]
*  a lot of people who watch this show [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=502.14s)]
*  are like, I too don't like war. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=503.85999999999996s)]
*  Yes, you alluded to it a second [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=505.53999999999996s)]
*  ago. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=507.09999999999997s)]
*  This conveniently allows Tucker [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=507.62s)]
*  Carlson to just be like, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=509.38s)]
*  you want to come to me? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=510.65999999999997s)]
*  No skin off my ass if you decide to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=511.85999999999996s)]
*  take the bait here, but by and [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=513.74s)]
*  large, why can't I use it as [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=515.5s)]
*  a wedge issue with Republicans? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=517.18s)]
*  Which I think that people on [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=520.06s)]
*  the left should absolutely do to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=521.38s)]
*  try to break up their block. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=522.9s)]
*  And if we get more people over here [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=524.9s)]
*  being like, yo, there's a lot of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=526.9s)]
*  ways we can be cool, awesome folks [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=528.9s)]
*  and not go to war. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=531.06s)]
*  There's a whole like manosphere of [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=532.3s)]
*  blog of podcasts about exactly that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=534.9s)]
*  sentiment. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=537.54s)]
*  So and those guys have said they [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=539.5799999999999s)]
*  like Bernie Sanders. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=541.0799999999999s)]
*  Somewhere in there is a way to kind [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=542.02s)]
*  of shake loose some of these guys [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=543.78s)]
*  have gotten sucked up into Trump's [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=545.3399999999999s)]
*  orbit because of all the infighting [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=547.0999999999999s)]
*  and very clear wedge issue which [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=549.0600000000001s)]
*  is the Iran nuclear deal. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=550.58s)]
*  Sorry for talking so long. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=552.0600000000001s)]
*  No, yeah, I'm so offended. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=553.94s)]
*  Okay, so look, I said that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=556.78s)]
*  Republicans would fight amongst [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=559.66s)]
*  themselves and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=562.5s)]
*  they would challenge Trump. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=563.7s)]
*  I think that they have [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=565.14s)]
*  spectacularly. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=566.54s)]
*  Obviously, LaMoss just did on [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=568.1s)]
*  the budget and many others are. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=569.58s)]
*  They did on the Qatar chat. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  They certainly did on the Epstein [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=572.78s)]
*  files and also on his ridiculous [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=574.82s)]
*  idea to clear out Gaza with using [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=576.98s)]
*  American troops. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=579.34s)]
*  So Magus pushed back on a lot of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=581.0600000000001s)]
*  that stuff. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=582.6600000000001s)]
*  But this is not one of those. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=583.62s)]
*  This is a situation where Trump has [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=585.4200000000001s)]
*  not made up his mind yet. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=587.3800000000001s)]
*  And so that's why Tucker's pushing [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=589.1800000000001s)]
*  so hard Mark Levin and Ben Shapiro [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=591.1800000000001s)]
*  are pushing so hard. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=592.98s)]
*  By the way, I've got to know, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=594.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I did not see that coming [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=596.22s)]
*  Ben Shapiro coming in on [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=598.1800000000001s)]
*  the side of Israel. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=599.7800000000001s)]
*  Wow, that's got to be a first. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=601.62s)]
*  Shocker to me. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=603.7s)]
*  Of course, Ben Shapiro comes in, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=604.8199999999999s)]
*  well, Israel has told us to attack [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=606.6999999999999s)]
*  Iran, so obviously we should [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=608.74s)]
*  attack Iran. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=610.4599999999999s)]
*  Of course you think that, brother. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=611.18s)]
*  Everybody saw that coming. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=612.9s)]
*  Now he uses thing about pretending [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=615.06s)]
*  that Trump's on his side. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=616.54s)]
*  No, Trump told Israel already that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=617.54s)]
*  we are not going to attack Iran and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=619.62s)]
*  then Israel said no, but I'm going [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=621.6999999999999s)]
*  to send in Mark Levin to the White [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=623.78s)]
*  House and send in everything I got [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=625.9s)]
*  to convince you to do it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=628.06s)]
*  And then he went back to saying, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=629.5s)]
*  well, maybe that we should get rid [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=631.78s)]
*  of the whole enrichment program in [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=634.1s)]
*  Iran, so he's very much up in [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=636.38s)]
*  the air here. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=638.38s)]
*  And did Mark Levin go to the White [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=639.34s)]
*  House to talk to him about that? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=640.94s)]
*  Obviously, first of all, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=642.46s)]
*  Mark Levin never cares about any [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=644.02s)]
*  other issue but Israel. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=645.9s)]
*  I'm not sure I've heard him talk [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=647.5s)]
*  about anything else. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=649.26s)]
*  So like he's 99% of his [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=650.62s)]
*  significantly large head. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=652.86s)]
*  I don't know about what's in it, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=655.82s)]
*  but the outside is about Israel. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=657.78s)]
*  And so and you can tell too, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=659.98s)]
*  because he said in that little [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=661.5s)]
*  video, I know who leaked it and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=663.3s)]
*  I'm going to be consequences. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=665.14s)]
*  Well, okay, wait, then so [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=667.34s)]
*  if they did leak it and [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=668.9s)]
*  they leaked it accurately, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=670.1s)]
*  then apparently you were asking him [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=671.66s)]
*  to attack Iran. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=673.58s)]
*  So Tucker was right. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=674.46s)]
*  And I have to say, I don't know [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=676.58s)]
*  what he kept calling Tucker, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=678.3s)]
*  he kept calling him a special [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=680.02s)]
*  pleader? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=681.74s)]
*  A pleader, I thought he was saying. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=682.34s)]
*  It was hard to hear. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=687.54s)]
*  It sounded like he was saying he [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=688.42s)]
*  was pleading for somebody. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=689.62s)]
*  A pleader, special pleader maybe? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=690.9s)]
*  Or a special Peter which sounds [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=693.54s)]
*  kind of questionable. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=695.1800000000001s)]
*  I heard that Trump was the one with [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=697.42s)]
*  a special Peter. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=698.94s)]
*  Maybe it was a shvarta Peter, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=699.7s)]
*  which is the blackface elves that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=701.26s)]
*  take you to Spain according to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=703.1800000000001s)]
*  the Amsterdam legend of Christmas. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=704.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=707.46s)]
*  All right, look, that is, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=708.3000000000001s)]
*  we've covered that before, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=709.7s)]
*  believe it or not. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=711.34s)]
*  All right, so look, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=712.86s)]
*  last thing here, whose side am I [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=714.38s)]
*  on? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=716.86s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=717.5s)]
*  Guys, policies, issues, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=719.58s)]
*  let's focus. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=721.66s)]
*  Yes, we hate everything else Mark [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=723.1s)]
*  Levin says and Ben Shapiro says and [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=725.02s)]
*  Tucker Carlson says. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=727.0600000000001s)]
*  On this, is this a tough question [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=728.5s)]
*  for people on the left, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=730.38s)]
*  for progressives, for populists? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=731.74s)]
*  No, we don't want to go to war with [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=733.66s)]
*  Iran. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=735.0600000000001s)]
*  There's absolutely no upside. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=735.7s)]
*  And Trump apparently is working on [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=737.1s)]
*  a deal where we would get rid of [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=738.94s)]
*  their nuclear program. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=740.62s)]
*  And we wouldn't have to go to war [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=742.86s)]
*  at all, it'd be a giant win-win. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=744.82s)]
*  And Israel hates it because they [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=747.14s)]
*  want to drag us into this war. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=748.9s)]
*  And so that's why Shapiro and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=750.9s)]
*  Levin are acting the way they are. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=752.34s)]
*  And then that last line, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=754.06s)]
*  by then was hilarious. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=755.38s)]
*  No, no, it wouldn't be a full war. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=756.66s)]
*  It'd be a limited tactical strike. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=758.74s)]
*  And I'm sure that after you [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=761.38s)]
*  destroyed all their nuclear [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=762.6999999999999s)]
*  facilities and energy facilities, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=764.22s)]
*  Iran wouldn't hit any of our bases [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=766.38s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=768.22s)]
*  And that wouldn't cause us to hit [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=769.66s)]
*  them again and then them to hit us [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=771.26s)]
*  again and next thing you know, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=772.98s)]
*  look at that. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=774.54s)]
*  We're in a war with a country four [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=775.14s)]
*  times the size of Iraq and [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=777.06s)]
*  had that work out for us. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=778.5799999999999s)]
*  So I'm a hell no on this war. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=780.54s)]
*  Levin and Shapiro love every war, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=782.66s)]
*  especially every war where we [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=785.26s)]
*  attack an enemy of Israel. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=787.5799999999999s)]
*  So not close. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=789.5799999999999s)]
*  I hope Tucker wins and [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=793.3399999999999s)]
*  Trump does not go to war. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=794.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you have to use words like [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=797.0999999999999s)]
*  targeted and tactical to sell it to [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=798.66s)]
*  the American people because [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=800.4599999999999s)]
*  an attack is not a war. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=801.86s)]
*  Don't worry, retaliation isn't [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=803.54s)]
*  a thing. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=805.3s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=806.06s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=807.5799999999999s)]
*  Totally not true. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=809.14s)]
*  But it does keep you updated on [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=810.22s)]
*  our live shows. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqrXCfcuZsQ&t=811.5s)]
