TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Pam Bondi: Kilmar √Åbrego Garc√≠a Is NOT Coming Back
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s)
*  He is not coming back to our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=0.0s)]
*  country. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1.78s)]
*  President Bukele said he was not [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=3.18s)]
*  sending him back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=5.04s)]
*  That's the end of the story. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=6.46s)]
*  If he wanted to send him back, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=7.8s)]
*  we would give him a plane ride back. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=9.52s)]
*  There was no situation ever where [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=11.76s)]
*  he was going to stay in this [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=13.84s)]
*  country, none, none. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=15.42s)]
*  He would have come back, had one [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=16.98s)]
*  extra step of paperwork and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=18.8s)]
*  gone back again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=20.34s)]
*  But he's from El Salvador, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  he's in El Salvador and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=22.96s)]
*  that's where the president plans on [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  keeping him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=25.66s)]
*  So this morning, Attorney General [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=26.34s)]
*  Pam Bondi doubled down on Donald [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=28.92s)]
*  Trump's insistence that Kilmar, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  Abrego Garcia, the man mistakenly [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=33.72s)]
*  deported to El Salvador in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=36.26s)]
*  violation of a judge's order, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=38.26s)]
*  will remain in a mass prison there [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=40.58s)]
*  despite having never committed a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=42.96s)]
*  crime or been convicted of a crime. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=45.2s)]
*  But Bondi and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=47.7s)]
*  the Trump administration are facing [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  a fight because the federal judge [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=50.78s)]
*  in charge of Abrego Garcia's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=52.78s)]
*  case is not backing down. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=54.6s)]
*  Yesterday, Judge Paula Zinnis [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=56.92s)]
*  scolded the administration for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=58.86s)]
*  dragging its feet and complying [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=60.88s)]
*  with a Supreme Court order that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=62.68s)]
*  directed the White House to, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=64.4s)]
*  quote unquote, facilitate Garcia's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=66.04s)]
*  return telling a lawyer for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=68.28s)]
*  the Justice Department. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=69.9s)]
*  So here's what the judge actually [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=71.4s)]
*  said, she said to date, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=73.84s)]
*  what the record shows is that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=75.54s)]
*  nothing has been done, nothing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=77.54s)]
*  Now she's ordered an intense two [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=80.98s)]
*  week inquiry into the Trump [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=82.97999999999999s)]
*  administration's refusal to seek [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=84.58s)]
*  his return. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=86.61999999999999s)]
*  So this is from the New York Times, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=87.8s)]
*  noting that every passing day was [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=89.82s)]
*  another that Abrego Garcia, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  a 29 year old father of three, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=93.44s)]
*  suffered harm in Salvadoran [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=95.38s)]
*  custody. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  The judge set up a fast schedule [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=98.72s)]
*  for officials to provide documents [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=100.56s)]
*  and sit for depositions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=102.58s)]
*  We're going to move, she said, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  there will be no tolerance for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=106.02s)]
*  gamesmanship or grandstanding. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=107.66s)]
*  There are no business hours while [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=110.32s)]
*  we do this, cancel vacations, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=112.3s)]
*  cancel other appointments. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=114.16s)]
*  I'm usually pretty good about [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=115.58s)]
*  things like that in my court, but [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=117.0s)]
*  not this time, so [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=118.66s)]
*  I expect all hands on deck. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=119.62s)]
*  So she's not suffering any fools [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=121.34s)]
*  anymore. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=123.56s)]
*  Her ruling means that senior Trump [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=124.54s)]
*  administration officials will be [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=126.52s)]
*  forced to testify about their [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=128.62s)]
*  failure to take action. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=130.44s)]
*  And it's really not so [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=132.14s)]
*  much a failure as it is just [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=133.34s)]
*  a refusal to take that action. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=134.84s)]
*  It's willful and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=136.78s)]
*  obstinate subordination. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=137.58s)]
*  But in a written order, granting [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=139.14s)]
*  expedited discoveries and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  as said, four senior officials from [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=143.12s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=145.28s)]
*  and the Department of State will [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=147.52s)]
*  have to sit for depositions by [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=149.32s)]
*  April 23rd, essentially out of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=150.96s)]
*  court interviews in which the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  officials will have to answer [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=154.4s)]
*  questions under oath from [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=156.08s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's lawyers. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's lawyers will also [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=160.36s)]
*  be allowed to ask the government [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=162.24s)]
*  for relevant documents about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=164.0s)]
*  the case. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  At this point, three courts, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=166.52s)]
*  including the Supreme Court, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=168.28s)]
*  have ruled, the Supreme Court, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=170.10000000000002s)]
*  by the way, was unanimous that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=171.94000000000003s)]
*  the White House is required to take [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=173.66000000000003s)]
*  at least some steps toward freeing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=175.5s)]
*  Abrego Garcia. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=177.34s)]
*  But despite initially actually [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=178.5s)]
*  admitting that he had been [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=180.34s)]
*  deported by mistake, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=181.86s)]
*  the Trump administration is still [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=183.18s)]
*  falsely insisting that he is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=185.34s)]
*  an MS-13 gang member that should [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  have been sent back to El Salvador. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=189.22000000000003s)]
*  And we talked about this on [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=192.34s)]
*  yesterday's show. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=193.62s)]
*  Those claims are incredibly [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  misleading and the judge recently [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=196.34s)]
*  argued that the evidence against [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  him was completely vague and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=199.74s)]
*  unreliable. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=201.12s)]
*  This morning when Pam Bondi was [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=202.68s)]
*  pressed to release whatever [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  evidence they allegedly had, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=206.52s)]
*  she would not share any details. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=208.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego Garcia in Maryland, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=212.44s)]
*  he's in a prison now in El [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=214.74s)]
*  Salvador. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  He was sent there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=217.56s)]
*  You insist the president, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=218.96s)]
*  everybody in the administration [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=220.36s)]
*  insists that he's MS-13. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=222.12s)]
*  It appears that there's not going [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=224.24s)]

*  And it is truly, I think, unwell is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=282.2s)]
*  the word I'm going to go with [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=285.44s)]
*  But what's so baffling about this [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=285.94s)]
*  story to me is the fact that at [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  first they sort of acknowledged [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  their mistake, but then they were [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=290.74s)]
*  like, you know what, we just have [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=292.46s)]
*  to double down on everything. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  Because I don't know what mistakes [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=295.3s)]
*  are weakness or if they admit to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=297.09999999999997s)]
*  have made a mistake, then it's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=298.86s)]
*  like, obviously this is the poorly [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  thought out and poorly executed [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=302.47999999999996s)]

*  What do you think? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, they fired the guy who came [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=307.46s)]
*  out and said, we made a mistake by [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=309.94s)]
*  deporting this person. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=312.58s)]
*  I think the only look, I don't [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=314.62s)]
*  know anybody in the Trump [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=316.56s)]
*  administration, I just go off of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=318.0s)]
*  what's actually out there in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  the public record. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  And it feels like what they're [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=323.36s)]
*  doing is an attempt to have the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=326.44s)]
*  most muscular sort of outwardly [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=329.0s)]
*  powerful response to what I would [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=332.04s)]
*  say is literally the only mandate [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=335.04s)]
*  that the Trump administration has [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=338.12s)]
*  is that mass deportation or [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=341.12s)]
*  getting rid of a lot of the people [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  that came to the country under [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=346.34s)]
*  the Biden administration is broadly [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=348.62s)]
*  popular. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=351.7s)]
*  There's like a 55 to 60% approval [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=352.7s)]
*  for it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  It's literally the only thing, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=356.7s)]
*  the only leg they have to stand on. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=359.06s)]
*  And they think because of that, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=361.9s)]
*  they need to show basically a show [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=364.3s)]
*  of force that we will recklessly [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=366.82s)]
*  throw you in a freaking gulag in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=369.21999999999997s)]
*  South America. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=371.68s)]
*  The problem that they have is that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=372.88000000000005s)]
*  they have no credibility here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=375.48s)]
*  One, we know that net deportations [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  are flat, meaning Joe Biden was [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=381.16s)]
*  deporting the same amount of people [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  as the Trump administration at [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=386.76000000000005s)]
*  similar rates. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=389.36s)]
*  And two, they don't have the goods. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=390.88s)]
*  All of these gang members, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=394.12s)]
*  all of these violent criminals, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  all of these people who are [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=398.32000000000005s)]
*  violent criminals, all of these [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=399.94s)]
*  illegal aliens who are poisoning [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=402.02000000000004s)]
*  America's streets and making our [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=404.1s)]
*  children's unsafe and threatening [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=406.26s)]
*  to kill our babies in their cribs. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=408.42s)]
*  They don't have a shred of evidence. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=410.58000000000004s)]
*  The one guy they said was an MS-13 [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=413.5s)]
*  ringleader in Virginia. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  They said he was like a kingpin and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=417.94s)]
*  coordinated this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=419.86s)]
*  All they got him on was a gun [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=421.3s)]
*  charge. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=422.5s)]
*  They got the governor of Virginia [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=422.82s)]
*  to show up to this guy's trial. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=425.1s)]
*  Basically, he was a show pony, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=427.70000000000005s)]
*  look, we got a ringleader, nothing. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=429.44s)]
*  They don't have a wiretap. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=432.24s)]
*  They don't have pictures. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=434.04s)]
*  They don't have snitches. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=435.36s)]
*  Fellow MS-13 guys that are like, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=436.8s)]
*  no, no, this was my boss. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  They have nothing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=439.72s)]
*  And so all they can fall back on is [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=441.64000000000004s)]
*  this double down because they've [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=443.32s)]
*  been caught with their pants down. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=445.0s)]
*  There's just no substance here. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=446.8s)]
*  And the crazy thing for [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=449.12s)]
*  them is that the one thing that is [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=450.6s)]
*  broadly popular about their entire [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=452.72s)]
*  harebrained agenda, they are losing [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  credibility on it by the day. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=457.9s)]
*  They're sending barbers. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=461.98s)]
*  They're sending makeup artists. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=464.02s)]
*  Instead of like, all right, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=465.86s)]
*  go to the jails where these guys [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=467.09999999999997s)]
*  are in county lockup or these guys [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=468.7s)]
*  are on Rikers Island or [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=470.42s)]
*  something like that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=471.58s)]
*  And they're awaiting trial and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=472.82s)]
*  it's for violent crimes. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=474.02s)]
*  Scoop those guys up. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=475.34s)]
*  I bet you the country would be [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=476.58s)]
*  broadly behind even this crazy [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=478.02s)]
*  non-due process thing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=479.62s)]
*  But they're not, they literally [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  can't come up with these people. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=483.02s)]
*  Yeah, and I thought it was funny [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=484.38s)]
*  also and I mentioned this on [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=486.18s)]
*  yesterday's show. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=487.62s)]
*  But they did have one instance [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=488.52s)]
*  recently of terrorism that was [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=490.28s)]
*  actually reported as being [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  terrorism in the news. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=493.76s)]
*  But that was that MAGA guy who set [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=495.15999999999997s)]
*  Governor Shapiro's house on fire in [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=497.4s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=499.96s)]
*  He was charged with terrorism. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=501.0s)]
*  So, I mean, they really just have [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=502.92s)]
*  to build this whole narrative [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=504.9s)]
*  around terrorism and gang violence. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=506.56s)]
*  Because they know that if people [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  are afraid enough, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=510.44s)]
*  then they will support things and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=511.64s)]
*  they will including things like [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=513.5799999999999s)]
*  the suspension of due process. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=515.4599999999999s)]
*  But actually speaking of due [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=517.2199999999999s)]
*  process, while some in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=519.18s)]
*  the administration are now just [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=520.5799999999999s)]

*  of myself. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=632.82s)]

*  harder for the Trump administration [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=648.38s)]
*  to blame that on the Biden [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=650.38s)]

*  a press conference that he held [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  today in El Salvador. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=773.84s)]
*  I asked the vice president if [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=775.96s)]
*  Abrego Garcia has not committed [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=778.88s)]
*  a crime and the US courts have [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=782.24s)]
*  found that he was illegally taken [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=785.12s)]
*  for the United States. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=787.96s)]
*  And the government of El Salvador [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=789.84s)]
*  has no evidence that he was part of [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=792.7600000000001s)]
*  MS-13. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=795.6s)]
*  Why is El Salvador continuing to [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=797.0400000000001s)]
*  hold him in Seacott? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  And his answer was that the Trump [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=801.5600000000001s)]
*  administration is paying El [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=804.7s)]
*  Salvador, the government of [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=807.76s)]
*  El Salvador, to keep him at Seacott. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=810.96s)]
*  All right, so in addition to that, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=814.66s)]
*  this is reporting from the Hill, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=817.22s)]
*  it says Van Hollen said embassy [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=819.5s)]
*  staff members informed him that [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=821.38s)]
*  they have received no directive [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=823.26s)]
*  from the Trump administration to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=825.14s)]
*  make outreach on Abrego Garcia's [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=826.98s)]
*  behalf despite a Supreme Court [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=828.86s)]
*  order to make a statement to [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=830.64s)]
*  the president of the United States [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=832.26s)]
*  in order to facilitate his return. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=834.4s)]
*  So that was a crazy response that [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=837.28s)]
*  we heard not just from the vice [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=839.28s)]
*  president, but also from Senator [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=841.16s)]
*  Chuck Grassley. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=843.3s)]
*  Also, I think this is also coming [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=844.72s)]
*  up later on in the show, but [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=846.56s)]
*  Jesse Waters on Fox News said that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=848.0s)]
*  this guy was obviously MS-13 because [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=849.92s)]
*  he was obviously wearing a Chicago [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=852.12s)]
*  Bulls hat or jersey, whichever one [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=854.4s)]
*  it was, as if all of us weren't [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=856.6s)]
*  walking around wearing Chicago [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=858.44s)]
*  Bulls merch back in the 90s, right? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=860.44s)]
*  So ultimately, this is making [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=862.66s)]
*  Republicans look really bad. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=864.38s)]
*  We're seeing that backlash at these [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=866.18s)]
*  Republican town halls. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=868.18s)]
*  That was a Chuck Grassley town [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=869.66s)]
*  hall, so you know that that's [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=871.1s)]
*  a very, very red district. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=872.64s)]
*  So do you think Republicans at [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=874.58s)]
*  large are going to face any kind of [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=876.06s)]
*  backlash from their base over [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=877.64s)]
*  the Trump administration's [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=879.1s)]
*  decision not to abide by court [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=880.6s)]
*  orders because it really seems [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=882.14s)]
*  like it's bothering a lot of their [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=883.84s)]
*  constituents? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=885.54s)]
*  I think the minute that people [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=888.3s)]
*  realize that the immigration [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=890.18s)]
*  stuff is business as usual, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=892.16s)]
*  there's going to be a backlash. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's particularly [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=896.48s)]
*  going to be because some guys got [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=898.56s)]
*  deported that shouldn't have. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=900.56s)]
*  I don't know that the Republican [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=902.52s)]
*  base really cares all of that much [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=904.4399999999999s)]
*  about due process for people they [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=906.36s)]
*  deem to be quote unquote illegal [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=908.28s)]
*  aliens. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=910.1999999999999s)]
*  But I think when they do get [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=911.16s)]
*  around to noticing that there are [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=912.62s)]
*  no immigrants actually leaving [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=914.3199999999999s)]
*  the country, and I think JB kind of [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=916.12s)]
*  gives the game away. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=918.12s)]
*  Like he, in his parlance, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=919.56s)]
*  in his statement, when he says, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=921.6600000000001s)]
*  we don't have the resources, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=923.9000000000001s)]
*  we can't, bro, you guys have [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=926.1s)]
*  majorities in the Senate and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=928.1s)]
*  the freaking Congress, okay? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=930.26s)]
*  Why don't you pass a bill [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=932.7800000000001s)]
*  appropriating more monies, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=934.58s)]
*  more resources to ICE so that you [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=936.7800000000001s)]
*  guys can do your mass deportation, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=939.0600000000001s)]
*  put more money behind it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=941.7s)]
*  You guys are, these guys are [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=943.58s)]
*  allocating a trillion dollar budget [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=945.7800000000001s)]
*  for the Pentagon and [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=948.58s)]
*  the military industrial complex. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=950.04s)]

*  Medicare, they're doing all kinds [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=956.56s)]
*  of stuff financially, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=959.16s)]

*  these allegedly horrible illegal [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=966.24s)]

*  I promise you, if these guys [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=999.86s)]
*  rounded these folks up and [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1002.02s)]
*  just sent them back to El Salvador, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1003.86s)]
*  Venezuela, people would be like, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1006.26s)]
*  what are they voting for? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1008.48s)]
*  Instead, they're doing this fake [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1010.24s)]
*  show of force. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1012.36s)]
*  They're trying to look like tough [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1013.84s)]
*  guys, so they're sending them to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1015.44s)]
*  these freaking prisons where people [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  are getting dying all the time, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  being beaten to death. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1020.4000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes they go starving. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1022.0s)]
*  They're sending these people to [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1023.9200000000001s)]
*  concentration camps, essentially. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1025.4s)]
*  Instead of just doing the thing [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1027.82s)]
*  they were elected to do, which is [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1029.16s)]
*  like, look, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1030.56s)]
*  people do want to see deportations, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1031.24s)]
*  but they're not doing that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1033.16s)]
*  So again, they have to do the show [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1035.04s)]
*  of force, and they're doing all [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1037.22s)]
*  this funny stuff in order to seem [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1038.9s)]
*  tough when realistically, again, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1040.64s)]
*  go look at the deportation numbers. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1042.7s)]
*  They're flat. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1044.7s)]
*  Biden deported as much people as [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1045.74s)]
*  Trump did, which is insane when you [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1047.38s)]
*  really sit and think about this. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1049.14s)]
*  I mean, so much of this is insane. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1050.8600000000001s)]
*  There's so many different aspects [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1052.94s)]
*  of this story that it feels like [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1054.7s)]
*  you're being gaslit and just [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1056.3s)]
*  spoken to like you're an idiot [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1057.7s)]
*  this whole time. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1059.26s)]
*  And that's what our government's [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1060.42s)]
*  doing. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1061.98s)]
*  This is coming from our elected [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1062.5s)]
*  leaders, which is, yeah, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1064.1000000000001s)]
*  it's just mind-blowing. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1065.46s)]
*  In this space, and I know for us, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1066.92s)]

*  There's so [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1075.8400000000001s)]
*  much going on right now to consider. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1076.44s)]
*  And yeah, you're absolutely right. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1078.4s)]
*  This feels like a very fake show [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1079.8000000000002s)]

*  They cannot look weak. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1082.0800000000002s)]
*  They can't back down from anything, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1083.3600000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1085.0s)]
*  To the point where they can't, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1085.5600000000002s)]
*  instead of just admitting that one [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1087.0800000000002s)]
*  person that they deported should [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1088.8000000000002s)]
*  not have been deported, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1090.4s)]

*  things slip through the cracks. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1095.58s)]
*  Even if you have such a tight [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1097.5s)]

*  double down to the point now that [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1110.78s)]
*  they're calling things like [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxakun9sy6s&t=1112.6599999999999s)]
