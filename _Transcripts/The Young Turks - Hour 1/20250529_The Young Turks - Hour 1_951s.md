"Elon Musk took a swipe at President Trump‚Äôs signature domestic policy legislation, saying it would add to the national deficit. He complained to administration officials about a lucrative deal that went to a rival company to build an artificial-intelligence data center in the Middle East. And he has yet to make good on a $100 million pledge to Trump‚Äôs political operation."

# Elon Musk Can't Stop Pouting
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k)
*  Elon Musk has officially ended his time in the federal government. Now he was a special [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=0.0s)]
*  federal government employee, and there are limitations to the amount of time they can [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=5.28s)]
*  serve in that role. So it's not like he slammed the door on Trump's face and said, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=10.24s)]
*  I'm out of here. No, his time was up. However, he seems pretty bitter about his run [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  in the Trump administration. So Musk officially announced his departure last night writing, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=20.8s)]
*  as my scheduled time as a special government employee comes to an end, I would like to thank [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=26.96s)]
*  President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The Doge mission [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=31.76s)]
*  will only strengthen over time, will it, as it becomes a way of life throughout the government? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=36.64s)]
*  Is it? Now was just yesterday, literally just yesterday we covered a story where Elon Musk was [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=44.32s)]
*  furious about the big beautiful bill, right? Because of the fact that it adds $3 trillion [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=52.08s)]
*  to our national debt. So I don't know how he reconciles the statement of the Doge mission [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=57.04s)]
*  will only strengthen over time with the fact that, no, it's business as usual in the federal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=65.52s)]
*  government and we're adding to the deficit and the debt. What do you think? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what this guy was expecting. I think everybody could get behind the idea that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=75.91999999999999s)]
*  the government could be more efficient, which is fair. I think that's fair game. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=83.52s)]
*  Probably every American citizen agrees with that premise. But when you're talking about we want to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=88.8s)]
*  cut two trillion, and he's like, yeah, maybe we'll just do one trillion. And you can't touch the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=94.56s)]
*  Pentagon. Politically, touching Medicare would be a disaster. So would touching social. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=100.96s)]
*  The only thing they could come up with was Medicaid by fraudulently pretending that they [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=109.91999999999999s)]
*  were kicking off freeloaders or something stupid like that. There's no savings to be had, bro. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  And especially not in the haphazard way that Elon was trying to do it, which is just fire everybody [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  and put the agencies back together piecemeal. While in the meantime, we lose air traffic [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=127.28s)]
*  controllers and social security office people and just the most asinine thing you could ever do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=133.6s)]
*  So I have a family member who got one of those layoff notices. She worked in the IRS. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=141.6s)]
*  And in the beginning, she kind of joined her colleagues in trying to fight for their jobs. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=149.52s)]
*  And by the way, she's very smart, brilliant person. And then along the way, she's like, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  what am I doing? Why am I fighting so hard to fight for a federal government that doesn't want [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  me, doesn't appreciate me? I'm gonna go into private practice as a CPA and make bank. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=170.08s)]
*  And that's just one example. It's an anecdote. But think about all the different people who have been [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=176.56s)]
*  laid off from their federal government jobs in all these different agencies who are skilled workers. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=183.52s)]
*  They're not just randos off the street. And so they're gone. A lot of these people are gone. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  They're working in the private sector. And these gutted government agencies that need skilled [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=196.08s)]
*  workers to carry out these jobs. It's just gonna be really hard to fill those jobs because, again, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  you can't just pick any rando off the street and fill those jobs with these individuals. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=208.72s)]
*  So with that in mind, you have this post on X from Musk. It's very formal, nothing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=212.8s)]
*  shady toward the Trump administration, no salt. However, the tone of that post is very different [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=220.56s)]
*  from the tone that you'll notice from Elon Musk in other statements he's been saying [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=226.8s)]
*  recently, especially over the past several days. So he estimated that 60 to 70% of his time in the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=231.68s)]
*  federal government was fun. He had a great time slashing and burning things as the richest man [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=238.88s)]
*  in the world. But he's also been venting a lot about his experience there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=243.76s)]
*  So a few days ago, he responded, did my best to an X post that read, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=248.4s)]
*  Doge is literally one of the most popular government initiatives in history, is it? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=254.56s)]
*  I don't know where these numbers are from. Okay, I've seen polling that's very opposite of what I'm [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=259.6s)]
*  about to read. 73% of Americans say they support cutting government waste. I can believe that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=264.56s)]
*  because the devil's in the details, what government waste are we talking about, right? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=271.52s)]
*  Trump brought in the smartest man on Earth to do it. The left destroyed Elon for it. The GOP won't [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=276.08s)]
*  vote on it. I can't believe this. And in response to that, Elon Musk said, I did my best. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=283.44s)]
*  Now, in an interview with the Washington Post, Elon Musk also complained about how [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=289.44s)]
*  Washington DC treated Doge, saying the federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=293.52s)]
*  I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  to say the least. Okay, I'm gonna reiterate, you are the richest man on the planet [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=306.24s)]
*  who was hyper focused on shutting down social security field offices. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=314.88s)]
*  He referred to social security, one of the most popular universal programs in America as a Ponzi [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=320.24s)]
*  scheme. He dismantled the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which its name, by the way, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=326.0s)]
*  suggests that it does good things for consumers. Defrauded consumers end up getting their money [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=333.68s)]
*  back from financial institutions that have defrauded them. But his priorities communicated [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=340.56s)]
*  something to the American people and they didn't like that communication, especially from the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=347.04s)]
*  richest man in the country, the world. He also says Doge is just becoming the whipping boy [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  for everything. Something bad would happen anywhere and we would get blamed for it, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=356.72s)]
*  even if we had nothing to do with it. Now, he also shut again, shut down social [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=362.48s)]
*  security field offices, two of which were in one state, Georgia. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=366.72s)]
*  He dismantled the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He fired a bunch of federal workers, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=371.12s)]
*  many of whom were veterans. That wasn't a popular thing to do. And look, the data backs up that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=375.84s)]
*  people were annoyed by him and what he was focusing on cutting. He was not cutting waste [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=384.64s)]
*  in the Pentagon, which we know there's a lot of waste in the Pentagon because they can't pass a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=390.96s)]
*  single audit. So let's take a look at what the data actually says about how Americans feel in [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=395.2s)]
*  regard to Doge. How low can you go? Oh my, okay, take a look here. Elon Musk's net favorability [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=400.64s)]
*  rating. Look at this shift back in 2017 before he really started this politics thing. He was at plus [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=407.68s)]
*  24 points. Look at where he is now. Whoa, he fell through the floor, minus 19 points. Among Democrats, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=412.4s)]
*  the fall is even more dramatic. We're talking about going from plus 35 points on that favorability [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=420.08s)]
*  rating. That is quite a popular guy among Democrats to get this now down to minus 91 points. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=425.04s)]
*  Trump love talking about Elon Musk at the beginning of his administration. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=431.92s)]
*  Trump posts about Musk on Truth Social. Look at this from January 20th to April 4th. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  He posted about 40 times. Look from April 5th onward, 000. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=440.72s)]
*  Wow, American people not happy with Elon Musk and he's not happy. They're unhappy with him. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=446.64s)]
*  It's interesting because Trump will use people to his benefit and then once they're a political [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=456.64s)]
*  liability, he'll drop them real quick. I mean, he's a politician. That's what politicians do. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=464.64s)]
*  I guess I shouldn't be surprised. But I'm sure that annoys Elon Musk to some extent as well, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=468.88s)]
*  even though he hasn't complained about that publicly yet. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=473.2s)]
*  Was what do you make of the American sentiment toward Musk? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=476.08s)]
*  It's not hard to understand in polarized times. This guy decided to make himself [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=480.24s)]
*  into a partisan figure, just in completely idiotic move. And in the manner that he did so, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  it's not as if he was some like, he made himself try to look like some [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=496.64s)]
*  bureaucrat, right? Like Besant or one of these other guys in the Trump cabinet. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=501.2s)]
*  Instead, he's at conservative conferences with chainsaws and like, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  we want federal workers to feel pain. And he literally tried to make himself into a villain. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=512.8s)]
*  And so people viewed him that way. He did everything that he could to get attention [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=520.96s)]
*  for the stuff that he was doing. And it was broadly unpopular. And the fact that Trump [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=527.52s)]
*  has distanced himself, I'm not surprised. Because Elon is not at all politically useful, but also [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=533.6s)]
*  Trump staffers and cabinet members, like, AKA the people who work in the government bureaucracy [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=540.8s)]
*  on the behalf of Donald Trump, don't like the idea that Elon tried to come in and tell them [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=548.56s)]
*  what to do with their staff and their budgeting. And this was always a conflict. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=555.12s)]
*  And I think we talked about this up here, all of this predictable stuff where it's like, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=562.72s)]
*  we're gonna make the government super efficient. Trump already promised a huge tax cut. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=567.52s)]
*  That's not efficiency, that's government spending, guys. That's revenue that's not going [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=572.4s)]
*  into the government coffers to pay down our debt. So that the richest people in the country [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=579.28s)]
*  could get a little bit richer. And I think Elon, I think these people are deficit hawks and stuff [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=585.2s)]
*  like that, because they really enjoyed the atmosphere where there was zero interest on [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=592.96s)]
*  loans. And so that zero interest sort of environment, it might be gone forever. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  And a lot of these guys are like, damn, maybe we shouldn't be doing all this crazy [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=609.04s)]
*  tax cutting and all of that. Maybe what was most important was keeping our interest low. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=617.52s)]
*  Well, what's interesting is there are some stories coming out now about how [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=621.36s)]
*  over leveraged equity firms are really struggling right now. Because they took out all these loans, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=626.64s)]
*  low interest loans, they're thinking- No interest loans. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  No interest loans. Now they're struggling a bit, okay? So I hope they all go under, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=637.36s)]
*  they won't, but some of them might, some of them will. And that's cause for celebration. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=643.44s)]
*  These private equity firms are some of the scummiest institutions in this country and have [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=648.72s)]
*  made a lot of money to the detriment of the American people. Certainly when it comes to [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=654.64s)]
*  the housing market, when it comes to businesses they acquired under this false pretense of wanting [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=658.16s)]
*  to save the businesses, but all they did was rape and pillage those businesses and destroyed them. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=663.76s)]
*  I mean, Toys R Us is a good example of that. Toys R Us, okay? I grew up on Toys R Us. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=670.08s)]
*  Love that store. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=676.64s)]
*  Exactly, that doesn't exist anymore and it's because of private equity. So [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=677.2s)]
*  the low interest environment led to a lot of abusive behavior by the haves, if you will. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=681.84s)]
*  And so it's distorted the economy, it's distorted the stock market. And so I think you're right. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=689.84s)]
*  I don't think we'll ever go back to an era like that. But I do think the Federal Reserve is [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=696.96s)]
*  looking to lower interest rates. It's just hard to do it when you have a president who seems [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=702.56s)]
*  willing to engage in acts that lead to a lot of economic uncertainty, like the [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=708.0s)]
*  wide ranging tariffs and all of that stuff. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=713.28s)]
*  So final thing I'll say is there's a House Republican who gave Fox News Digital [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=716.08s)]
*  an anonymous quote about Elon Musk. And I'm so sick of these cowards. How about you grow a set? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=722.96s)]
*  If you're gonna say something, say it and say it with your name being attached to it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  But this person says, this is why Musk has no place in Congress. He wants to codify discretionary [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=739.76s)]
*  cuts. He didn't find enough waste, fraud and abuse to fund the small business administration, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=745.12s)]
*  let alone reduce our debt. This was a gimmick. He got used. He's now upset. He played the game. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=751.44s)]
*  He got what he wanted. Then he ended up like everyone else who gets too close, dying to know [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=759.2s)]
*  who this House Republican is. But we never will know. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=765.28s)]
*  Did he get used? He got a few contracts for Starlink and SpaceX. He got some money out of this. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=768.96s)]
*  Don't get it twisted. And the regulatory bodies that were looking into the horrible labor [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=778.88s)]
*  practices at Tesla and some of his other companies, that stuff just got thrown by the wayside. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=787.04s)]
*  I mean, I think he came out roses now reputationally. Look, the Tesla stock, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=794.88s)]
*  the board doing exploratory meetings for a new CEO. Making yourself a partisan while being a CEO, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=802.8s)]
*  while so much of your customer base is a bunch of libs. And your cars ain't cheap, bro. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=816.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, losing all of those libs, you ain't gonna be able to replace them [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=822.72s)]
*  with a bunch of Trump people. It doesn't work like that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=827.2s)]
*  But it's not just a bunch of Trump fans that just go out and show 90 Gs on an ugly-ass Cybertruck. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=830.24s)]
*  That was a bad move on his part. I think some of that he's regretting as well. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=836.96s)]
*  I know, I mean, there was a big market of libs who love ugly EVs, right? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=843.52s)]
*  You're not gonna find that on the right. Certainly not to the same extent. They want American muscle. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=851.44s)]
*  I'm just kidding. I don't know what they want, but they are less inclined to opt for an EV. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=857.12s)]
*  I used this example earlier and Trump's hotel in Las Vegas, right? I know for a fact, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=863.12s)]
*  no libs ever gonna stay there again. But it's a hotel in Vegas, probably like 350, 400 a night. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=869.84s)]
*  Conservatives can make up the inventory there. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=877.2s)]
*  And be like, whatever, these libs don't wanna stay there, I'm gonna stay at the Trump hotel. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=880.24s)]
*  It's a whole other ballgame to do 70, 80, 90,000 purchase on a car. That's way different, man. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=884.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good point. The price point is really a good point here. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=892.64s)]
*  Look, if the price is right, I wouldn't be opposed to staying at a Trump hotel. I don't care, right? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=897.2s)]
*  I just wouldn't. It's not even that it's giving Trump money or any of that, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  cuz he probably doesn't even own it. It's the people that are gonna be there. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=910.16s)]
*  It's Vegas, though. It's Vegas. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=914.72s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=916.96s)]
*  Okay, all right, fair enough. My problem with the Trump hotel in Vegas is, is it in Vegas? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=918.72s)]
*  It's like nowhere near the strip. You gotta stay on the strip. You gotta. What are you gonna do? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=925.76s)]
*  You're gonna get a car and drive to the strip while you're in Vegas? No, I'm not gonna do that. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=930.9599999999999s)]
*  Anyway, it's not prime location. Trump property in Vegas, not prime location. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okfBuBnIB1k&t=935.76s)]
