"DUBAI, United Arab EmiratesI (AP) ‚Äî Israel launched blistering attacks on the heart of Iran‚Äôs nuclear and military structure Friday, deploying warplanes and drones previously smuggled into the country to assault key facilities and kill top generals and scientists ‚Äî a barrage it said was necessary before its adversary got any closer to building an atomic weapon.
Iran retaliated late Friday by unleashing scores of ballistic missiles on Israel, where explosions flared in the skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook the buildings below."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# DEADLY Israeli Strikes On Iran Stun World
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E)
*  Netanyahu is going to go, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=0.0s)]
*  checkmate America. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=2.0s)]
*  Now you're my bitch again. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Now you fight my wars. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And they'll probably even [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=8.36s)]
*  withdraw and say, America, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=9.3s)]
*  you do our dirty work for us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=10.42s)]
*  Spend a couple of trillion like you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=11.48s)]
*  did in Iraq and your tens of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=13.44s)]
*  thousands of Americans get killed [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=15.0s)]
*  or wounded, who cares? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=16.96s)]
*  Israel needs you to do something for [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  us, hurry up and do it, okay? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=20.6s)]
*  And American media was like, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=22.96s)]
*  they are the victims, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=24.04s)]
*  they are the victims, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=24.8s)]
*  they're doing self-defense now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  We have to help them with [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=26.52s)]
*  their defense. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  What do you mean defense? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=27.76s)]
*  What is defense? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  No, it's nothing but offense. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=30.2s)]
*  With allies like this, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=31.44s)]
*  you don't need enemies. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=32.28s)]
*  Overnight, Israel carrying out [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=33.6s)]
*  a major attack inside Iran, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  aimed at crippling its nuclear [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=37.22s)]
*  program and preventing Iran from [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=38.92s)]
*  building a nuclear bomb. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=40.76s)]
*  So, multiple waves of strikes [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=42.36s)]
*  throughout the night across [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=44.28s)]
*  multiple cities, hitting nuclear [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  enrichment facilities and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=48.24s)]
*  ballistic missile centers, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=49.9s)]
*  multiple residential buildings [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  engulfed in flames in Iran's capital. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  When enemies build weapons of mass [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=55.56s)]
*  stop them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=57.44s)]
*  This operation will continue for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=58.32s)]
*  as many days as it takes to remove [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=60.32s)]
*  this threat. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=62.28s)]
*  I'm assuming that does not count [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=63.8s)]
*  for America and Israel, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=65.48s)]
*  which also have weapons of mass [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  death. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=68.16s)]
*  But just for Iran, in any event, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=68.8s)]
*  we're all now, whether we like it [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=70.52s)]
*  or not, and I think most people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=72.16s)]
*  watching this probably won't. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=73.56s)]
*  A whole lot closer to all that war [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=75.24s)]
*  in the Middle East, thanks to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=76.96s)]
*  Israel launching its massive, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=78.64s)]
*  preemptive attack on Iran. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=80.42s)]
*  What we would call, if it were any [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=82.2s)]
*  other country, the initiation of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=83.88s)]
*  a war. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  The United States and Israel, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=86.38s)]
*  you could just do this sort of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  thing and it's just a strategy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  It's just cool, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  everybody quiet down about it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=91.94s)]
*  But it is big objectively, Iran has [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  not been hit like this since [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  the 1980s. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=97.22s)]
*  There have been more limited [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=98.53999999999999s)]
*  strikes inside of Iranian territory [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  earlier this year from Israel, but [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=103.06s)]
*  this really does stand out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=105.42s)]
*  And bear in mind, it happened right [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=107.42s)]
*  before what we're supposed to be, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  hopefully fruitful conversations [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=111.1s)]
*  between the United States and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=113.02s)]
*  Iran this weekend to try to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  establish some sort of nuclear [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=115.94s)]
*  deal between our two countries. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=117.7s)]
*  That deal being necessary because [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=119.38s)]
*  Donald Trump tore up the previous [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=121.42s)]
*  deal in his first term because he [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=123.44s)]
*  had not negotiated it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=125.4s)]
*  Thus necessitating a new one and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=127.14s)]
*  also raising fears about [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=128.92s)]
*  the possibility that they could be [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=130.18s)]
*  developing nuclear weapons. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=131.94s)]
*  Bear in mind, we didn't have [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=133.34s)]
*  inspectors on the ground because [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=134.84s)]
*  Donald Trump destroyed [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=136.74s)]
*  the previous deal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=138.06s)]
*  But this operation which they're [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=139.22s)]
*  calling Rising Lion, very cool, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=141.54s)]
*  no notes, very cool. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=144.38s)]
*  It involved heavy air strikes [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=146.9s)]
*  against some of Iran's main uranium [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=148.62s)]
*  enrichment sites, strikes inside [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=150.82s)]
*  of the capital as well as in other [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=153.18s)]
*  cities. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=155.1s)]
*  They were designed to take out [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=155.6s)]
*  the military leadership and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=157.32s)]
*  they were quite successful in doing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=159.02s)]
*  that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  In total, over 100 targets were hit, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=161.62s)]
*  more than 200 jets were used as [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=164.3s)]
*  well as drones and precision weapons [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  that had been smuggled into Iran and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=169.1s)]
*  had been stored there by the Israeli [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  spy agency, Mossad, indicating that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=174.3s)]
*  they apparently have a quite robust [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=177.02s)]
*  operation inside of Iranian [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=179.52s)]
*  territory. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  And it does appear that there's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=182.06s)]
*  been some success, although not [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=184.06s)]
*  necessarily exactly what might have [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=186.02s)]
*  been hoped from this attack. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=188.38s)]
*  The command center and centrifuges [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=190.1s)]
*  at one of Iran's main uranium and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=192.46s)]
*  enrichment sites, that's Natanz, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=194.62s)]
*  are likely to have been destroyed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=197.1s)]
*  They didn't hit the most likely [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=199.7s)]
*  repository of the closest to bomb [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=201.7s)]
*  grade nuclear fuel that Iran [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  possesses. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=205.74s)]

*  I guess aids that were killed, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=240.34s)]
*  there were also dozens of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=242.3s)]
*  civilians, of course. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=243.82s)]

*  A spokesperson for the IDF is [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=252.86s)]

*  And yeah, so look, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=259.5s)]
*  there's a lot, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=260.58000000000004s)]
*  it's a developing situation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=261.46000000000004s)]
*  Iran launched a very limited [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=263.22s)]
*  counterattack that in the immediate [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=264.86s)]
*  aftermath of it that I don't believe [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=266.98s)]
*  any of the drones they launched [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=269.06s)]
*  actually made it through to Israel. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=270.7s)]
*  They have launched missiles more [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=272.3s)]
*  recently prior to us going live. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=273.94s)]
*  Some of those appear to have struck [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=275.66s)]
*  inside of Tel Aviv. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  I believe there are reports of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=278.54s)]
*  injuries, at least as of when we [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=279.98s)]
*  were going live. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=281.58000000000004s)]
*  I had not seen any confirmations of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=282.38s)]
*  any fatalities as a result of that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=284.22s)]
*  But it's a developing situation. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=286.62s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has said that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  this is just the beginning, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=290.26s)]
*  they're going to continue. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=291.54s)]
*  And as you'll see, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=292.74s)]
*  Trump is promising more of that as [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=293.94s)]
*  well. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=296.1s)]
*  But Cenk, lot going on, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=297.42s)]
*  mystery being made. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=299.42s)]
*  Yep, so let me start on media and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=301.18s)]
*  propaganda and then I want to get [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=302.98s)]
*  to the most important part, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=304.82s)]
*  which is how Trump got suckered [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=306.42s)]
*  into this war because he's an [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=308.22s)]
*  idiot. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=309.86s)]
*  And I will explain and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=310.46s)]
*  you will agree. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=311.58s)]
*  Whether you're left or right, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  it's super obvious. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=314.22s)]
*  So first off on the media, and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=315.62s)]
*  look, we fall into this sometimes [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=317.82s)]
*  as well. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  So they attacked their nuclear [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=321.06s)]
*  program. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=323.42s)]
*  They also attacked in the middle of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=324.98s)]
*  Tehran, their capital city. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=326.82s)]
*  So the way that the press is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=328.9s)]
*  framing it as like, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=330.38s)]
*  it was a preventative, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=331.46s)]
*  preemptive attack on their nuclear [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=332.66s)]
*  program. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=334.46s)]
*  No, they dropped tons of bombs in [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=334.98s)]
*  the middle of Tehran, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=336.42s)]
*  one of the most crowded cities [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  in the world, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=338.62s)]
*  But you haven't heard anything [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=339.98s)]
*  about their civilian deaths, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=341.02s)]
*  you haven't heard anything about [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=342.02s)]
*  any of that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=343.18s)]
*  because of course, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=343.74s)]
*  they're Iranians, not Israelis, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=344.5s)]
*  their lives don't matter. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=346.06s)]
*  So, but the minute Iran started [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=347.46s)]
*  attacking back, he'll go, my God, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=349.46s)]
*  injuries, tell me, injuries. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=351.85999999999996s)]
*  Injuries, you have to go in there [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=354.18s)]
*  and help Israel fight this war [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=356.34s)]
*  instead of Israel. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=358.34s)]
*  That's what the propaganda is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=359.9s)]
*  driving towards, okay? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=361.38s)]
*  So John's right about the piece of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=362.85999999999996s)]
*  propaganda of all these weapons of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=364.5s)]
*  mass death cannot be allowed to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=366.26s)]

*  Must attack a country, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=368.74s)]
*  especially in the Middle East, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=369.85999999999996s)]
*  if they're going to develop nuclear [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=371.29999999999995s)]
*  weapons. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=372.94s)]
*  If we had ideology, we would have [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=373.5s)]
*  wiped out Israel. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=374.85999999999996s)]
*  Israel has nukes, they don't, and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=375.5s)]
*  by the way, part of this is not [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=377.26s)]
*  just about, we're so [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=378.85999999999996s)]
*  worried Iran's going to hit us. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to tell you why that's [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=381.65999999999997s)]
*  ridiculous in a second. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=383.5s)]
*  No, it's that they don't want to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=385.34s)]
*  lose leverage. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=387.26s)]
*  If anyone else has nukes in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=388.5s)]

*  then Israel is constrained. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  They don't want to be constrained. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=394.14s)]
*  They want to attack Syria, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=395.85999999999996s)]
*  they want to attack Lebanon. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=396.9s)]
*  They want to keep Gaza in [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=398.21999999999997s)]
*  the West Bank, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  they want to attack Iran. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=399.85999999999996s)]
*  And they don't want to be [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=401.26s)]
*  constrained if anybody else [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  has anywhere near parity. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=403.22s)]
*  They might be slightly constrained [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=404.5s)]
*  from setting up greater Israel. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=406.26s)]
*  So later they will all pretend that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=408.02s)]
*  Israel was the victims, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=410.58s)]
*  not later, they're just doing it [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=412.46s)]
*  today. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=414.86s)]

*  poor, poor Israel. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=421.22s)]
*  What could they do? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=422.62s)]
*  Now, this next slide. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=423.18s)]
*  They were about to get a nuclear [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  bomb, you just heard it in the first [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=427.38s)]
*  clip we played for you guys. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=429.22s)]
*  No, they weren't. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=431.26s)]
*  They were at best a couple of weeks [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=432.85999999999996s)]
*  away, which sounds really close, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=434.97999999999996s)]
*  to enriching uranium for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=437.21999999999997s)]
*  the first time at a level where it [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=438.73999999999995s)]

*  Trump that if he does this now, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=692.26s)]
*  it will help bring Iran to [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=694.74s)]
*  the negotiating table. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=696.6600000000001s)]
*  Which by the way, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=699.22s)]
*  Donald Trump you saw, he said, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=699.86s)]
*  I told them make a deal in 60 days. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=701.3000000000001s)]
*  This is day 61, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=702.9s)]
*  they should have made a deal. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=703.58s)]
*  You better make a deal now. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=704.6600000000001s)]
*  You already had a deal. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=706.1800000000001s)]
*  And this new deal isn't that [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=708.0600000000001s)]
*  different from the previous deal. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=709.5s)]
*  And if we stuck with the previous [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=711.58s)]
*  deal, perhaps we'd have more [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=713.02s)]
*  knowledge about what's going on [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=714.34s)]
*  inside Iran and inside their [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=715.86s)]
*  program. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=717.4200000000001s)]
*  Now, as an Iranian American in [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=717.94s)]
*  the diaspora, I could tell you that [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=719.74s)]
*  a lot of Iranians don't like [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=721.86s)]
*  the government. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=723.5400000000001s)]
*  The government's an oppressive [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=724.0600000000001s)]
*  government and it's maybe not even [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=725.1800000000001s)]
*  a trustworthy government. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=727.0600000000001s)]
*  But nobody wants to go to war and [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=728.7s)]
*  kill innocent people. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=731.7s)]
*  So when I see the images and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=732.7800000000001s)]
*  I reached out to some relatives and [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=735.1400000000001s)]
*  just asking if they're okay, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=736.94s)]
*  one friend of mine said that he had [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=738.62s)]
*  been at the airport and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=741.0600000000001s)]
*  there was a lot of chaos but [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=741.98s)]
*  he was fine. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=743.1800000000001s)]
*  But we don't know the numbers, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=744.3000000000001s)]
*  to your point. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=745.86s)]
*  We don't know the numbers. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=746.4200000000001s)]
*  And as an Iranian American, again, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=747.9s)]
*  it has been exhausting. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=750.1s)]
*  It's exhausting to be Iranian in [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=751.54s)]
*  this world because the people of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=753.62s)]
*  Iran are really good people. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=755.62s)]
*  And the government of Iran is [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=757.9s)]
*  oppressive. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=759.38s)]
*  But then you get caught up in [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=760.38s)]
*  the middle of this where Bibi's [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=761.86s)]
*  playing Trump and [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=763.6999999999999s)]
*  Trump is going along. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=764.74s)]
*  And we're about to start World War [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=766.62s)]
*  III in that region. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=768.9s)]
*  And so, what can we do? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=770.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=772.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=773.06s)]
*  And I think a big part of this was [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=773.8199999999999s)]
*  Bibi had been seeing that the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=776.18s)]
*  continuing killing of Gazans was [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=778.5s)]
*  definitely in the world was getting [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=781.74s)]
*  more people were knowing about it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=784.26s)]
*  And it was another distraction to [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=786.54s)]
*  go, let me go after these guys. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=788.5799999999999s)]
*  And to your point, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=790.46s)]
*  they've got the backing of America. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=791.34s)]
*  And I don't know, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=793.9399999999999s)]
*  the thing that I always am perplexed [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=795.18s)]
*  by is these world leaders when they [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=797.78s)]
*  do these types of things, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=799.8199999999999s)]
*  it seems like they never think about [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=801.46s)]
*  what's the day after. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=803.9399999999999s)]
*  Because if you were to go and [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=805.98s)]
*  bomb Iran and bomb Iran and [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=807.54s)]
*  bomb Iran, what's the day after? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=809.22s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=811.4200000000001s)]
*  Are you going to find a way that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=812.26s)]
*  cause a regime change and [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=813.86s)]
*  create a democratic Iran by bombing [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=815.5s)]
*  them? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=817.34s)]
*  Is that what your strategy is? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=818.14s)]
*  What is your strategy? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=819.86s)]
*  So I don't see any strategy there [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=821.46s)]
*  except chaos. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=823.9s)]
*  And it's very worrisome for [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=825.14s)]
*  all the civilians that are going to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=827.1800000000001s)]
*  be harmed in such a war. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=829.62s)]
*  By the way, really fast, so [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=831.7s)]
*  apparently the UN ambassador from [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=833.22s)]
*  Iran says 78 were killed, 320 were [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=835.22s)]
*  wounded. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=837.46s)]
*  In Iran? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=839.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=840.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=840.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=841.14s)]
*  So but their civilians don't count [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=842.26s)]
*  they're Muslim, so it's okay. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=843.62s)]
*  And so, but the poor Israelis. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=845.78s)]
*  So I got to build on two things that [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=849.1800000000001s)]
*  Ma said. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=851.5s)]
*  So number one, look, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=852.0600000000001s)]
*  a lot of governments are terrible [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=854.78s)]
*  in this world, right? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=859.0600000000001s)]
*  Ranging from bad to despotic, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=860.38s)]
*  right? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=862.46s)]
*  So do any of us in favor of [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=863.22s)]
*  the Iranian regime? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=865.14s)]
*  No, no, I, then it's not a democracy. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=865.9399999999999s)]
*  It's a supreme leader, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=868.5s)]
*  I told fundamentalist, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=869.5s)]
*  no interest in it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=870.86s)]
*  They oppress their own people, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=871.66s)]
*  etc. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=873.14s)]
*  So that- [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=873.66s)]
*  We shared on the protests that [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=874.22s)]
*  tried to overthrow it just [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=875.18s)]
*  a couple of years ago. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=875.98s)]
*  Absolutely, we love that if it's [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=877.14s)]
*  organic coming from [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=878.62s)]
*  their Iranian people, right? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=879.78s)]
*  So does that mean we should go to [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=881.58s)]
*  war with them? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=883.26s)]
*  I mean, this is the same thing that [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=884.46s)]
*  they use in Iraq. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=885.62s)]
*  Saddam Hussein is a bad guy. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=886.58s)]
*  But Saddam Hussein was not a threat [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=888.62s)]
*  to America. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=889.74s)]
*  Where do we get the intelligence [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=890.38s)]
*  that they had weapons of mass [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=891.8199999999999s)]
*  destruction? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=892.74s)]
*  I hope you're sitting, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=894.18s)]
*  we got it from Israel. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=895.38s)]
*  And when they say, no, no, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=897.14s)]
*  Israel's a really big ally. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=898.46s)]
*  And I always ask how? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=900.38s)]
*  All they ever do is get us in [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=901.5s)]
*  a war so they get us into trouble, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=902.54s)]
*  get us killed, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=904.18s)]
*  get the whole Muslim world to hate [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=904.9s)]
*  us. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=906.22s)]
*  How are they an ally? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=906.72s)]
*  They say, they give us [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=907.42s)]
*  intelligence. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=908.26s)]
*  Yeah, fake intelligence so that we [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=909.18s)]
*  could fight their wars for them. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=911.22s)]
*  So with allies like this, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=913.18s)]
*  you don't need enemies. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=914.9s)]
*  Israel will create endless enemies [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=917.1s)]
*  for us, and [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=918.86s)]
*  they're doing it again here. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=919.42s)]
*  So for example, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=920.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't like the current leader of [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=921.8199999999999s)]
*  Turkey and the government right [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=923.98s)]
*  now. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=926.26s)]
*  I think that he's taking away [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=927.14s)]
*  democracy, I think it's terrible. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=928.66s)]
*  And a lot of Turks agree with me. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=930.8199999999999s)]
*  Do you think the Turks would then [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=932.8199999999999s)]
*  be happy if Turkey was bombed [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=935.1s)]
*  by Israel? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=937.22s)]
*  What kind of lunatic would say [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=938.22s)]
*  something that stupid? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=940.5799999999999s)]
*  No, all the Turks would be super [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=943.18s)]
*  mad. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=945.54s)]
*  They would all rally around [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=946.78s)]
*  Erdogan, which would make him much, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=948.22s)]
*  much stronger, not weaker. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=950.42s)]
*  And the idea that Turks or [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=953.06s)]
*  Persians or anyone would be like, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=954.68s)]

*  This is the stupid [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=962.38s)]
*  neocon philosophy that is so [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=963.62s)]
*  childish, so obviously wrong. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=965.78s)]
*  It's not they're not even trying [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=968.3s)]

*  And so Maz is right. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=976.5s)]
*  Look, I'll do graphic six from [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=977.98s)]

*  We're going to talk more about how [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=980.18s)]
*  US is getting sucked into this. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=981.54s)]

*  So, but in his long screen Trump [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=985.1s)]
*  when he's pretending and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=987.6999999999999s)]
*  the next story will tell you about [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=989.58s)]

*  on it all along. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=994.22s)]
*  He says, as long as I think there's [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=995.3s)]
*  an agreement, I don't want them [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=997.46s)]
*  going in referring to Israel, okay? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=999.54s)]
*  Because I think that would blow it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1002.06s)]
*  Might help it actually, but [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1004.34s)]
*  also could blow it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1006.26s)]
*  Now that was before the strike. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1008.1s)]
*  So he's told and this is now [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1009.62s)]
*  verified in 18 different ways. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1011.22s)]
*  Wall Street Journal saying he told [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1013.1s)]
*  Israel not to bomb them, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1015.34s)]
*  And then but the Israelis got in [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1017.9s)]
*  his ear and they're like, no, no. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1019.66s)]
*  You know what? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1021.74s)]
*  I know you want peace, Don. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1023.02s)]
*  And we all want peace. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1024.98s)]
*  But like, you know what though if [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1027.74s)]
*  we bomb them first that might [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1029.62s)]
*  bring them to the table better. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1031.26s)]
*  Now, any child would know that [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1033.86s)]
*  that's preposterous. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1035.18s)]
*  You bomb a country they're not [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1036.54s)]

*  Iran bombed Washington DC. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1061.74s)]

*  fully conscious sentient creatures [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1102.42s)]
*  then you can think whatever the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1104.38s)]
*  hell you want of them. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1105.98s)]

*  think whatever you want of them. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1109.38s)]
*  But on the topic of [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1110.94s)]
*  the negotiations, we should talk [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1111.9s)]
*  more about that because Iran has [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1113.74s)]
*  perhaps not surprisingly canceled [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1115.74s)]
*  this weekend's negotiations on [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1118.06s)]
*  the nuclear deal. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1120.18s)]

*  So that was probably obvious and [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1125.74s)]
*  a lot of people are wondering, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1127.66s)]
*  well, like the goal of these [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1129.54s)]
*  attacks were to stop Iran from [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1131.3s)]
*  developing a nuclear weapon, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1133.06s)]

*  the precipice of getting. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1136.54s)]
*  But if they thought they needed [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1138.5800000000002s)]
*  a nuclear weapon as a deterrent, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1140.3400000000001s)]
*  this kind of seems like [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1142.3s)]
*  confirmation of that. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1143.5s)]
*  Like maybe they needed even more. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1144.82s)]
*  And so there's concern that this [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1146.46s)]
*  could drive them to do anything [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1148.1000000000001s)]

*  we were right, they were going to [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1183.78s)]
*  attack us, the best deterrent to [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1185.78s)]
*  stop further attacks like this from [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1187.7s)]
*  Israel is go for the bomb. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1189.7s)]
*  I mean, just think about over [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1191.34s)]
*  the course of the last year, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1192.82s)]
*  the helicopter, the drone attacks [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1194.3799999999999s)]
*  from Israel, now the bombing. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1196.46s)]
*  Semi-regularly, Israel attacks Iran. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1198.86s)]
*  And from their perspective, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1202.34s)]
*  it's totally justified. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1203.42s)]
*  But from the Iranian point of view, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1204.34s)]
*  they desperately needed a deterrent. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1206.1s)]
*  And clearly, whatever conventional [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1207.82s)]
*  weapons they have, their military, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1209.7s)]
*  their ballistic missiles, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1211.5s)]
*  their drones, all of that, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1212.86s)]
*  that clearly does not deter an [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1214.26s)]
*  attack. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1215.6999999999998s)]
*  So if that doesn't do it, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1216.62s)]
*  what would? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1218.1799999999998s)]
*  Weapons of mass destruction is [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1220.02s)]
*  the answer that a lot of people [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1221.2199999999998s)]
*  will provide to that question. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1222.3s)]
*  And obviously, I don't want them to [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1223.5s)]
*  have that, but I think it's going [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1224.9399999999998s)]
*  to be a lot easier to make that [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1226.54s)]
*  case when you're constantly being [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1228.02s)]
*  attacked. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1229.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so one more thing about this [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1231.3s)]
*  absurdity about if we bomb them and [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1233.6999999999998s)]
*  we start murdering their leaders, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1236.1399999999999s)]
*  they'll be more likely to negotiate. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1238.74s)]
*  Under that logic, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1241.6599999999999s)]
*  wouldn't that say that, well, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1243.1s)]
*  Hamas was right to do October 7th [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1245.26s)]
*  because that would make Israel [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1247.6999999999998s)]
*  more likely to negotiate? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1249.6999999999998s)]
*  You see how dumb that logic is? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1252.54s)]
*  You would never apply it to [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1254.58s)]
*  Israel, right? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1255.86s)]
*  Well, it's a good thing Israel was [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1256.86s)]
*  attacked because then they're more [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1258.6599999999999s)]
*  likely to get to a peace deal. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1260.54s)]
*  No person in America would dare say [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1262.3799999999999s)]
*  that sentence. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1264.78s)]
*  But they say it about [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  the Iranians, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1267.2199999999998s)]
*  they say it about the Iraqis. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1267.86s)]
*  Yeah, they like being murdered, so [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1270.14s)]
*  that's more likely to bring them to [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1271.58s)]
*  the negotiation table. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1273.02s)]
*  Said morons who repeat [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1274.26s)]
*  obvious Israeli propaganda. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1276.14s)]
*  And last thing for me on this is, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1278.5s)]
*  they always frame it as, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1280.5s)]
*  they're about to get a nuke. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1281.8600000000001s)]
*  Jack Callahan, one of our members [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1283.7s)]
*  wrote in, so yeah, they're about to [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1285.26s)]
*  get a nuke for [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1286.9s)]
*  the last 41 years, right? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1287.54s)]
*  They should be listening in, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1289.54s)]
*  yeah, Ross, you better attack Iran. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1290.78s)]
*  I don't like Iran. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1293.54s)]
*  They're a slight challenge to me. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1294.22s)]
*  Maybe they could be a problem. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1296.38s)]
*  So just murder them, kill them, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1297.7s)]
*  kill them, attack them, attack them. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1298.98s)]
*  So what happened, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1300.7s)]
*  41 straight years? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1301.5s)]
*  You were lying for [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1302.9s)]
*  the entire goddamn time, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1303.66s)]
*  they were lying. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1304.8600000000001s)]
*  Now as I told you, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1305.7800000000002s)]
*  they were at least a year away. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1306.7800000000002s)]
*  But that's not the main point. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1308.8600000000001s)]
*  The main point isn't, should we [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1310.0600000000002s)]
*  attack them and start a giant war [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1312.3000000000002s)]
*  in the Middle East or Iran gets [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1314.22s)]
*  nukes? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1316.0600000000002s)]
*  No, or you do a peace treaty where [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1316.9s)]
*  you take their uranium out of [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1319.42s)]
*  the country and they can't develop [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1321.66s)]
*  military grade uranium and [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1324.38s)]
*  you get a peace deal. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1326.6200000000001s)]
*  That is the correct answer. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1328.38s)]
*  That was the answer that Obama [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1330.0600000000002s)]
*  gave. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1331.3000000000002s)]
*  That was the answer Trump was [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1331.94s)]
*  going towards. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1333.0600000000002s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1333.74s)]
*  we almost had it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1334.42s)]
*  And Trump, there was reports that [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1335.98s)]
*  Trump had made a deal. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1338.5s)]
*  But then Israel came in and said, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1340.38s)]
*  you're letting them enrich [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1342.42s)]
*  a tiny amount of uranium. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1344.0200000000002s)]
*  That doesn't get anywhere near, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1345.38s)]
*  like such a giant difference, guys. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1346.98s)]
*  I know it sounds like, well, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1348.5800000000002s)]
*  uranium's uranium, it's not. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1349.7s)]
*  Tons of countries enrich uranium to [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1351.98s)]
*  a point where they could use it for [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1353.7800000000002s)]
*  energy and it cannot be then [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1355.5800000000002s)]
*  militarized, right? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1357.46s)]
*  And the peace deal would have made [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1358.78s)]
*  sure that it technically could not [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1360.42s)]
*  be militarized, right? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1362.3s)]
*  So we had that deal and [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1364.46s)]
*  Israel came in and said, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1365.78s)]
*  I blocked that deal. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1367.14s)]
*  Donald Trump, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1369.02s)]
*  you're not allowed to make [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1369.5800000000002s)]
*  that deal. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1370.5s)]
*  They're not allowed to have any [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1371.42s)]
*  uranium because they knew that Iran [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1372.74s)]
*  would not accept that. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1374.26s)]
*  Why are they the only ones that are [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1375.0600000000002s)]
*  not allowed to have nuclear energy? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1376.26s)]
*  So since Israel knew that Iran [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1377.66s)]
*  wouldn't accept it, they're like, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1379.46s)]
*  good, so then we'll get to attack [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1381.7s)]

*  It's going to Israel. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1419.7s)]
*  It's going to their wars. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1420.74s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1421.7s)]
*  You can catch feelings over it in [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1423.58s)]
*  either direction, but [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1425.22s)]
*  it's a stone cold fact. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1426.46s)]
*  How many more hundreds of billions [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1427.8600000000001s)]
*  of dollars is Israel going to take [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1429.9s)]
*  from us to start more aggressive [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1431.66s)]
*  wars in the Middle East? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1433.3s)]
*  All right, Moz, last word on this. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1434.54s)]
*  They literally blew up the nuclear [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1436.26s)]
*  deal, they literally blew it up. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1439.14s)]
*  They killed the negotiator, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1442.82s)]
*  they killed other people that were [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1444.18s)]
*  in the deal. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1446.18s)]
*  And going back to Netanyahu, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1446.78s)]
*  Netanyahu was trying to convince [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1448.18s)]
*  Trump to not do the nuclear deal. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1449.66s)]
*  So you got to imagine Netanyahu or [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1451.42s)]
*  somebody within his inner circle [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1453.1000000000001s)]
*  was saying, hey, you know what? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1454.9s)]
*  Since we can play Trump like a pawn, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1456.5800000000002s)]
*  let's convince him that doing this [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1458.82s)]
*  bombing is going to help that [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1460.94s)]
*  negotiation. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1462.78s)]
*  Because famously, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1463.78s)]
*  Trump keeps saying that he's [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1464.74s)]
*  peaceful, he doesn't want war, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1466.18s)]
*  he doesn't want war, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1467.66s)]
*  he doesn't want war. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1468.6200000000001s)]
*  And here we are, we're in war now. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1469.74s)]
*  We are in the war, and it's so [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1471.7s)]
*  amazing how small brained Trump is [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1474.06s)]
*  to fall for this. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1477.1s)]
*  Because a strong Trump, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1478.7s)]
*  if he were strong, he would have [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1480.46s)]
*  told Bibi, no, do not attack. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1482.54s)]
*  I'm about to make this deal, and [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1484.78s)]
*  that will make the world a safer [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1486.74s)]
*  place, and we will have an ability [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1488.74s)]
*  to go in and observe their nuclear [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1490.94s)]
*  program. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1493.1s)]
*  And as you said, bring [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1493.66s)]
*  the weaponization out, and [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1495.06s)]
*  they can have a nuclear energy, but [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1496.7s)]
*  they won't have a weaponized [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1498.94s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1500.82s)]
*  And so that's what a strong leader [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1503.06s)]
*  would have done. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1504.9399999999998s)]
*  But on the other hand, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1506.1s)]
*  we've got Trump in office, and [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1507.3799999999999s)]
*  he just went along, here we go. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1509.2199999999998s)]
*  And perhaps he'll do what, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1511.34s)]
*  if you recall, with Russia and [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1513.1s)]
*  Ukraine, he said, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1515.1s)]
*  I'll have this solved on day one. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1516.34s)]
*  And here we are several months [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1518.82s)]
*  later, and he's kind of put his [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1520.4599999999998s)]
*  hands in the air and been like, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1522.06s)]
*  let him just figure it out. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1523.78s)]
*  And so similarly in this situation, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1525.3s)]
*  Jen, because you were saying, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1527.3799999999999s)]
*  we're just going to keep funding [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1529.1s)]
*  Israel, and Trump's going to say, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1530.94s)]
*  let them just do whatever they [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1532.9s)]
*  got to do, and we'll see where [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1534.5800000000002s)]
*  this leads. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1536.14s)]
*  And where this, unfortunately, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1536.74s)]
*  if you look at history, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1538.1000000000001s)]
*  where this will lead is to hundreds [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1539.14s)]
*  of thousands of innocent Iranians [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1540.7s)]
*  dying, probably several thousand [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1542.5s)]
*  Israelis, several thousand, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1544.3000000000002s)]
*  possibly several thousand [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1545.9s)]
*  American soldiers. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1547.3000000000002s)]
*  And it's going to be a repeat of [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1548.26s)]
*  Iraq or Afghanistan. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1550.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's what it feels like [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1552.22s)]
*  right now. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1554.02s)]
*  And so once again, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1554.8600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump was played by [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1556.1000000000001s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1557.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, super weak on his part. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1559.66s)]
*  And even a lot of [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1563.14s)]
*  MAGA is saying that today. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1563.94s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1565.14s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1566.66s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfVmp72-__E&t=1568.22s)]
