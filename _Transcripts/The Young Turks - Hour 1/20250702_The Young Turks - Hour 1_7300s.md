# Bigoted Repubs ATTACK Zohran Mamdani. Trump Falsely Claims Israel AGREED To 60-Day Ceasefire
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0)
*  MUSIC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=0.0s)]
*  I played baseball, but it was sort of slow. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=30.0s)]
*  Welcome to TYT, I'm your host, Ana Kasparian, and we have a massive show ahead for you all [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=78.08s)]
*  today. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=102.88s)]
*  We're going to do some updates on the travesty of a bill that's been dubbed a big, beautiful [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=103.88s)]
*  bill. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=109.28s)]
*  We're also going to talk a little bit about this back and forth between President Donald [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=110.28s)]
*  Trump and Jerome Powell, who of course is the head of the Federal Reserve. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=114.64s)]
*  Trump is very salty about the fact that Powell refuses to lower interest rates further. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=118.52s)]
*  There's a very specific reason why he has made that decision. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=124.88s)]
*  We're going to get into the details of that story as well. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=128.3s)]
*  And also, President Donald Trump claims that Israel has agreed to a ceasefire. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=131.0s)]
*  Israel says otherwise. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=136.72s)]
*  So we'll tell you where that issue currently stands a little later in the first hour as [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=137.88s)]
*  well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=142.04s)]
*  In the second hour, Cenk Uygur will be joining me to talk about more stories, including princess [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=143.04s)]
*  treatment in modern day relationships. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=147.68s)]
*  What is that and is it a good thing? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=150.48s)]
*  We'll discuss that and more. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=152.48s)]

*  watching us live. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=163.44s)]
*  All right, without further ado, let's get to our first story. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=164.44s)]
*  You see the numbers and we're sure we'll get into it of Gen Z and college educated Gen [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=168.4s)]
*  Z, college educated female Gen Z who are voting for this in New York. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=173.2s)]
*  There's a big portion of Gen Z that needs to go to American reeducation camps. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=178.66s)]
*  And I know what that basically means, reeducation camps. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=184.7s)]
*  I'm not talking about the really, really bad kind. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=187.6s)]
*  But there's a whole segment of society that genuinely needs to be reeducated on what America [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=191.0s)]
*  is and what America is not. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=196.76s)]
*  And America is not Zoran Mandani. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=199.04s)]
*  You're telling me that a democratic socialist communist jihadist is gonna be mayor? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=201.32s)]
*  Yeah, Adam Sosnick wanting to send Americans to reeducation camps simply because they have [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=206.68s)]
*  a different political or economic perspective makes it pretty clear that maybe he's the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=213.54s)]
*  one who needs a refresher course on what America really is. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=218.84s)]
*  And no, Zoran Mandani is not a jihadist. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=223.1s)]
*  He's just smeared as one by those who don't like the fact that he's ballsy enough to criticize [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=226.94s)]
*  Israel, which is basically a third rail among most American politicians. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=231.42s)]
*  For reasons that were actually perfectly outlined by Libertarian Congressman Thomas Massie. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  Everybody but me has an APAC person. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=243.7s)]
*  What does that mean an APAC person? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  It's like your babysitter, your APAC babysitter, who is always talking to you for APAC. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=247.06s)]
*  They're probably a constituent in your district, but they are, you know, firmly embedded in [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=253.48s)]
*  APAC. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=259.62s)]
*  Every member has something like this? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=261.42s)]
*  I don't know how it works on the Democrat side. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=264.38s)]
*  But that's how it works on the Republican side. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=267.62s)]
*  And when they come to DC, you go have lunch with them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=270.94s)]
*  I guarantee there's some spreadsheet at APAC where the APAC dude who's matched up with [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=273.22s)]
*  the congressman is there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=281.26s)]
*  And then all the congressman's votes on the issue. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=283.02000000000004s)]
*  Has the congressman been to Israel? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=286.06s)]
*  They pay for trips for congressmen and their spouses to go to Israel. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=288.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it works the same way on the Democratic side, just based on their behavior. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=293.86s)]
*  But nonetheless, Mom Donnie also happens to be literally the only New York City mayoral [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=298.42s)]
*  candidate who stated during a debate that he wanted to stay in the city to quote, address [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=303.98s)]
*  the concerns of New Yorkers across the five boroughs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=310.14000000000004s)]
*  Every single other candidate named a foreign country that they wanted to travel to immediately [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=315.70000000000005s)]
*  after getting elected as mayor. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=320.06s)]
*  Four of them, including former disgraced New York governor Andrew Cuomo, declared that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=322.14s)]
*  their country of choice is Israel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  And I know how hard it is for someone like Sosnik to understand because of the fact that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=330.70000000000005s)]
*  he has family in Israel, that most Americans actually want leaders who wanna take care [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  of business here at home. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=342.3s)]
*  Plus, New York City is still a Democratic stronghold and Democrats aren't exactly vibing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=344.1s)]
*  with genocide in Gaza these days. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=349.48s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo during the primary attack on Donnie is being insufficiently pro-Israel. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=353.14s)]
*  I'm not quite sure the former governor understood how much the politics have changed around [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=357.58s)]
*  this issue among Democrats. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=362.46s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=364.18s)]
*  All right, who Democrats sympathize more with, Israelis or Palestinians? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=365.38s)]
*  In 2017, the Democratic Party was a pro-Israeli party. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=369.86s)]
*  Look at this, they sympathized with the Israelis by 13 points, more with the Israelis than [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=372.58s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=376.26s)]
*  But look at this, see change. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=377.26s)]
*  Now Democrats sympathize more with the Palestinians by 43 points. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=379.26s)]
*  My God, that is a change in the margin of 56 points over the course of just eight years. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=383.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, I mean, when you get nearly two years of these insane images and videos showing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=391.34s)]
*  children being slaughtered, hearing stories and testimony from American doctors who risked [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=399.02s)]
*  their lives to go to Gaza in order to try to save people's lives. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=405.82s)]
*  When they come back and they talk about how infants, toddlers are showing up in the hospital [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  with bullet wounds to their heads, it's gonna start changing people's minds about whether [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=414.65999999999997s)]
*  it makes sense to support Israel at any and all costs. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  But nonetheless, I really do want to try to explain the rise of Mamdani, a Democratic [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=423.02s)]
*  socialist who does appear poised, at least for now, to win the general election and become [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=428.26s)]
*  New York City's new mayor. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=433.74s)]
*  His popularity really isn't that hard to understand because his campaign emphasized policies that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=436.1s)]
*  redistribute wealth and tackle the precarity American workers have been suffering. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  Rather than protect the status quo that has severely widened economic inequality, especially [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=448.02000000000004s)]
*  in a high cost of living city like New York. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not some fluke or an accident that young voters find Mamdani's socialist policies appealing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=456.72s)]
*  Mostly at a time when achieving what used to be considered normal milestones like buying [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=463.54s)]
*  a home is really out of reach for most young Americans. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=468.06s)]
*  Now look, the cost of living has exploded while wages have largely remained stagnant [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=471.86s)]
*  since the 1970s. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=477.38s)]
*  Homelessness, as you see from this video, has exploded across the country in recent [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=478.98s)]
*  years and it isn't rare to see makeshift structures housing people on the side of highways. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=483.14s)]
*  This is the richest country in the world and this is what we're dealing with. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=488.9s)]
*  Homelessness in the United States has been a rising trend for years, in fact since 2017. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=492.78s)]
*  According to data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, there were 771,480 [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=498.94s)]
*  people recorded as homeless in 2024, nearly a million people. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=506.5s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=512.02s)]
*  That represents an increase of over 18% from just a year earlier in 2023. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=513.48s)]
*  The data show that 36% of the homeless were unsheltered, that is they lived in places [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=520.76s)]
*  not considered fit for human habitation with the remainder living in emergency shelters, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=526.5400000000001s)]
*  transitional housing or safe haven programs. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=532.32s)]
*  By the way, this survey does not count people who live in overcrowded apartments or in government [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=534.88s)]
*  subsidized accommodation as homeless. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=540.96s)]
*  Mamdani's campaign made a point to address housing and more. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=544.76s)]
*  She even made a point to reach out to Trump voters to get a better understanding of why [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=550.2s)]
*  they decided to support the president in the last race. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=555.36s)]
*  And we didn't just win places that were considered to be progressive. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=561.0s)]
*  We won neighborhoods that voted for Donald Trump. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=564.1s)]
*  We won neighborhoods that voted for Eric Adams. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=566.2800000000001s)]
*  New York was the state that swung most towards Donald Trump, 11 and a half points. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=568.0s)]
*  And that swing happened far from the caricatures of Trump voters. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=572.2800000000001s)]
*  It happened in the hearts of immigrant New York City. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=575.5200000000001s)]
*  And when I went to Fordham Road in the Bronx, when I went to Hillside Avenue in Queens a [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=578.28s)]
*  few days after that election, and I asked Democrats, who did you vote for and why? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=581.98s)]
*  They told me again and again, they voted for Donald Trump because they remembered being [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=586.24s)]
*  able to afford their life four years ago more than they could today. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  They cited their rent, their groceries, their childcare. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=592.88s)]
*  And I asked them, what would it take to bring you back? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=596.22s)]
*  And they said a relentless focus on an economic agenda. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=598.48s)]
*  And that's what he did. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  Focusing on the bread and butter issues was a smart campaign strategy for Mom Donnie, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=605.3s)]
*  someone who clearly wanted to win, who wanted to touch the hearts of the very constituents [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=609.6s)]
*  who ended up supporting him. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  Especially at a time when the other Democratic candidates were preaching for more of the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=617.24s)]
*  same with maybe a few tweaks around the edges. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=623.0s)]
*  In fact, now that I think about it, Mom Donnie's rise really should not be hard for Trump supporters [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=626.64s)]
*  like Sosnik to understand considering their beloved Gulf Resort dweller paid a lot of [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=632.44s)]
*  lip service to the economic frustrations of working Americans as well. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=638.2s)]
*  It's just that Trump clearly wasn't serious about most of it or any of it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  The President's so-called Big Beautiful Bill ensures deep cuts to the nation's social safety [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  net that helps the poorest Americans, while the richest will get to enjoy even deeper [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=652.6s)]
*  tax cuts. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=658.24s)]
*  One of the biggest battle lines when it comes to the President's tax cut and spending bill [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=660.24s)]
*  are the cuts to Medicaid. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  And the very real impact those cuts will have on millions of Americans, especially in rural [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=666.28s)]
*  communities. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  Nearly 12 million Americans are expected to lose health insurance with this bill. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=672.6800000000001s)]
*  That includes almost 2 million in rural areas. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=677.32s)]
*  And one report estimates nearly 400 rural hospitals would be at risk of closing if the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=681.32s)]
*  proposed cuts go into effect. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=688.7s)]
*  Pretty sure that there will be some political consequences for this bill. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=692.58s)]
*  But notably the Senate version of the Big Travis Deva bill cuts $1.1 trillion from Medicaid [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=695.7800000000001s)]
*  and also slashes funding for SNAP benefits, food assistance. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=702.98s)]
*  While the United States is already spending a trillion dollars a year just to service [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=707.62s)]
*  our $37 trillion in federal debt, Trump's budget bill exacerbates that situation by [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=712.86s)]
*  tacking on trillions more in debt. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=718.82s)]
*  The tax savings provisions that would actually benefit ordinary Americans, like no tax on [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=722.6600000000001s)]
*  tips and overtime, well, that will be means tested. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=727.5s)]
*  If you're making more than $150,000 a year, you will not qualify for it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=732.38s)]
*  And those tax savings provisions for working class Americans are set to expire in just [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=736.62s)]
*  four years. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=741.86s)]
*  The tax cuts for the rich, don't worry, those are permanent. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=743.3399999999999s)]
*  And as less and less taxpayer money goes toward taking care of our own here in the United [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=748.42s)]
*  States, more and more gets doled out for Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=753.76s)]
*  The United States has provisionally agreed via a memorandum of understanding, MOU, to [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=759.5s)]
*  provide Israel with $3.8 billion per year through 2028. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=765.06s)]
*  Funding cash to Israel is the most bipartisan effort imaginable. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=770.5s)]
*  So let's actually start with the Biden administration. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=774.58s)]
*  Between October 7th, 2023 and November of 2024, the United States has enacted legislation [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=777.5s)]
*  providing at least $12.5 billion in direct military aid to Israel, which includes $3.8 [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=783.22s)]
*  billion in line with the current MOU and $8.7 billion from a Supplemental Appropriations [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=789.46s)]
*  Act in April 2024. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=797.38s)]
*  There are other estimates with higher numbers because these estimates actually take into [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=800.38s)]
*  consideration the cost of restocking American weapons that had been sent to Israel. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=805.5s)]
*  So Linda Bilmes et al from Brown University have reported that Israel received $17.9 billion [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=811.8000000000001s)]
*  in US military aid during this period. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=820.1s)]
*  A figure that additionally accounts for the cost to the United States Defense Department [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=823.3000000000001s)]
*  of replenishing the stock of weapons provided to Israel. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=828.1800000000001s)]
*  Not only does the United States largely provide offensive weaponry for Israel, American taxpayers [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=832.98s)]
*  are also maintaining Israel's defense capabilities as well. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=838.7s)]
*  Additionally, $500 million a year is slated for Israeli and joint US-Israel Israeli missile [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=842.46s)]
*  defense programs in which the two countries collaborate on the research, development and [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=850.3000000000001s)]
*  production of these systems used by Israel, including Iron Dome, David Sling and Arrow [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=855.5s)]
*  2. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=861.26s)]
*  Now, that's a pretty comprehensive list of taxpayer resources the Biden administration [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=862.26s)]
*  was willing to take out of your pocket and ship on over to a country that's been occupying, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=867.14s)]
*  persecuting and slaughtering innocent Palestinians literally for decades. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=872.1800000000001s)]
*  But there's a new stooge in town and his administration ain't any better. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=876.64s)]
*  On this matter, I mean, just take a look at what Trump has managed to do in the short [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=881.02s)]
*  time that he's been in office for a second term. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=886.6999999999999s)]
*  In March of this year, Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio put out a statement bragging [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=889.18s)]
*  about the redistribution of your wealth to Israel, writing that since taking office, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=894.02s)]
*  the Trump administration has approved nearly $12 billion in major FMS, that means weapon [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=899.74s)]
*  sales to Israel. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=905.68s)]
*  The State Department, by the way, also reported that as of April of this year, the United [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=908.2199999999999s)]
*  States has 751 active foreign military sales cases with Israel that are valued at nearly [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=912.26s)]
*  $40 billion. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=921.06s)]
*  That's 40 billion of your dollars if you're an American taxpayer. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=922.9399999999999s)]
*  USAID reportedly accounts for 15% of Israel's defense budget. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=926.8199999999999s)]
*  Israelis are dealing with a housing crisis, drug overdose epidemic, unsafe drinking water, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=933.06s)]
*  unimaginable economic inequality, a broken healthcare system and more. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=938.7399999999999s)]
*  Yet a whopping 78% of Israel's arms imports came from and were paid for by the United [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=943.5s)]
*  States. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=951.0999999999999s)]
*  No money for Medicaid, but endless funds for genocide. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=952.5799999999999s)]
*  So if anyone is wondering why all of these disgusting smears about Mamdani being a jihadist [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=956.8199999999999s)]
*  or an alleged anti-Semite, why they're not working. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=963.38s)]
*  Maybe it's because the candidate's economic priorities are shared by the very voters who [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=966.74s)]
*  helped him trounce Anthony or I should say Andrew Cuomo. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=972.14s)]
*  Refusing to serve Israel before the American people should not be controversial. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=977.62s)]
*  Refusing to prioritize New Yorkers as the mayor of New York City should be. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=984.66s)]
*  So that's my take on Mamdani. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=991.38s)]
*  And this is the winning strategy. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=993.66s)]
*  You focus on the issues that impact the pocketbooks of Americans. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=995.5s)]
*  Make their lives better, okay? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1001.26s)]
*  Don't feed into the BS culture war topics that are only meant to distract from the economic [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1004.1s)]
*  policies that Americans wanna focus on and hear about. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1009.86s)]
*  Focus on the bread and butter issues. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1014.18s)]
*  Focus on what your policies are and how you intend to make people's lives better. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1015.96s)]
*  There was a lot of that in Trump's campaign, regardless of how you feel about him. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1020.24s)]
*  And we all know that he wasn't serious about any of it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1023.6s)]
*  With Mamdani, I think there's a possibility that he is very serious about these ideas [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1026.54s)]
*  and that he intends to try to implement them. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1032.2s)]
*  Nonetheless, smearing him as a jihadist because he has the audacity to be openly critical [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1034.8s)]
*  of the genocide that Israel is currently engaging in is ridiculous to me. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1040.52s)]
*  And it's not working and I'm happy to see that. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1044.52s)]
*  We gotta take a break when we come back. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1046.56s)]
*  We've got a lot more to get into, including this supposed ceasefire deal that Trump has [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1048.44s)]
*  allegedly brokered and Israel has allegedly agreed to. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1053.92s)]
*  They haven't. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1057.68s)]
*  And then we'll also talk a little bit about where interest rates are headed in the United [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1058.72s)]
*  States. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1062.96s)]
*  Come right back. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1063.96s)]

*  Moonshine Dragon says, even if you're not on Medicaid, this bill will affect you. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1128.56s)]
*  Hospitals will close, nursing homes will shut down, doctors and nurses will lose their jobs [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1133.28s)]
*  and staff will be fired. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1137.96s)]
*  It's not just the people on Medicaid. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1140.58s)]
*  That is a good point. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1142.52s)]
*  And it's part of the reason why I chose that video showing how hospital closures are very [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1143.6399999999999s)]
*  likely to happen as a result of this bill should it pass in the current way that it's [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1148.8s)]
*  written and it looks like that will be the case. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1152.12s)]
*  Helen 007 says Cuomo's team darkened Mamdani's skin and lengthened his beard in their campaign [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1155.4799999999998s)]
*  ads. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1162.8799999999999s)]

*  AOC endorsing him seems to have broken Chris Cuomo's brain and he now spews disgusting [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  nonsense. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1171.3999999999999s)]
*  Wanting to make life easier for the working class is apparently a step too far. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1172.3999999999999s)]
*  Insane. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1176.6399999999999s)]
*  Helen, you know I totally agree with everything you wrote there. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1177.6399999999999s)]

*  And then he makes himself look really bad in doing so. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1191.8999999999999s)]
*  Maybe stop defending your brother. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1195.0s)]
*  Maybe your brother is a terrible candidate. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1196.24s)]
*  He's a disgraced former governor who made the intentional decision of sending elderly [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1198.84s)]
*  people who had COVID back to nursing homes so they can then spread it and a lot of people [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1205.96s)]
*  died as a result of that. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1211.04s)]
*  He was also credibly accused of all sorts of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1212.4s)]
*  I mean just disgraced in every way and somehow his brother is still providing cover for this [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1217.96s)]
*  guy publicly. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1224.52s)]
*  Maybe don't do that. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1225.52s)]
*  Anyway, let's go over to Sarah who says love your top Anna. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1226.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1231.76s)]
*  I'm gonna read this dress from the 50s. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1232.76s)]
*  It's a vintage dress that I barely fit into. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1236.36s)]
*  So since I was feeling a little slimmer today, I'm like I better put this on and make some [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1239.82s)]
*  use out of this dress. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1244.44s)]

*  It's just like, it's actually insanely gross how brazen and overt Islamophobia is in this [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1250.68s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1268.16s)]
*  I mean, I feel like that whole, I think it was Carville who said it's the economy, stupid [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1269.16s)]
*  or maybe it was Bill Clinton. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1274.36s)]
*  Carville worked for Bill Clinton's campaign. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1275.64s)]
*  Anyway, it's the economy, stupid. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1277.2s)]
*  We've been knowing this. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1279.28s)]
*  It shouldn't be that difficult. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1280.28s)]
*  Kevin says, Anna loved the necklace. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1282.44s)]

*  So stick around for that as well. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1362.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1363.76s)]
*  Well, let's talk a little bit about updates on a possible ceasefire between Israel and [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1364.76s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1370.8s)]
*  Don't get too excited though. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1372.24s)]
*  What are you gonna talk to Ned Gahee about next Monday? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1373.24s)]
*  Well, he's coming here. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1374.24s)]
*  We're gonna talk about a lot of things. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1375.24s)]
*  We're gonna talk about the great success we had. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1376.24s)]
*  I mean, we had an incredible success. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1377.24s)]
*  In Iran, we had an incredible success. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1378.24s)]
*  It was a great, brilliant strike. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1379.24s)]
*  And how did it go forward? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1380.24s)]
*  We're also gonna talk about Gaza. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1381.24s)]
*  We want to get there. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1382.24s)]
*  We want to get there. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1383.24s)]
*  We want to get there. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1384.24s)]
*  We want to get there. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1385.24s)]
*  We want to get there. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1386.24s)]
*  We want to get there. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1387.24s)]
*  We want to get there. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1388.24s)]
*  We want to get there. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1389.24s)]
*  We want to get there. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1390.24s)]
*  We want to get there. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1391.24s)]
*  But we're also gonna talk about Gaza. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1392.24s)]
*  We want to get the rest. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1393.84s)]
*  We've got a lot of hostages back. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1395.92s)]
*  But we're gonna talk about that. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1398.92s)]
*  Well, ahead of yet another meeting, another meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1400.72s)]
*  Netanyahu, President Donald Trump announced that he has helped broker a new agreement [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1406.56s)]
*  for a ceasefire, a 60 day ceasefire, which is just a pause in a genocide. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1412.44s)]
*  And he claims that Israel has agreed to this ceasefire, but have they? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1421.2s)]
*  Because right now, I think that your expectations should be tempered if you're excited about [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1425.96s)]
*  a ceasefire being agreed upon. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1431.14s)]
*  Now, on Truth Social yesterday, Trump posted the following. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1432.96s)]
*  My representatives had a long and productive meeting with the Israelis today on Gaza. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1437.48s)]
*  Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize the 60-day ceasefire, during which [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1442.82s)]
*  time we will work with all parties to end the war. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1448.2s)]
*  The Qataris and Egyptians, who have worked very hard to help bring peace, will deliver [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1451.8s)]
*  this final proposal. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1457.2s)]
*  I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this deal, because it will not [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1458.44s)]
*  get better. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1463.96s)]
*  It will only get worse. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1464.96s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1467.2s)]
*  Okay, how could it get any worse than every single building being bombed? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1469.24s)]
*  Every single hospital being completely and utterly destroyed, tens of thousands of innocent [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1475.36s)]
*  civilians being killed. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1479.6s)]
*  I mean, how does it get worse than luring innocent, starving Palestinians to humanitarian [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1481.24s)]
*  aid hubs only to shoot and kill them as they try to get their hands on some food to feed [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1489.3999999999999s)]
*  themselves and their families? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1495.1599999999999s)]
*  How does it get worse than that? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1496.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, when it comes to the Israelis and the Israeli government, I totally believe [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1497.9599999999998s)]
*  that it can get worse. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1501.32s)]
*  So I'll just take Trump's word for it. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1502.3999999999999s)]
*  But nonetheless, this idea that Israel has agreed to a ceasefire is false, okay? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1504.08s)]
*  So administration sources said that the deal was finalized after months of behind the scenes [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1508.84s)]
*  efforts led by a special envoy, Steve Witkoff, of course. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1513.08s)]
*  But as usual, it seems that Trump has gotten out over his skis. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1518.56s)]
*  So despite his statement, an Israeli source, this is reported by CNN, an Israeli source [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1522.32s)]
*  familiar with the matter said Israel had not approved the new proposal, which revolves [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1527.1799999999998s)]
*  around timetables and guarantees for ending the war, the critical sticking points in previous [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1532.6399999999999s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1538.84s)]
*  So I'm just gonna pause for a second so we can get caught up on all the context because [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1539.84s)]
*  this has been the situation since the Biden administration. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1544.6799999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu does not want to end the war. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1549.6399999999999s)]
*  And I really get mad at myself every time I call it a war because how can you even call [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1553.28s)]
*  it a war? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1557.8799999999999s)]
*  They're just annihilating Gaza. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1559.52s)]
*  Hamas doesn't have, it's not a country with a military, with the kind of military capability [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1563.6399999999999s)]
*  that Israel has. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1569.3799999999999s)]
*  The people of Gaza are trapped in that region, in that strip of land. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1570.76s)]
*  They're just completely being annihilated. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1574.52s)]
*  It's a genocide, so let's be clear about that. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1575.96s)]
*  He doesn't wanna end the genocide, okay? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1577.96s)]
*  He knows that the second he does, he's not gonna have an excuse anymore. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1582.12s)]
*  He has to go testify in his corruption trials. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1585.7s)]
*  He doesn't wanna do that. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1588.76s)]
*  I think part of the reason why Trump is trying to get the corruption charges against Netanyahu [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1589.9599999999998s)]
*  dropped is so he'll finally agree to a ceasefire. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1594.12s)]
*  How pathetic is that? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1598.12s)]
*  And by the way, who's the leader here? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1600.1599999999999s)]
*  I thought Donald Trump was like this alpha. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1604.04s)]
*  I thought he had some pride. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1607.28s)]
*  I thought he wasn't willing to get dog walked like other previous presidents have been by [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1608.28s)]
*  Israel. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1613.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, Biden was just totally embarrassed, humiliated on a regular basis by Benjamin [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1614.44s)]
*  Netanyahu, but Trump's allowing the same thing to happen. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1619.44s)]
*  They don't want an end to the war, okay? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1622.76s)]
*  And the sticking point isn't Hamas. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1625.3s)]
*  The sticking point has always been Israel. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1627.6000000000001s)]
*  So I really do take issue with the way that he framed this whole negotiation process in [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1630.64s)]
*  his truth social post. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1636.44s)]
*  Nonetheless, in other words, Israel does not want to end the genocide in Gaza. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1638.44s)]
*  And a source told CNN that this new version of a ceasefire agreement attempted to take [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1643.12s)]
*  into account Hamas's concerns with the earlier proposal. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1648.9799999999998s)]
*  During the ceasefire, Israeli hostages would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1653.7199999999998s)]
*  the source added, who by the way are also hostages when you consider the fact that most [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1659.52s)]
*  of them haven't been charged with the crime. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1664.02s)]
*  They never get to see a judge or undergo a trial. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1666.2199999999998s)]
*  They're just sitting in these Israeli prisons with no charges and no end in sight. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1671.6s)]
*  So sure, I guess you can call them prisoners. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1677.36s)]
*  But I like to reserve that word specifically for individuals who are accused of committing [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1680.4599999999998s)]
*  an actual crime. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1685.1799999999998s)]
*  Anyway, of the 50 hostages who are still in Gaza, at least 20 of them are believed to [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1687.04s)]
*  still be alive. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1694.12s)]
*  And as part of the latest proposal, humanitarian aid would once again flow through UN run [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1696.02s)]
*  channels rather than this just absolutely horrific US backed Gaza Humanitarian Aid Foundation. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1701.7s)]
*  These are the humanitarian aid hubs in which Israeli soldiers open fire and shoot and kill [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1709.8799999999999s)]
*  desperate Palestinians who are trying to get their hands on some food. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1714.78s)]
*  And more than 500 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid since the GHF started operating [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1718.42s)]
*  in late May. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1725.66s)]
*  Now Netanyahu is apparently planning to convene his full cabinet on Saturday night to discuss [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1726.66s)]
*  this proposal. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1731.74s)]
*  I'm sure that it'll be a good faith effort. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1732.74s)]
*  Hamas, which has been pushing for a permanent ceasefire as opposed to a 60 day pause, has [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1734.98s)]
*  not agreed to the deal either. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1741.66s)]
*  The group said it was studying the new ceasefire offer received from mediators in Egypt and [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1743.74s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1749.94s)]
*  Now Hamas official Tahir al-Nunu said that the militant group was ready and serious regarding [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1750.94s)]
*  reaching an agreement. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1757.46s)]
*  He said Hamas was ready to accept any initiative that clearly leads to the complete end to [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1758.98s)]
*  the war. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1765.46s)]
*  They've been saying the same thing for a while now, dating all the way back to the Biden [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1767.6200000000001s)]
*  administration. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1770.78s)]
*  But again, Israel won't agree to that because they don't want an end to the war. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1772.38s)]
*  Now a senior Hamas official said in late May that the group is ready to return the hostages [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1777.98s)]
*  in one day. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1782.74s)]
*  Just we want a guarantee that the war will not, I'm sorry, that war will not come again [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1784.82s)]
*  after that. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1791.74s)]
*  So again, they don't want a temporary pause in fighting. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1793.02s)]
*  They want this war to end. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1795.8s)]
*  And I think that that's actually the best option for all parties involved. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1797.64s)]
*  But Hamas delegation is expected to meet with Egypt and Qatari mediators in Cairo on Wednesday [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1802.3s)]
*  to discuss the proposal. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1808.22s)]
*  Trump meanwhile is scheduled to meet on Monday with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1810.3400000000001s)]
*  And he told reporters yesterday that he would be very firm in his discussions with Netanyahu, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1814.66s)]
*  claiming that Bibi wanted to end the war. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1820.18s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1823.1000000000001s)]
*  But here's what Trump said, quote, he wants to, meaning he wants to end the war. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1824.1000000000001s)]
*  I can tell you he wants to. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1829.3000000000002s)]
*  I think we'll have a deal next week. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1830.66s)]
*  But in his first public remarks since Trump's announcement of this alleged ceasefire deal, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1834.74s)]
*  Netanyahu made no indication that he intends to accept. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1839.58s)]
*  So it's unclear yet whether anything will come of Trump's announcement. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1845.1s)]
*  It really is reminiscent of all of the, we're so close to a ceasefire deal reports that [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1863.58s)]
*  we were getting during Biden's administration. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1868.0s)]
*  At this point, neither side has said that they're compromising on previous demands. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1870.52s)]
*  So we're right back at square one. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1876.12s)]
*  There is no indication that anything has changed or that we're anywhere near a ceasefire next [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1879.1399999999999s)]
*  week. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1883.82s)]
*  The only slight indication though of some movement toward an end to this war is that [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1885.3999999999999s)]
*  A Qatari foreign ministry spokesman told CNN the Israel-Iran agreement had created momentum [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1890.42s)]
*  for the latest talks between Israel and Hamas. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1898.38s)]
*  But that's it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1902.3400000000001s)]
*  The suffering people of Gaza desperately hope the deal comes to fruition. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1903.5400000000002s)]
*  Adnan al-Assar, a resident of Khan Yunus, says of Trump, quote, we hope he is serious [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1908.18s)]
*  like he was serious during the Israeli-Iranian war when he said the war should stop and it [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1916.1799999999998s)]
*  stopped. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1921.6999999999998s)]
*  But some Gazans, not so hopeful. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1923.1399999999999s)]
*  This is not the first time he has said this. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1928.34s)]
*  Since the beginning of the war, they've been promising us something like this. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1930.62s)]
*  Release the hostages and we will stop the war. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1934.1399999999999s)]
*  Every time they say the war is ending, the war is ending, they kill us. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1937.98s)]
*  The death toll rises and we lose more of our loved ones. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1941.8999999999999s)]
*  If they wanted to end the war, it would have ended a long time ago. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1945.8799999999999s)]
*  This war will not end, but it is a war that will end us. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1949.52s)]
*  Sadly, I think he's right. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1953.84s)]
*  So as much as I want to feel a level of excitement or maybe a little bit of hope that there will [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1957.58s)]
*  be a ceasefire next week, I definitely wouldn't put money on it. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1964.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna happen. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1968.9399999999998s)]
*  That's where my bet is and it pains me to say that. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1971.04s)]
*  The war needs to come to an end. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1974.72s)]
*  It's not a war, it's a genocide. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1976.14s)]
*  Innocent people are dying. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1977.88s)]
*  We as Americans are using up our resources to aid and abet this genocide in Gaza. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1979.6000000000001s)]
*  It needs to stop and it needs to stop now and it won't stop unless Trump is willing [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1986.04s)]
*  to be as harsh toward the Israeli government as he is toward Hamas or any other party when [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1991.76s)]
*  it comes to these types of agreements. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=1999.32s)]
*  Being Israel favorably has not worked out well in getting this war to end. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2002.48s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2006.92s)]
*  But again, I don't have much hope that there will be a ceasefire next week. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2008.0s)]
*  All right, let's talk about interest rates. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2011.32s)]
*  Fun topic, although Trump is having a tough go at things lately. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2014.56s)]
*  You were criticizing the Federal Reserve chair before coming to this summit. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2020.88s)]
*  I think he's terrible. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2024.76s)]
*  I was wondering if you've begun interviewing different candidates for the Fed pick. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2025.84s)]
*  I know within three or four people who are gonna pick. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2031.44s)]
*  I mean, he goes out pretty soon, fortunately, cuz I think he's terrible. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2035.0s)]
*  He's an average mentally person. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2038.3600000000001s)]
*  I'd say low in terms of what he does, low IQ for what he does, okay? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2040.8400000000001s)]
*  President Donald Trump is absolutely furious with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2049.16s)]
*  who has essentially defended his decision to hold off on lowering interest rates due [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2055.16s)]
*  to uncertainty stemming from the president's tariffs and trade policy. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2060.38s)]
*  Now tariffs, of course, are essentially taxes on imports to the United States. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2067.02s)]
*  And those costs are transferred over to US consumers, meaning it adds inflationary pressure [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2073.36s)]
*  to the market. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2079.8s)]
*  And as a result of that and over concerns that that will happen, Jerome Powell has decided, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2083.4s)]
*  okay, we're just not going to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates further. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2090.1s)]
*  We wanna wait and see. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2094.4s)]
*  That is his strategy here and Trump is not happy about it. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2096.18s)]
*  And you're about to hear why. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2099.7000000000003s)]
*  Instead of paying $900 billion, we don't wanna pay 900 just because he doesn't wanna lower [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2102.88s)]
*  the rate. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2110.78s)]
*  I said, if there's inflation in two years or three years or one year from now, you raise [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2111.78s)]
*  the rate, you take care of the inflation, among other things. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2116.6s)]
*  But he's probably a very political guy, I guess, I don't know. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2121.04s)]
*  I think he's a very stupid person actually. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2125.16s)]
*  The 900 billion that Trump was referencing there is the 900 billion that the United States [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2129.52s)]
*  spent last year in servicing our debt. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2134.4s)]
*  So we have $37 trillion in federal debt. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2137.52s)]
*  And when interest rates are higher, obviously that debt becomes more expensive. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2142.46s)]
*  He wants interest rates to go down, so our debt is a little less expensive. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2148.5s)]
*  Servicing our debt won't cost as much. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2153.8s)]
*  But it is a little bit of a problem, right? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2155.86s)]
*  That this so-called big beautiful bill adds another $4 to $5 trillion to the federal debt. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2158.94s)]
*  That's what he's thinking about. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2166.54s)]
*  That's what he's worried about. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2167.54s)]
*  And rather than do the right thing in maybe reining in these goodies that billionaires [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2168.56s)]
*  are gonna be getting as a result of that big beautiful bill, Trump has decided to direct [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2175.52s)]
*  his ire toward Jerome Powell, who's worried about overstimulating the market at a time [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2180.72s)]
*  when Trump's trade policies could lead to higher inflation. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2186.82s)]
*  That's what's going on here. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2191.18s)]
*  Now, about a week ago, Powell made clear that the Federal Reserve has decided to wait and [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2192.18s)]
*  see what type of inflationary pressure Trump's trade policies will have on the US economy. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2197.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2203.2s)]
*  For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2204.2s)]
*  of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2208.7s)]
*  Are we in a position where it would be appropriate to do something as big as a half percent cut [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2212.18s)]
*  again? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2218.9s)]
*  Well, look, as I said earlier, if you just look at the basic data and don't look at the [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2219.9s)]
*  forecast, you would say that we would have continued cutting. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2227.06s)]
*  The difference, of course, is at this time, all forecasters are expecting pretty soon [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2230.38s)]
*  that some significant inflation will show up from tariffs. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2237.06s)]
*  Now, and we can't just ignore that, but we're just saying let's wait and see more. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2240.86s)]
*  That's all we're doing. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2246.46s)]
*  And that has absolutely infuriated Trump. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2249.16s)]
*  So Trump's ever-changing tariff agenda has caused months of deep uncertainty for global [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2251.86s)]
*  markets and businesses, as NBC News reports. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2257.88s)]
*  Many have struggled to make predictions and plan ahead for duties that have shifted, sometimes [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2261.1400000000003s)]
*  with no warning other than social media posts by the president. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2268.1400000000003s)]
*  So it's not just that Trump is threatening these massive tariffs on goods that are being [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2271.6s)]
*  imported from our trade partners. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2277.6600000000003s)]
*  It's that he goes back and forth. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2280.2000000000003s)]
*  He waivers. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2281.78s)]
*  You don't know what he's actually going to land on in terms of his trade policies. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2282.7000000000003s)]
*  And so that uncertainty, of course, is making the Federal Reserve a little uneasy, and they [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2287.26s)]
*  wanna wait and see what happens. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2294.0600000000004s)]
*  Now Powell shared that sentiment on Tuesday this week when Bloomberg News anchor Francine [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2295.98s)]
*  Lacqua asked point blank if the Fed would have cut interest rates or cut interest rates [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2302.1000000000004s)]
*  more because they have actually cut interest rates a little bit. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2309.9s)]
*  But if they would cut interest rates even more if it weren't for Trump's trade policies. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2313.02s)]
*  Let's take a look at how he answered. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2318.54s)]
*  Chair, would the Fed have cut more by now if it weren't for the tariffs? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2320.34s)]
*  So I do think that I think that's right. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2326.54s)]
*  In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and where and essentially [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2328.46s)]
*  all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2333.5s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2339.26s)]
*  Now President Trump responded honestly how you'd expect him to. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2341.3s)]
*  We're doing well and as a country if the Fed would ever lower rates, we'd buy debt for [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2348.34s)]
*  a lot less. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2353.34s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2354.34s)]
*  This guy, I have a good idea. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2355.34s)]
*  I have a guy that's not a smart person and you're dealing with him and you have to deal [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2356.34s)]
*  with him. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2360.1000000000004s)]
*  He's not a smart guy. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2361.1000000000004s)]
*  A stupid person, frankly, at the Fed. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2362.1000000000004s)]
*  The only thing is we have a Fed chairman that is, he doesn't get it. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2363.5400000000004s)]
*  I'd love him to resign if he wanted to. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2368.22s)]
*  He's done a lousy job. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2369.9399999999996s)]
*  The president sent a letter to Jerome Powell essentially calling on him to once again lower [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2371.7s)]
*  interest rates to what he said should be 1%. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2377.74s)]
*  And he sent this handwritten letter on top of what was essentially a printout of world [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2381.2599999999998s)]
*  central bank rates from around the world. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2387.5s)]
*  And he notes on this letter that you can see on your screen that there are 34 central banks [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2390.16s)]
*  around the world that have lower interest rates than the United States. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2394.74s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, that's true. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2399.22s)]
*  Other countries do have lower interest rates. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2402.3799999999997s)]
*  Their central banks have implemented lower interest rates than the interest rates we [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2405.18s)]
*  have here in the United States. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2409.2599999999998s)]
*  That is absolutely true. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2410.5s)]
*  You know what's also absolutely true? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2411.8999999999996s)]
*  And this is something that Trump, who's calling Jerome Powell stupid, should probably take [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2414.16s)]
*  note of. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2418.48s)]
*  Other countries haven't slapped massive tariffs on imported goods that would lead to inflation [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2419.56s)]
*  for their consumers. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2426.2s)]
*  So there's a puzzle piece there that Trump isn't addressing at all. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2428.46s)]
*  He's treating all of these countries as if they're all being led by the same person who's [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2432.48s)]
*  implementing the same policies, but that is not the case. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2437.92s)]
*  And look, the leaders of those countries, again, they have different policies. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2441.88s)]
*  I don't know what the policies are for every single one of those countries that have lower [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2447.64s)]
*  interest rates than we do. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2450.7200000000003s)]
*  But I can't believe I'm saying this, cuz I'm not a huge fan of Jerome Powell. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2452.32s)]
*  But I actually do want to commend him for wanting to remain independent, not caving [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2456.48s)]
*  to pressure from President Trump. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2462.38s)]
*  And continuing in the path that he thinks is appropriate, given the uncertainty that's [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2465.42s)]
*  been brought upon us as a result of Trump's wavering trade policies. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2470.96s)]
*  And look, if you're wondering, okay, well, how are those trade negotiations going? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2476.24s)]
*  I kinda wanna give you a little update, wanna give you a little update. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2480.3599999999997s)]
*  I know there's been a lot going on in the news. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2483.0s)]
*  People haven't been paying close attention to these trade negotiations that Trump would [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2485.04s)]
*  have you believe are going really well. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2488.58s)]
*  But they're not going really well, okay? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2491.66s)]
*  So let me just give you two examples, beginning with Vietnam. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2493.6s)]
*  Those negotiations have concluded with Trump announcing Vietnam trade deal, 20% tariff [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2496.68s)]
*  on its imports to the United States. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2504.08s)]
*  You're gonna pay for that. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2506.16s)]
*  You the American consumer are going to pay for that. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2507.96s)]
*  There's more, Vietnam also agreed that goods would be hit with a 40% tariff rate if they [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2511.7599999999998s)]
*  originated in another country and were transferred to Vietnam for final shipment to the United [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2517.7599999999998s)]
*  States. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2523.24s)]
*  So what are American consumers gonna get out of that exactly? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2525.56s)]
*  Kind of hard to understand. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2529.52s)]
*  We're gonna pay more for goods that are produced in Vietnam. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2532.3599999999997s)]
*  We're not manufacturing those goods here in the United States. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2536.04s)]
*  Doesn't look good if that's the art of the deal. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2540.2s)]
*  I don't know if that's considered a good deal. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2545.44s)]
*  Maybe I want some bad deals cuz that's awful, but there's more. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2548.64s)]
*  Another big trade partner of ours is Japan, of course, and things are looking pretty bleak [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2552.18s)]
*  because Japan's like, yeah, no, we're not gonna cave to your demands. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2556.2s)]
*  After failing to cut a trade deal with Japan following weeks of talks, Commerce Secretary [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2560.24s)]
*  Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jameson Greer decided to turn up the pressure. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2564.4s)]
*  Okay, the Americans said they might demand a cap on the number of vehicles Japan could [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2571.56s)]
*  export to the US, a policy known as a voluntary export restriction. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2577.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, I'm sure Japanese officials were like, my God, we better give the US everything they [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2582.96s)]
*  want. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2589.28s)]
*  But the Japanese officials stood their ground. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2592.36s)]
*  From the start, they had told the Americans they wouldn't agree to any deal that preserves [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2595.26s)]
*  Trump's 25% automotive tariff, according to people familiar with the conversations. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2601.1600000000003s)]
*  On Monday, Trump appeared to cut off talks with Tokyo. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2608.2200000000003s)]
*  Art of the deal. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2614.9s)]
*  So here's a good way to sum up how things are going with these trade negotiations. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2616.9s)]
*  Administration officials attempting to negotiate multiple deals have at times contradicted [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2622.24s)]
*  one another about goals and timelines. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2627.0s)]
*  And Trump has further muddied the picture. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2630.6s)]
*  The chaotic situation has left Japan and other countries bewildered, unsure of what the White [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2633.8999999999996s)]
*  House wants or when they have to deliver a deal. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2639.68s)]
*  And by the way, just to reiterate something that I've been saying repeatedly while covering [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2644.4599999999996s)]
*  Trump's trade policies. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2650.4s)]
*  I am not necessarily against tariffs. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2652.08s)]
*  I actually think free trade has been pretty disastrous for sectors of the American economy. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2654.96s)]
*  I am open to tariffs. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2660.44s)]
*  This though is chaos, it's nonsense. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2662.68s)]
*  And rather than maybe do a little bit of self-reflection and pivot to a better policy, Trump is deciding [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2665.88s)]
*  to lash out at Jerome Powell for not being his little puppet who just lowers interest [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2673.12s)]
*  rates on demand. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2679.6s)]
*  By the way, Federal Reserve, of course, is supposed to be an independent body. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2681.22s)]
*  It's not supposed to be influenced by the Congress or the executive branch. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2684.72s)]
*  It is supposed to act independently. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2688.92s)]
*  Now Powell has repeatedly defended the central bank's independence, by the way. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2693.16s)]
*  And I should note that the Supreme Court bolstered the Fed's independence in a ruling just last [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2697.94s)]
*  month. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2703.92s)]
*  So Powell is defending the decision to hold interest rates steady, saying on Tuesday of [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2704.92s)]
*  this week that as long as the US economy is in solid shape, the prudent thing to do is [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2708.98s)]
*  to wait and learn more and see what the effect might be. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2715.2400000000002s)]
*  We haven't seen effects much from tariffs, and we didn't expect to by now. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2719.58s)]
*  We have always said the timing, amount, and persistence would be highly uncertain. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2725.54s)]
*  And asked about the impact of Trump's insult-laden criticism, here's what Powell said, quote, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2732.54s)]
*  I'm very focused on just doing my job. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2737.9s)]
*  He said the only two things that matter to him and fellow rate setting officials are [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2740.78s)]
*  full employment and price stability, the two sides of the Fed's so-called dual mandate. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2745.38s)]
*  The ECB conference attendees applauded his response. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2752.34s)]
*  Now Trump has also expanded his attacks. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2757.38s)]
*  He's not just attacking Jerome Powell anymore. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2759.98s)]
*  He's attacking the entire committee that sets interest rates, saying that its members should [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2762.2200000000003s)]
*  be ashamed, ashamed of their monetary policy. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2767.08s)]
*  Well they're not. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2771.12s)]
*  The board just sits there, he says, and watches, so they are equally to blame. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2772.36s)]
*  We should be paying 1% interest or better. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2778.06s)]
*  As for Powell's possible successor, look, he could remain as a board member all the [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2781.68s)]
*  way through January of 2028 if he chooses to. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2787.66s)]
*  But his term as chair doesn't end soon. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2791.56s)]
*  It ends in May of 2026, so he's got another two years, no wait, one year, it's 25. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2794.82s)]
*  So he's got another year at least serving as the chair if he chooses to remain in that [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2800.0s)]
*  position, refuses to resign. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2805.52s)]
*  And it would be a wonderful act of defiance for him to serve his term and then decide [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2808.48s)]
*  what he does after that. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2814.28s)]
*  But he shouldn't cave to Trump. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2815.92s)]
*  Trump should for once in his life understand what you do sometimes has consequences. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2818.2000000000003s)]
*  If you pursue a chaotic, ham-handed tariffs policy, there will be consequences. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2824.44s)]
*  And he's experiencing it right now, but just refuses to accept it. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2830.92s)]
*  Let's take our final break for the first hour. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2834.44s)]
*  When we come back, I'll do one more story and then we'll bring Cenk in. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2836.88s)]
*  Don't miss it, we'll be right back. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2840.0s)]
*  They dropped the load, the biggest load that we've seen. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2842.44s)]
*  Smash it! [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2872.44s)]
*  You ever played quarters? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2901.36s)]
*  Smash it! [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2902.6800000000003s)]
*  Rapid fire round of super chats, starting with Stinky Stinky Feed who says bigot's [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2911.6800000000003s)]
*  gonna bigot and then claim they are not bigoted. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2916.0s)]
*  That's in regard to various people referring to Zoran Mamdani as a jihadist or extremist. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2919.2000000000003s)]
*  My favorite is communist jihadist. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2927.0s)]
*  Let's put words together that sound scary to people. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2930.52s)]
*  Scandinavian alien dragon says if consumers have more money, then we spend more money. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2933.7599999999998s)]
*  If corporations want to make money, then pay your workers more. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2939.84s)]
*  There's a distortion in the market though and that distortion comes in the form of corporate [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2946.32s)]
*  stock buybacks. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2950.08s)]
*  So I totally agree with you. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2951.52s)]
*  I think the best economy is one in which the working class is robust, they have disposable [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2954.48s)]
*  income, they're able to go out there and spend. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2959.7599999999998s)]
*  But that's not the priority for our lawmakers. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2962.92s)]
*  Michael Catalano says what are the odds Trump uses any protest of Netanyahu as an excuse [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2966.7999999999997s)]
*  to enact even more of his draconian authoritarian wish list? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2972.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm not really sure. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2979.96s)]
*  Look, Trump does what Trump wants. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2981.64s)]
*  I think that's become very clear. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2984.52s)]
*  I mean, the only thing that has been able to stop Trump so far are the courts. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2987.08s)]
*  Congress has been utterly useless. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2991.88s)]
*  The Democrats have been utterly, the Democrats are so useless, okay? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2993.7200000000003s)]
*  And by the way, again, I don't mean the voters. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=2997.76s)]
*  I'm never ever, ever talking about the voters. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3000.52s)]
*  My heart goes out to American voters, regardless of who they vote for, to be honest with you. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3003.64s)]
*  Because what options do we have? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3008.1s)]
*  Okay, look at the Democratic Party right now. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3009.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, Hakeem Jeffries did this pathetic photo op with a baseball bat. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3012.6s)]
*  He's like, I'm gonna take a baseball bat to the big beautiful bill. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3017.28s)]
*  Are you? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3019.88s)]
*  Are you? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3021.28s)]
*  They're just completely useless. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3023.0s)]
*  And I get that they don't have majorities in Congress, but they have the bully pulpit. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3025.2s)]
*  And they've allowed Donald Trump to brand himself as a working class hero when he clearly [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3032.64s)]
*  isn't. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3037.64s)]
*  The problem is Hakeem Jeffries isn't a good public speaker, which is strange considering [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3038.96s)]
*  the fact that had Democrats maintained a majority in the House, he'd be the Speaker of the House. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3043.68s)]
*  Can we pick a speaker on the Democratic side that is good at speaking? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3049.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know, but anyway, sorry for that rant. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3054.92s)]
*  In guns we trust, even if they get a ceasefire, Israel's gonna violate it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3058.3199999999997s)]
*  And it'll never be reported on by the mainstream media. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3064.48s)]
*  It'll be reported on by us and DropSite News, which has been doing a fantastic job covering [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3067.16s)]
*  everything that's been transpiring in Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3072.16s)]
*  But I do take your point. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3075.2s)]
*  They chip away at these people by demolishing a home here, killing a family there, expanding [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3076.88s)]
*  settlements. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3082.48s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3083.48s)]
*  I mean, they're destroying homes in the West Bank as we speak. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3084.48s)]
*  Okay, well, welcome back to the show everyone. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3127.2799999999997s)]
*  We're gonna do it live. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3129.0s)]
*  Kate, I love that story. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3130.0s)]
*  We should produce it and do it on the show today. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3131.2799999999997s)]
*  All right, and Linens was a typo. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3133.04s)]
*  All right, let's get to our next story. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3135.12s)]
*  One of the things that was a lot of arguments about Trump that worries me very, very much [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3138.52s)]
*  is this movement toward authoritarianism. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3143.04s)]
*  And going after media, suing media, taking away the authority that Congress has. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3146.3199999999997s)]
*  When you say suing media, are you talking about the CBS lawsuit? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3155.28s)]
*  Among other things, yes. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3158.92s)]
*  But don't you think there's a real issue with what they did? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3159.92s)]
*  No. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3162.32s)]
*  You don't think that there's a real issue in editing conversations to give someone an [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3163.32s)]
*  answer that's different than what they really answered? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3167.8s)]
*  Last month, Joe Rogan and Senator Bernie Sanders had a pretty long debate about President Donald [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3173.0400000000004s)]
*  Trump's lawsuit against Paramount. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3179.0s)]
*  Now Paramount just agreed to settle that lawsuit for $16 million. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3181.7599999999998s)]
*  Technically, the lawsuit was about Kamala Harris's now infamous 60 minutes interview. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3186.48s)]
*  But there's a lot going on behind the scenes that you should be aware of. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3193.68s)]
*  It looks like Paramount wanted to settle cuz they were hoping to get some cookies from [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3197.68s)]
*  Trump's FCC. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3202.4399999999996s)]
*  We'll get to that in just a moment. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3204.7599999999998s)]
*  But before we do, let's talk about the settlement itself. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3207.08s)]
*  What it's stemming from, whether there was any credibility to it, and more. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3211.32s)]
*  So look, Trump sued CBS News specifically, which is owned by Paramount. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3215.2400000000002s)]
*  Paramount is the parent company for CBS News. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3220.92s)]
*  And this lawsuit was filed in October of last year. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3224.76s)]
*  Now his lawsuit came after CBS's 60 minutes released two different versions of an answer [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3228.0s)]
*  then Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris gave to a question about Israel. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3236.32s)]
*  Look, I think that both versions were bad. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3241.08s)]
*  I think that she was terrible in most of these interviews. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3244.16s)]
*  I'm just keeping it real. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3246.8s)]
*  One of the versions which was less edited had more word salad involved. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3248.68s)]
*  The more edited version was still bad, but it had less word salad involved. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3255.56s)]
*  So with that in mind, you have essentially Donald Trump thinking or claiming that the [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3262.08s)]
*  more edited version, which actually aired on television, the television version of 60 [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3270.36s)]
*  minutes, was edited specifically to give Kamala Harris an upper hand. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3275.7599999999998s)]
*  Essentially CBS put their thumb on the scale and tried to make Kamala Harris look better [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3282.48s)]
*  in order to help her defeat Donald Trump in the presidential race. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3288.66s)]
*  That is his claim. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3292.18s)]
*  So he files this lawsuit. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3293.18s)]
*  The more edited or the less edited version was like a promo clip that was posted on social [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3295.62s)]
*  media. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3302.34s)]
*  So both versions were out there. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3303.34s)]
*  But nonetheless, Trump thought that there was something shady going on in order to hurt [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3305.94s)]
*  his chances of beating Kamala Harris. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3309.02s)]
*  And as we all know, not only did he beat Kamala Harris, he won the popular vote. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3311.18s)]
*  And these types of lawsuits, in my opinion, are super pathetic, petty, unnecessary. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3315.66s)]
*  But the man loves lawsuits, so I'm not surprised that he's pursuing this. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3321.86s)]
*  Now CBS has opted to settle rather than fight this. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3325.86s)]
*  And I should also know one other thing, and this is what I hate about broadcast news, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3331.14s)]
*  television news. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3336.22s)]
*  We're kind of in the same camp, even though, yeah, we're kind of in the same camp. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3337.3s)]
*  You have time constraints. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3341.9s)]
*  You have to go to break. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3344.3s)]
*  You have hard outs, okay? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3345.5s)]
*  You don't have endless time like you would in a podcast to have these long form conversations. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3347.6400000000003s)]
*  So things unfortunately need to get cut out. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3353.6600000000003s)]
*  Videos do need to get edited down in order to ensure that you make the time obligations [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3356.98s)]
*  and go to the obligated breaks for commercials. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3364.98s)]
*  And so you should keep that in mind when it comes to television news. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3368.42s)]
*  Because again, it's different from what you would get online or through social media. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3372.42s)]
*  Now per the settlement, the money will go toward legal fees and Trump's future presidential [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3378.26s)]
*  library but not to Trump directly. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3384.1s)]
*  By the way, Trump's presidential library is gonna be like a palatial library from what [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3386.06s)]
*  it looks like. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3390.64s)]
*  I mean, the guy is gonna get a fancy plane from the Qataris for his library. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3391.64s)]
*  He's gonna get a $16 million settlement from Paramount that's gonna go to his library. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3396.9s)]
*  So it's gonna be a dope library. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3401.66s)]
*  Paramount will not be forced by the way to apologize for the edits. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3403.8599999999997s)]
*  And I'm glad that that's the case because I don't think that they did anything wrong [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3407.62s)]
*  here. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3411.1s)]
*  And Paramount also announced that they are going to release full transcripts of 60 minutes [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3412.1s)]
*  interviews with presidential candidates moving forward. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3419.98s)]
*  And I think that's the right thing to do and I'm glad that they're gonna do that. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3422.98s)]
*  So if there's a silver lining, that would be it. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3425.94s)]
*  I think it's important to release the full transcripts. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3428.3799999999997s)]
*  Now a spokesperson for Trump's legal team said the settlement is another win for the [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3431.08s)]
*  American people as he holds the fake news media accountable for their wrongdoing and [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3436.12s)]
*  deceit. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3441.08s)]
*  Again, both versions of Kamala Harris's answer were not good. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3442.6s)]
*  Okay, they didn't make her look good. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3448.04s)]
*  But okay, now as we mentioned, there's another angle to the story. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3450.56s)]
*  And I think this is the real reason why Paramount opted to settle as opposed to fight Trump [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3454.2799999999997s)]
*  in court over this. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3460.12s)]
*  And I do think that if they fought Trump in court, they would have won. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3461.16s)]
*  Now Paramount has a pending merger with Skydance Media. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3464.48s)]
*  And Trump's FCC would need to approve the merger in order for it to move forward. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3470.2s)]
*  So it's an $8 billion merger and it was announced in July of last year. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3477.54s)]
*  That proposed merger again is currently under review by the FCC. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3483.82s)]
*  So you can probably see how the settlement could look like a quid pro quo if the merger [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3488.52s)]
*  all of a sudden goes through. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3493.48s)]
*  In fact, the freedom of the Press Foundation, a Paramount shareholder by the way, had already [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3495.88s)]
*  threatened to sue the company's board over a potential settlement, arguing that it would [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3502.2s)]
*  damage the institution's reputation and do harm to its journalists. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3508.02s)]
*  Now in recent months, both 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens and CBS News and stations [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3512.4s)]
*  chief executive, Wendy McMahon, yeah, McMahon resigned from their jobs. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3519.78s)]
*  And they both oppose the settlement with Trump. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3526.7200000000003s)]
*  They think that it's the wrong thing to do and I can understand why that's the case. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3528.92s)]
*  But Shari Redstone, who is Paramount's controlling shareholder, has been basically pushing for [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3532.6800000000003s)]
*  the settlement. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3538.4s)]
*  The Washington Post reported in May, let's take a look. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3540.08s)]
*  Paramount is seeking government approval to merge with another entertainment conglomerate, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3544.48s)]
*  Skydance Media. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3549.12s)]
*  And a settlement is seen internally as a way to ease that process. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3550.64s)]
*  By the way, I do not agree with these conglomerates. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3556.2s)]
*  I don't agree with the mergers. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3559.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that the FCC should block this merger. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3560.92s)]
*  But now that Paramount has agreed to a $16 million ridiculous settlement for Trump, it's [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3564.36s)]
*  very likely that the merger will go through. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3571.1200000000003s)]
*  Edward Clarus, a media attorney, told the Washington Post that these kinds of settlements [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3573.7200000000003s)]
*  could lead to a bit of a vicious cycle, you think? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3578.2400000000002s)]
*  If you settle cases, you're going to send a message to your news team to not push the [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3582.46s)]
*  envelope for fear of people being sued. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3587.36s)]
*  And you're going to court more cases against your company because they might think that [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3590.46s)]
*  if they sue, or if they sue you, they're going to collect. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3595.38s)]
*  No, that's definitely true. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3599.86s)]
*  That's absolutely true. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3602.02s)]
*  I think that this is going to have a chilling effect on the way broadcast journalists do [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3603.5s)]
*  their jobs. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3609.86s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3610.86s)]
*  Trump has sued a pollster for getting a poll wrong. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3611.86s)]
*  He thinks that the pollster was trying to put her thumb on the scale by claiming that [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3617.46s)]
*  Kamala Harris was going to beat him in one of the battleground states. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3621.9s)]
*  You have Trump now suing CNN for simply reporting on an app that informs Americans about where [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3625.6s)]
*  ICE is conducting operations so they can avoid those areas. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3635.56s)]
*  CNN didn't promote it. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3639.58s)]
*  CNN simply and merely reported on it. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3641.98s)]
*  Now they're getting sued by Trump over that. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3644.9s)]
*  But a note that I'd like to give to anyone who considers themselves a journalist who's [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3648.34s)]
*  working in the field and might feel tempted to run for the hills or to play ball with [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3654.38s)]
*  Trump because they're afraid of a lawsuit. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3660.2000000000003s)]
*  Journalism isn't supposed to be and has never really been a glamorous job. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3664.62s)]
*  It is a difficult job. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3668.78s)]
*  It's a job where you're supposed to attract the ire of people in positions of power. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3670.04s)]
*  You're supposed to upset corrupt business owners who screw over the American people. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3676.12s)]
*  Being a journalist sucks. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3681.56s)]
*  Everyone hates you. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3683.48s)]
*  You anger all sorts of powerful people. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3685.04s)]
*  And if that's appealing to you, then you're meant to be a journalist. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3689.56s)]
*  If that's unappealing to you and you're always running scared, well then maybe retire and [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3693.68s)]
*  find another profession to work in. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3699.6s)]
*  Let the president sue you. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3702.12s)]
*  Fight back because the freedom of press is literally dependent on it. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3704.24s)]
*  Otherwise, yeah, pack your bags, go home, do something else, work in any other field. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3709.7599999999998s)]
*  But you shouldn't allow the president to have a chilling effect on journalism in a country [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3715.18s)]
*  that is supposed to value freedom of the press and freedom of speech. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3718.98s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3721.96s)]
*  When we come back, Cenk Uygur will be joining us for the second hour. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3723.6s)]
*  Don't miss it. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3726.64s)]
*  Get out of politics and get another job. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3727.64s)]
*  What contributions to the progressive cause are you most proud of? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3735.12s)]
*  I mean, I don't have super high aspirations for a singular role that I can play in the [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3740.64s)]
*  movement or anything. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3744.96s)]
*  I just, I try to present myself as what I think that I am, which is a progressive man [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3745.96s)]
*  by a, I think, well interrogated and well organized system of values that I try to stay [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3753.24s)]
*  consistent on. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3759.56s)]
*  And I demonstrate that that's the sort of life that a person can lead. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3760.56s)]
*  And be successful and be happy and all of that. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3763.74s)]
*  And that should not need to be done. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3767.04s)]
*  But there are so many people on the right that are trying to push men in the opposite [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3768.9799999999996s)]
*  direction that I wanna be able to do that. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3771.74s)]
*  Along the way, if I can get people to care about some topics that they wouldn't necessarily [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3773.8799999999997s)]
*  care about, or that for some men, they might think that's not a topic that they should [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3777.72s)]
*  be focused on. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3782.08s)]
*  That's definitely something that I relish doing. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3784.0s)]
*  And along the way, I mean, we've been able to introduce people to a lot of candidates. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3786.92s)]
*  That's been a big part of what we've done. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3792.04s)]
*  Not all of them necessarily got an office. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3795.88s)]
*  Probably most of them did not. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3798.12s)]
*  And a lot of them, you might not even remember their names. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3800.4s)]
*  But it was great to be able to provide people with a platform where they had the chance [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3802.7999999999997s)]
*  of making a difference. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3806.0s)]
*  Obviously, AOC and all that. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3808.2s)]
*  But there's been a lot of great people on the way. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3810.32s)]
*  And that's always been the critique that your critique of us is, well, you guys give [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3900.32s)]
*  good speeches, you put out good tweets, but you're not wielding actual power. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3914.44s)]
*  Now we're starting to. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3918.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3919.44s)]
*  Congratulations on all your success. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3920.44s)]
*  You guys are everywhere. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3921.44s)]
*  It's been a country and a principle, and that's what you and I both worked to achieve. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3922.44s)]
*  And I'm so glad that at least half the battle has now been won. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3925.8s)]
*  If you want to go really hear what's going on, honestly, you should tune in to The Young [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3928.2799999999997s)]
*  Turks. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3932.44s)]

*  Please keep it up. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3934.44s)]

*  The Dragon Squad awaits to join today. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3964.08s)]
*  I'd be worried about getting my ass blown out, right? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3974.64s)]
*  That is a weird way of saying it. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3978.2s)]
*  Cenk, you're a natural born athlete. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3981.12s)]
*  All right, back on The Young Turks. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3988.12s)]
*  Cenk, you were my- Michael, sure I was about to say, because that's the last show I did. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3996.08s)]
*  I was old school with Michael. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=3999.72s)]
*  Okay, I see you, Cenk. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4000.72s)]
*  Okay, well, Michael also shaved. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4001.72s)]
*  My dress isn't feminine enough for you today? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4004.24s)]
*  Well, we're going to talk about princess treatment a little bit later in the show. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4006.3199999999997s)]
*  That's actually one of my favorite topics today. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4009.3199999999997s)]
*  So I think you guys are going to love that story. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4011.7599999999998s)]
*  princess treatment, or is it terrible for men, for women, etc.? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4014.52s)]
*  What is it? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4019.52s)]
*  We'll explain in a minute. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4020.52s)]
*  And then of course, we got attacks against Zoran Mumdani coming up in this hour. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4021.64s)]
*  Of course, what's new? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4026.12s)]
*  And by the way, KM, thank you for joining. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4030.04s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4031.72s)]
*  They had that big beautiful button below the video on YouTube, and you can join the TYT.com. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4032.72s)]
*  Okay, so lots to get to. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4038.28s)]
*  Casper, why don't we get started? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4040.24s)]
*  Let's get started with this. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4042.32s)]
*  He is rejecting what we have developed as Western civilization. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4045.76s)]
*  People say, well, he's just being himself. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4049.6400000000003s)]
*  He's so authentic. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4051.0800000000004s)]
*  Okay, if a third worlder comes and starts defecating on the side of the street in Times [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4052.0800000000004s)]
*  Square, are we going to say, boy, that is, he's being his true and authentic self. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4055.84s)]
*  He's really being wonderful. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4061.88s)]
*  No, we have standards in the West. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4063.88s)]
*  He's just like, hey, let's put root beer in all the drinking fountains. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4065.96s)]
*  Everything will be free. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4069.04s)]
*  Look at how I eat my burrito with my fingers. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4070.44s)]
*  My God. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4073.96s)]
*  We have standards in the West. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4076.52s)]
*  Does Charlie Kirk not know that there are homegrown Americans defecating on the side [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4080.4s)]
*  of the street right now? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4085.68s)]
*  No, I gotta jump in. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4086.68s)]
*  Because so I originally came from Turkey when I was eight years old, and Turkey is not a [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4087.68s)]
*  developing country. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4092.84s)]
*  Well, you could make arguments, but it's a top 20 economy, okay? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4093.84s)]
*  So- [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4097.6s)]
*  I love when your Turkish pride comes out. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4098.6s)]
*  Okay, but my point is, it's not America, it's not Germany, Japan, etc., okay? [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4100.64s)]
*  No one would ever, ever defecate in the streets, and it would be horrifying. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4108.28s)]
*  Whereas in LA, New York, and San Francisco, I've seen feces all over the streets, all [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4114.56s)]
*  over the streets, right around the corner from my house. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4120.04s)]
*  We would never tolerate it in the West. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4122.36s)]
*  We have standards here in the West. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4123.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4125.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4126.92s)]
*  I've never seen human feces on the sidewalk more in any other country than America. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4127.92s)]
*  And my guess is Charlie Kirk would be opposed to that as well. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4134.84s)]
*  But the idea that it doesn't happen here, but all those third-worlders do it is hilarious. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4137.56s)]
*  But only matched by the hilarious comment by Chaffetz there on Fox News. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4141.84s)]
*  He's like, next thing you know, he's gonna try to get us to eat burritos with our hands. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4146.76s)]
*  They're gonna make you drink Starbucks every single day until you die. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4153.52s)]
*  Do you remember when Tiger said that? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4157.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4159.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4160.24s)]
*  Okay, come on. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4161.24s)]
*  And then pizza, burgers, and sandwiches, and donuts, all of that with your hands. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4162.24s)]
*  Can you believe they're gonna do that to Western culture? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4166.16s)]
*  So look, in what can only be described as giving Obama in a tan suit vibes, the latest [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4169.48s)]
*  culture war in America is about New York City mayoral candidate, Zeron Mamdani, eating rice [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4177.34s)]
*  with his hands. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4184.08s)]
*  And now look, I'm just gonna say this. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4185.44s)]
*  Number one, I prefer to eat rice with a fork, but I don't care about how Mamdani eats his [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4187.48s)]
*  rice. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4195.24s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4196.24s)]
*  I don't care if he eats it on a boat. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4197.24s)]
*  I don't care if he eats it on a goat. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4198.24s)]
*  It doesn't matter to me. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4199.639999999999s)]
*  But it really, really matters to the right wing. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4201.5599999999995s)]
*  So let's watch a video that kicked off all this outrage, and then we'll go to all of [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4203.759999999999s)]
*  the crazy right wingers who are obsessed with this story. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4208.599999999999s)]
*  Tell me, why is Palestine a part of your politics? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4214.2s)]
*  When you grow up as someone, especially in the third world, you have a very different [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4217.599999999999s)]
*  understanding of the Palestinian struggle. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4223.2s)]
*  It is one that is framed in terms of empathy and solidarity. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4225.16s)]
*  Specifically growing up in South Africa post-apartheid, it felt as if one of the most natural things [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4229.08s)]
*  to wear around my body was a kifeye. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4234.82s)]
*  And so then to get here and see all of a sudden this topic was not only one that was discussed [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4237.08s)]
*  very differently, but was entirely taboo. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4242.8s)]
*  It was a shock to my system. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4246.12s)]
*  And for me, what made it central to my identity is that it is a glaring contradiction. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4247.46s)]
*  We say we care about freedom and justice and self-determination. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4252.360000000001s)]
*  And yet for some reason, we draw a line when it comes to Palestinians that accept them. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4256.04s)]
*  So none of the right wingers that we're about to talk about addressed any of the substance [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4261.860000000001s)]
*  in what Mamdani had to say there? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4270.52s)]
*  Of course not, I could day with those barbaric acts. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4272.48s)]
*  That was a slightly different way of eating than me. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4276.719999999999s)]
*  Did you know that Chinese folks, a lot of them have soup for breakfast? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4280.879999999999s)]
*  What is wrong with them? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4285.28s)]
*  I hate them. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4286.679999999999s)]
*  I love soup for breakfast. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4287.679999999999s)]
*  So what? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4289.5199999999995s)]
*  Why would it possibly matter? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4291.28s)]
*  They also eat with sticks. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4292.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they eat with sticks. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4295.08s)]
*  What's wrong with them, the barbarians? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4297.679999999999s)]
*  Okay, so they eat slightly differently. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4300.6s)]
*  Okay, no, but I can't stop going back to Chaffetz. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4303.52s)]
*  I think that guy is hilarious. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4308.200000000001s)]
*  Okay, normally we eat burritos with fork and knife here in America. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4310.200000000001s)]
*  Afterwards, we have tea and crumpets. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4315.88s)]
*  But this barbarian would have us just pick up the burrito with our bare hands. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4318.280000000001s)]
*  And in New York of all places, I've never seen anyone eat with their bare hands in New [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4323.240000000001s)]
*  York. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4328.160000000001s)]
*  You eat pizza, everything in New York, you eat with your bare hands, but okay. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4329.16s)]
*  Okay, we also live in America that's about to celebrate the 4th of July. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4332.72s)]
*  Can't wait, excited. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4336.96s)]
*  One of the big items that people like to consume on the 4th of July, hot dogs. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4338.32s)]
*  It's my favorite meat. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4343.88s)]
*  Well, some of those hot dogs. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4344.88s)]
*  Once you find out what's in the hot dogs, you're not gonna find it so appetizing. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4347.76s)]
*  Maybe you would prefer to eat the rice with your hands as opposed to eat the hot dogs. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4352.4s)]
*  Does Charlie eat the hot dog with a fork and knife? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4355.599999999999s)]
*  I do declare, yes. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4357.84s)]
*  I have some condiments with it though. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4358.84s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4361.12s)]
*  So this story is hilarious. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4362.12s)]
*  The ensuing culture war is, I mean, let's just go to the video. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4363.96s)]
*  So here's Charlie Kirk explaining why he believes it's a signal of the third world coming to [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4368.84s)]
*  overtake New York. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4376.72s)]
*  Let's watch. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4379.32s)]
*  We in the West value cleanliness. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4381.18s)]
*  We have utensils, we teach our kids to use utensils. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4383.96s)]
*  They say, well, what about burgers and pizza? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4386.64s)]
*  Yeah, that food is designed that way. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4388.240000000001s)]
*  Rice, since we have utensils, you don't eat it because we're not in the third world with [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4390.200000000001s)]
*  your hands. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4394.68s)]
*  He's doing this to signal his third world cred. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4395.68s)]
*  So think about it. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4397.96s)]
*  To get credibility in the New York mayor's race, you have to pretend to be in the third [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4398.96s)]
*  world. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4403.8s)]
*  People say, well, he's just being himself. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4404.8s)]
*  He's so authentic. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4405.8s)]
*  Okay, if a third worlder comes and starts defecating on the side of the street in Times Square, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4406.8s)]
*  are we gonna say, boy, that is, he's being his true and authentic self. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4411.280000000001s)]
*  He's really being wonderful. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4416.56s)]
*  No, we have standards in the West. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4418.6s)]
*  And in some of the comments of a TikTok video I made, people said, but Charlie, who are [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4420.68s)]
*  you to judge other cultures? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4423.76s)]
*  No, no, no, that's the point. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4425.200000000001s)]
*  We in Western culture believe that our way of life is the best. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4427.6s)]
*  We're better than Muhammadism. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4431.04s)]
*  I really wanna do like brain scans of conservatives and just bring up random utensils, right? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4434.280000000001s)]
*  Because they do seem obsessed with utensils. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4440.6s)]
*  You have Jesse Waters doing multiple segments about how men should never use straws or eat [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4443.92s)]
*  soup. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4450.0s)]
*  In public. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4451.0s)]
*  In public. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4452.0s)]
*  In the shame of your private home, you could have soup, right? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4453.0s)]
*  And he said French onion soup, especially with the cheese and stuff, so gay, right? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4457.280000000001s)]
*  But in your basement, you could be like, my God, I'm so bi, right? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4461.84s)]
*  Just go nuts. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4466.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4467.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4468.68s)]
*  I just wanted, I needed some comedic relief, so I really do wanna thank all the various [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4469.68s)]
*  conservatives who are flipping out in this story. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4474.6s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4476.88s)]
*  It's just a couple things on what Charlie just said there. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4477.88s)]
*  Okay, so number one, so burgers and pizza, they're designed to eat with your hands. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4480.2s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4485.64s)]
*  Yeah, because that's what Lord Burger decided back in the day in Hamburger, where he was [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4486.64s)]
*  like, you know what, I'm going to design this to eat with your hands, unlike rice, okay? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4492.24s)]
*  So rice, by the way, what is it designed to be eaten with? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4497.84s)]
*  Because Chinese eat it with chopsticks. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4500.66s)]
*  They do. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4502.12s)]
*  And they think that they're crazy for eating it with a fork. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4503.12s)]
*  They think it's totally inefficient. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4505.52s)]
*  Well, they're wrong. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4506.52s)]
*  They're wrong. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4507.52s)]
*  Okay, so and then I just had rice upstairs. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4508.52s)]
*  You know how I ate it? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4510.56s)]
*  No, I ate it with a spoon. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4513.56s)]
*  Because actually, it's easier to pick up with a spoon. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4516.360000000001s)]
*  Am I also now, am I a third-worlder or am I above the first world? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4518.6s)]
*  Because a spoon is more efficient than a fork. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4525.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, come on, this is, come on. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4527.679999999999s)]
*  I think this is more important than housing or healthcare. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4529.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm glad we're finally adjudicating this topic. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4532.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and so look, my friends of mine growing up who were Indian, sometimes, especially [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4535.16s)]
*  when they were with their parents, etc., would eat with their hands. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4542.639999999999s)]
*  And they were trying to be culturally sensitive to their background, right? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4546.5199999999995s)]
*  And to the elders of their family, etc. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4550.32s)]
*  They eat that way when we were out at Denny's, no, right? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4553.0s)]
*  But even though I didn't experience anyone eating with their hands growing up until I [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4557.88s)]
*  saw my friends doing it, my head didn't explode. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4563.8s)]
*  I instantly understood, that's a slightly different culture, right? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4567.28s)]
*  In different cultures, they eat in ways that we're not as familiar with. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4572.16s)]
*  And then that was followed with a giant, so what? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4577.52s)]
*  Yeah, and then you moved on with your life, that was it. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4581.2s)]
*  So Congressman Brandon Gill says, civilized people in America don't eat like this. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4584.2s)]
*  If you refuse to adopt Western customs, go back to the third world. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4589.42s)]
*  Look, I would agree with the statement like that if we're talking about honor killings [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4594.719999999999s)]
*  or something. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4600.8s)]
*  But that's not what we're talking about. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4601.8s)]
*  We're literally talking about a guy who decided to eat rice with his hands. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4602.86s)]
*  Doesn't mean I have to eat rice with my hands, doesn't mean Cenk does, doesn't mean anyone [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4606.48s)]
*  does. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4609.76s)]
*  Yeah, so that's as, now we're onto a serious topic, an important and interesting topic, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4610.76s)]
*  because nobody ever makes this distinction and it drives me crazy. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4614.0s)]
*  The difference between people of a certain background, like all Muslims, all Indians, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4617.2s)]
*  all anything, right? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4623.360000000001s)]
*  Versus culture, and so I believe that you can comment on culture, you can criticize [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4624.8s)]
*  culture. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4631.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4632.96s)]
*  So no, but a lot of folks on, and I don't mean this in any of the recent ways, but some [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4633.96s)]
*  folks being trying to be extra sensitive on the left, say no, no, no, you can't judge [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4638.48s)]
*  cultures like that. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4643.12s)]
*  It's all relative, right? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4644.879999999999s)]
*  I do it all the time. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4645.879999999999s)]
*  No, no, it's relative when it's things that are like a matter of habit, tradition, etc. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4646.879999999999s)]
*  That don't hurt anyone else, that are irrelevant, etc., right? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4653.28s)]
*  What kind of outfit you wear, why do I care? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4657.08s)]
*  I mean, go nuts, right? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4659.08s)]
*  I mean, I care a little bit. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4660.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay, I mean, look, so like the Orthodox Jewish folks who wear the giant Russian outfits on [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4661.879999999999s)]
*  Miami Beach, like this 1800 winter coat. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4667.44s)]
*  I mean, he's like drenched in sweat, he makes me look like I'm dry, okay? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4670.12s)]
*  So I don't get it, and I think it's kind of funny, but so what? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4674.759999999999s)]
*  That brother likes that outfit, let him sweat his ass off, who cares? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4680.2s)]
*  Okay, so but my point is, to your point, Ana, is that there are different cultural things [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4683.5599999999995s)]
*  that are outside of bounds. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4689.16s)]
*  And so for example, this is such an obvious and easy one. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4691.719999999999s)]
*  So we covered a story many years ago on TYT about Central Asian Republics and how there [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4696.2s)]
*  was a very old tradition. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4700.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4702.679999999999s)]
*  Because of the Central Asian steps, they were basically herders. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4703.679999999999s)]
*  This is also true in Scotland back in the day. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4705.96s)]
*  And so it would lead to a lot of tribal warfare, cuz it's easier to steal sheep than it is [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4709.36s)]
*  to steal land and then farm it, right? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4713.599999999999s)]
*  So at least a culture that does more raids, etc. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4716.58s)]
*  So now the part back to Central Asian Republic, they used to do raids and steal the other [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4721.4s)]
*  tribes women. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4725.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4727.139999999999s)]
*  So there's still a tradition that's very almost gone now, and hopefully soon it will be gone. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4728.139999999999s)]
*  But one or two guys still do it once a decade or something, where they go and grab some [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4733.639999999999s)]
*  poor woman and then they sexually assault her. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4737.82s)]
*  And then the parents of the woman come by and convince the woman to marry the guy. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4741.46s)]
*  Yeah, and it has to do with, look, this stuff really does gross me out. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4746.58s)]
*  I do judge, negatively judge, cultures that put this super high value on virginity. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4751.62s)]
*  But it's about virginity, right? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4759.74s)]
*  After she's been assaulted, basically raped. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4761.1s)]
*  Yeah, let's get, keep it real. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4764.66s)]
*  So what they- [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4767.54s)]
*  She's no longer pure and she has no choice but to marry. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4768.54s)]
*  It's slightly worse than that. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4772.62s)]
*  All that is true, plus they think she had value before. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4773.94s)]
*  We could get a dowry, etc. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4777.9s)]
*  She now has no value. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4780.32s)]
*  I hate all of this stuff. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4781.84s)]
*  Okay, so- [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4782.84s)]
*  Yeah, it disgusts me. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4783.84s)]
*  So if we're talking about something like that, have at it, Hoss, as Jake would say. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4784.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4788.88s)]
*  I don't mind judging that, but do conservatives or right wingers who hate Mom Donnie have [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4789.88s)]
*  any substantive critique? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4797.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4799.2s)]
*  They don't talk about his policies, nothing. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4800.2s)]
*  And whereas actually there's a lot to talk about his economic policies, tons and tons [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4803.5199999999995s)]
*  as some do, to be fair, right? [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4807.24s)]
*  And okay, so now guys, the reason I gave you that example is so you can see that rational [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4809.2s)]
*  people make rational distinctions, right? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4814.599999999999s)]
*  Things that are important and things that are not at all important. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4817.88s)]
*  And this is another huge thing. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4821.12s)]
*  If you then said, okay, everybody that's from Central Asia, Republic Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4822.36s)]
*  whatever, they're all rapists and they're all, no, that's not true. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4827.599999999999s)]
*  It's a tiny, tiny leftover part of the culture. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4830.48s)]
*  Was it part of the culture hundreds of years ago? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4833.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4835.72s)]
*  Does it mean that it should stay in your culture? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4836.72s)]
*  Is it okay to say, hey, some parts of culture, of any culture, are so wrong from our perspective [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4839.0s)]
*  that, no, here we have laws that say you can't do that. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4845.28s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4848.2s)]
*  But does that involve eating, but the boundary line is pizza and rice and what you eat with [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4849.92s)]
*  your hands? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4855.32s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4856.32s)]
*  And they try to make it seem like the foreigners are all terrible and dirty and they defecate [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4857.32s)]
*  in the streets. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4864.44s)]
*  And they're all the same way and we gotta keep them all out. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4865.44s)]
*  I know, but doesn't Ron DeSantis like to eat chocolate pudding with his hands? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4868.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but that's why we're sending him back. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4872.16s)]
*  Where? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4874.96s)]
*  Where are we gonna send him? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4875.96s)]
*  I don't know where we're sending him back. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4876.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4879.08s)]
*  Okay, I gotta show you one more video though. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4880.08s)]
*  So we read a tweet or a post on X from Congressman Brandon Gill. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4881.759999999999s)]
*  Well you're about to hear him and Will Kane talk about this very important matter in the [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4886.48s)]
*  next clip. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4891.639999999999s)]
*  Pizza, burgers, hot dogs, eat with their fingers. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4895.639999999999s)]
*  But I don't think you can separate Mom Donnie's performance and what he's saying from the [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4900.5599999999995s)]
*  way he is projecting himself eating rice with his fingers. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4905.5199999999995s)]
*  He is rejecting what we have developed as Western civilization. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4909.12s)]
*  And he puts these videos out online of him eating rice with his hands, which by the way [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4912.5199999999995s)]
*  is not something that Americans do. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4917.2s)]
*  That is third world behavior. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4920.04s)]
*  And that is connected to his policies. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4922.919999999999s)]
*  The goal here is to undermine Western civilization, to fetishize the third world, which is what [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4925.72s)]
*  he's doing that video, to look other, to look unique, to look interesting, so that he can [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4931.6s)]
*  then push in these policies. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4936.32s)]
*  The next step after that is he's gonna make another video in a couple of years, but instead [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4938.28s)]
*  of having a bowl of rice, it's gonna be an empty bowl, because that's where his policies [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4942.4s)]
*  are gonna get us. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4946.24s)]
*  It's not a rejection of a multicultural society, unless the point of your cultural mores is [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4947.24s)]
*  to openly reject the place in which you have immigrated. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4954.2s)]
*  He's just eating rice with his hands. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4960.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4962.08s)]
*  That's it. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4963.08s)]
*  That's all it is. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4964.08s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4965.08s)]
*  There's nothing more to it than that. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4966.08s)]
*  No, I'll give him one thing that I found to be interesting about that video, not their [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4967.08s)]
*  commentary is that I thought, that's interesting. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4970.72s)]
*  He knows he's being taped and he's doing it anyway. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4974.24s)]
*  I think what he was saying by doing that, cuz he's a super smart guy. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4976.96s)]
*  It's not like he missed what he was doing, right? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4980.4s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4982.8s)]
*  I think that what he was saying is, yeah, I'm not embarrassed of my culture. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4983.8s)]
*  You want me to be embarrassed of my traditions and my heritage, but I refuse. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4988.360000000001s)]
*  I'm not embarrassed by it. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4993.76s)]
*  And I belong here just as much as you do, even if you're not used to folks eating this [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=4995.4400000000005s)]
*  way. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5000.320000000001s)]
*  And I think that's kinda strong. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5001.320000000001s)]
*  And because if he ever gets to a situation where he might be in a position to get power, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5003.24s)]
*  I think he's smart enough to know that this would have happened. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5008.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5011.360000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5012.360000000001s)]
*  So, what's your grain of truth to what you're saying? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5013.599999999999s)]
*  I got it, I got the right reference. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5015.24s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you the one thing I'm surprised they're not going after. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5017.28s)]
*  But first also, I can't let this one slide either. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5022.4s)]
*  Charlie Kirk with the Mohammedism. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5025.719999999999s)]
*  What is that? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5029.44s)]
*  Why do you just say Islam, right? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5030.44s)]
*  It reminds me of the old school, like the clan. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5032.719999999999s)]
*  They'd call them Mohammedans. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5034.96s)]
*  Okay, we're going old school, right? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5036.96s)]
*  I always thought, I'm not like, and Muslim men. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5040.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5043.280000000001s)]
*  Which kinda sounds like Muslim men. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5044.280000000001s)]
*  So you see, I'm not deeply offended by these goofballs, right? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5045.280000000001s)]
*  But it is, if you think Mamdani eating with his fingers is purposeful in whichever direction, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5049.160000000001s)]
*  certainly Charlie Kirk saying Mohammedism- [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5055.84s)]
*  Of course. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5058.88s)]
*  Is also purposeful- [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5059.88s)]
*  Of course. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5060.88s)]
*  To make it seem like, so weird and scary and dangerous, the Mohammedism. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5061.88s)]
*  He wants free love rights. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5066.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5068.84s)]
*  Whatever, I'd like- [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5069.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5070.84s)]
*  Keep doing you booze, cuz I am entertained. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5071.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5074.400000000001s)]
*  And I need to laugh, so that's great. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5075.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and so the thing that I'm surprised they're not going after is something that's [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5076.400000000001s)]
*  a little bit true, which is way too many rings. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5081.400000000001s)]
*  I didn't even notice. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5084.52s)]
*  Okay, so- [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5086.52s)]
*  I know, Cenk, but- [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5087.52s)]
*  Okay, I'm kidding around. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5088.52s)]
*  You're a bit of a grandpa. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5089.52s)]
*  Exactly, right? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5091.52s)]
*  So for me, I'm unk, right? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5092.52s)]
*  I'm old school, so I'm not gonna wear eight different rings, right? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5095.6s)]
*  But he's from the new school, and they wear a lot of rings. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5099.96s)]
*  They do wear a lot of rings. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5102.5199999999995s)]
*  So who cares, wear 12 rings, what do I care, right? [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5103.5199999999995s)]
*  Seems like you care a little bit at least. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5106.839999999999s)]
*  No, but my point is that I'm surprised they didn't pick up on it yet. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5108.24s)]
*  That's gonna be round two. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5111.639999999999s)]
*  They're like, what is going on with these rings? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5112.639999999999s)]
*  They're trying to do, I don't know, fill in the blank, right? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5114.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, I will say this. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5117.879999999999s)]
*  It is unusual to eat rice with your hands, right? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5121.92s)]
*  And we don't do that in America, but some cultures do. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5124.2s)]
*  And among the various cultural traditions that various cultures have in this country, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5127.88s)]
*  that is the least offensive to me, right? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5134.72s)]
*  Cuz I don't care, no one's forcing me to eat with my hands. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5136.92s)]
*  Who cares? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5140.88s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5141.88s)]
*  It's Obama's tan suit, literally. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5142.88s)]
*  It's the same type of nonsense. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5146.32s)]
*  And when you make a big deal out of it, you betray yourself, right? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5148.34s)]
*  Because everybody knows it's not a big deal. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5152.18s)]
*  And so when you pretend that it is, what you're trying to do is go, ha ha foreigner. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5154.0s)]
*  And everybody knows it. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5160.64s)]
*  Totally. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5161.64s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5162.64s)]
*  When we come back, we've got more stories for you, including, well, Kristi Noem with [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5164.04s)]
*  a fascinating allegation that's unfounded. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5171.28s)]
*  So we'll tell you what that is and more when we come back. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5173.96s)]
*  All right, back on TYT. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5206.68s)]
*  Let's go to Super Chat. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5220.240000000001s)]
*  In Guns We Trust wrote in, hands were designed biologically for us to eat and grasp things [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5221.240000000001s)]
*  with and arms are this length so we can reach our mouths, unlike T-Rex dinosaurs. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5226.240000000001s)]
*  They're mad at him for using the tools God gave us. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5233.72s)]
*  Now, I would argue evolution gave us for logical reasons, but exactly, right? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5236.76s)]
*  We weren't supposed to eat with our toes or our eyelashes. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5242.68s)]
*  We were in the beginning supposed to eat with our hands. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5247.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5250.320000000001s)]
*  Spicy Trans Cupcake writes in, what does Charlie Kirk think about eating pudding with your [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5251.320000000001s)]
*  fingers? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5255.280000000001s)]
*  So that's the point that Anna made and no 7075 Jim and others also made it too. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5256.3s)]
*  And you guys are of course absolutely right. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5262.44s)]
*  I can't remember if DeSantis actually ate pudding with his fingers or if it was just [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5264.64s)]
*  like a- [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5269.44s)]
*  No, no, it was actual. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5270.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5271.44s)]
*  So JD Vance never had sex with his couch that was made up. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5272.44s)]
*  But DeSantis did eat it with his fingers. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5277.5199999999995s)]
*  Why is DeSantis rejecting Western culture? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5280.5599999999995s)]
*  And like- [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5284.36s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5285.36s)]
*  Because it's not a cultural thing for DeSantis. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5286.5s)]
*  That's why it's weirder. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5289.16s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5290.16s)]
*  It's not like Italians in Florida are like, yeah, pudding. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5292.56s)]
*  I've never seen that, right? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5296.04s)]
*  Maybe they go like, give me some moots with that and they use a fork and a spoon to- [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5298.16s)]
*  That's fun. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5305.84s)]
*  That's fun. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5306.84s)]
*  I can't wait for Charlie Kirk and the others to be like, who uses a spoon and a fork? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5307.84s)]
*  They're swirled in spaghetti. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5311.6s)]
*  That's outrageous. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5313.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5314.4400000000005s)]
*  Anyways, Titan Risen, will mainstream media ever wake up? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5315.4400000000005s)]
*  Alex Thompson was so defensive when you guys called out mainstream media in that interview. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5318.24s)]
*  He was all like, I'm mainstreaming it. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5321.8s)]
*  I disagree with you. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5326.16s)]
*  I think Cenk was very hostile for no reason. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5327.16s)]
*  No, I was hostile, but for very good reason. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5329.12s)]
*  And so- [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5332.28s)]
*  But he's like one of the guys who actually did the right thing. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5333.28s)]
*  Yeah, but no, I'll tell you why I did that. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5335.6s)]
*  It's a good conversation. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5338.16s)]
*  So real quick, guys, I almost want him to be a messenger and take him back to the other [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5339.6s)]
*  mainstream media people, right? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5345.26s)]
*  Because other guys won't even come on, like Jay Tapper obviously didn't come on because [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5347.16s)]
*  he's afraid of us, right? [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5350.3s)]
*  And he's worried, etc, etc. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5352.5599999999995s)]
*  So I, and I texted with him afterwards with Alex Thompson, because what I want him to [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5354.5199999999995s)]
*  understand is we're all in our different bubbles and we don't understand each other at all. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5359.44s)]
*  So those mainstream media guys, they think they're nailing it. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5363.92s)]
*  They think that they're nearly perfect. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5368.12s)]
*  So when we do our critique of them, they're bewildered by it. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5370.92s)]
*  And you think, no way. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5375.48s)]
*  And I try to explain to Alex, a lot of people on the left and right think that mainstream [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5376.96s)]
*  media guys are evil. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5381.96s)]
*  And they gotta know that they're manipulating people and telling people that politicians [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5383.44s)]
*  are honest and the money doesn't affect them and all this garbage that they say, right? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5387.72s)]
*  And I try to explain to you guys, no, they're not evil. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5393.46s)]
*  They genuinely believe that the money doesn't affect the politicians. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5396.12s)]
*  It's not relevant in legislation, etc. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5400.6s)]
*  And I know you think they can't possibly believe that. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5402.86s)]
*  No, the bubbles are super thick. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5405.5199999999995s)]
*  They do believe that. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5408.24s)]
*  That's why I'm trying to send a messenger back and tell them, guys, folks over here [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5410.16s)]
*  think you're evil. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5415.5199999999995s)]
*  Because it's so obvious that you're not saying things that are true. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5417.5599999999995s)]
*  Anyway. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5420.96s)]
*  Bread pudding. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5422.96s)]
*  Bloody love bread pudding. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5423.96s)]
*  Can smell it. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5425.6s)]
*  You know, I thought I could go all fantastic Mr. Fox on that. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5426.6s)]
*  All right, back on the TIT, checking in with you guys and Annette Adams as well. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5452.84s)]
*  Annette, you're awesome for hitting that big beautiful button below the video on YouTube. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5456.76s)]
*  TYT.COM slash join a couple months off of annual membership. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5460.68s)]
*  All right, Casper. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5463.64s)]
*  Things are popping off over at the Joe Rogan experience. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5465.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what you think of the new administration. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5468.0s)]
*  Certainly, there are things that I like about and some of their pro tech posture and things [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5472.36s)]
*  like that. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5478.66s)]
*  What's happening now is kind of disappointing. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5479.66s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5482.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5483.58s)]
*  We were told there would be no, well, there's two things that are insane. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5484.58s)]
*  Joe Rogan had some pretty harsh words for the Trump administration on the latest episode [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5490.0599999999995s)]
*  of the Joe Rogan experience, which was just released. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5496.18s)]
*  Now, you just heard him say that he had two things happening in the Trump administration [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5498.9s)]
*  that he finds insane. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5505.16s)]
*  Well, he got through one of them and then the conversation went off in a different direction [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5506.76s)]
*  before he could say the other. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5513.12s)]
*  But here's the one that he didn't get to, or did get to. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5514.84s)]
*  One is the targeting of migrant workers, not cartel members, not gang members, not drug [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5519.08s)]
*  dealers, just construction workers showing up in construction sites and raiding them. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5528.2s)]
*  Gardeners. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5534.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5535.540000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5536.540000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's absolutely right about that. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5537.540000000001s)]
*  In fact, if you look at the breakdown of the numbers of various people who have been detained [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5541.42s)]
*  by ICE, especially in recent months, the majority of them have not committed any crime. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5547.46s)]
*  They've never been convicted of any crime. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5552.900000000001s)]
*  They might be in the country and they're undocumented. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5555.46s)]
*  But the way that the Trump administration talks about these people makes it appear as [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5558.06s)]
*  though they've committed all sorts of violent, dangerous crimes. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5562.700000000001s)]
*  And that's just not the case. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5565.42s)]
*  So look, I think this is an important story for a couple of reasons. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5567.0s)]
*  Number one, this is the second time that Rogan has said the same thing, right? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5569.88s)]
*  And what a lot of us don't realize, because we all live in different bubbles, is that [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5573.52s)]
*  these independent shows, what sometimes people are calling the bro shows, I'm gonna try to [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5579.64s)]
*  call them independent podcasters from now on or broadcasters. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5584.24s)]
*  And so that independent media, the left was told that they're all right wing, Trump loving [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5587.4s)]
*  cultists. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5593.12s)]
*  And the right probably thinks that they're exactly in the middle or something along those [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5595.42s)]
*  lines and have annoying left wing opinions and stuff. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5598.62s)]
*  So yeah, as news people, our job is to relay to you what's actually happening in the world, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5601.18s)]
*  right? [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5605.82s)]
*  And the reality is that most of those shows lean anywhere from a little right to a lot [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5606.82s)]
*  right, right? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5612.14s)]
*  Some of them lean a little left, but not a lot, right? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5614.08s)]
*  So Andrew Schultz is, for example, voted for Trump, but is a lifelong Democrat. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5618.04s)]
*  If you count Charlemagne and Breakfast Club, he's clearly a Democrat, right? [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5623.080000000001s)]
*  But Rogan, Thiovon, etc., while they might have supported Trump, but you all know that [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5627.38s)]
*  Rogan supported Bernie earlier. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5631.76s)]
*  What they're really supporting guys is outsiders and populists. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5633.76s)]
*  So you can say, no, I don't like that, or you can say I love that, but that is what's [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5638.360000000001s)]
*  happening. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5643.4400000000005s)]
*  And so that is why Rogan does disagree with Trump plenty of times. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5644.4400000000005s)]
*  So if you watch his show, you'll see things like this, and that's why this is the second [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5648.34s)]
*  time he said it. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5651.68s)]
*  The second reason why it's important is because those guys got to be successful by tapping [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5653.22s)]
*  into something that a lot of Americans agree with, right? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5658.32s)]
*  And what they're doing is they're saying, and Rogan has clarified this on this issue, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5662.82s)]
*  so look, I think what people voted for was close off the border and take out the criminals [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5666.82s)]
*  that are undocumented. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5673.5s)]
*  That's gonna make you really popular, right? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5674.5s)]
*  So I think most of us agree with that. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5677.62s)]
*  Maybe some folks on the left don't agree with that. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5679.58s)]
*  But overall, yeah, that makes sense. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5681.92s)]
*  And if you're in that position and you don't like it, but the majority of the country definitely [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5684.22s)]
*  agrees with that. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5688.34s)]
*  But he says if you go in and start taking out construction workers and guys who are [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5689.9400000000005s)]
*  working in restaurants, etc., he's like, nobody's gonna like that. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5694.88s)]
*  And he's right. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5699.14s)]
*  And Napoleon indicates that people don't like that, right? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5700.14s)]
*  So now I say that to the right-wing guys, cuz the right-wing guys think, no, everybody [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5703.78s)]
*  thinks like I do. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5707.78s)]
*  So like- [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5709.12s)]
*  No, they don't. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5710.12s)]
*  Yeah, and they think, my God, I love alligator Alcatraz. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5711.12s)]
*  I love snatching up these undocumented wherever they live, right in front of their kids. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5713.96s)]
*  I love that. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5720.0s)]
*  The country loves it. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5721.0s)]
*  No, the country doesn't love it. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5722.0s)]
*  Rogan is right. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5723.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5724.599999999999s)]
*  No, by the way, you just touched on something, because this whole immigration debate is so [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5725.599999999999s)]
*  frustrating because this is what's gonna happen. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5732.2s)]
*  I can already see it, okay? [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5735.759999999999s)]
*  The pendulum is just gonna keep swinging from one extreme to another, right? [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5737.06s)]
*  Democrat comes in, promises they're gonna let things get out of control at the border, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5741.14s)]
*  just like Biden did, okay? [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5745.4s)]
*  That leads to some unsavory people getting in the country and doing bad things. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5747.46s)]
*  Obviously, a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, minuscule portion of people who are [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5752.34s)]
*  in the country, illegally, okay? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5757.66s)]
*  And rather than address that as Democrats, rather than ensuring that you have a proposal, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5760.98s)]
*  a plan to do something about those folks, they decide to create a vacuum in which Republicans [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5766.98s)]
*  and people like Trump come in and say, I'm gonna be the one who protects you, right? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5773.639999999999s)]
*  They're gonna focus on the very specific instances of terrible crimes being committed, and people [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5778.04s)]
*  are going to support them. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5783.5199999999995s)]
*  But then Trump comes in and he starts targeting people who should not be targeted. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5785.32s)]
*  I'm sorry, you shouldn't be going after day laborers at Home Depot parking lots. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5791.32s)]
*  You shouldn't be going after construction workers. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5795.26s)]
*  You shouldn't be going after women who work at these hotels to do upkeep and all. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5797.46s)]
*  People don't like it, right? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5803.7s)]
*  People thought that Trump's gonna come in and he's going to prioritize people who are [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5805.26s)]
*  actually a danger to society. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5808.9400000000005s)]
*  But that is not what he did, because that's actually a lot harder to do. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5810.7s)]
*  And there aren't a lot of people to mass deport that fall in that category. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5814.0s)]
*  So we're in one right-wing extreme right now. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5818.02s)]
*  The next will be a left-wing extreme, and the pendulum goes back and forth, back and [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5820.68s)]
*  forth. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5824.54s)]
*  We can't have, God forbid, any common sense immigration policies. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5825.54s)]
*  We can't reform immigration. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5828.7s)]
*  We can't have a pathway to citizenship for people who have been in this country for literally [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5830.34s)]
*  decades. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5833.82s)]
*  We're just gonna keep moving back and forth from one failed policy to another. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5835.22s)]
*  Yeah, look, there's another reason why these shows are important in them saying this. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5839.98s)]
*  First, last thought on the immigration point is, look, this is exactly what we said on [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5844.58s)]
*  day one. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5848.62s)]
*  Why? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5849.62s)]
*  Because it's not only is it bad politics for Trump in the right way. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5850.62s)]
*  You could drive down your poll numbers, but it's cruel. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5853.82s)]
*  It's cruel. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5857.34s)]
*  And American people don't like cruelty. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5858.34s)]
*  I don't like cruelty. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5859.7s)]
*  None of us here do, right? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5860.94s)]
*  And so ripping people up from a life they've lived for the last 10 years, 15 years, when [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5862.58s)]
*  they're trying to provide for their family, etc. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5867.82s)]
*  The American people are just not as cruel as the radical right is. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5870.62s)]
*  They're not. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5873.66s)]
*  Okay, and I know because in their bubble, they just can't get that. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5874.66s)]
*  But the other important thing outside of immigration as to why these shows are so important is [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5878.0599999999995s)]
*  because they truly are independent. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5883.54s)]
*  So they can get audience captured. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5887.4s)]
*  I think Rogan for a while got guests captured, right? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5889.18s)]
*  And so those are all things you gotta look out for, sponsor capture, all that stuff is [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5893.54s)]
*  legitimate, and there's algorithmic incentives, etc. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5897.3s)]
*  We gotta look out for all that. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5903.1s)]
*  But having said that, it's so much better than the terrible old days where the entire [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5904.16s)]
*  right wing got their information from Fox News. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5909.76s)]
*  And Fox News is a corporate driven entity. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5912.44s)]
*  And all they do is talking points. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5915.839999999999s)]
*  And in the old days when I talked to Republicans, they were all robots, all said the same exact [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5918.599999999999s)]
*  thing as Sean Hannity on every single issue. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5923.4s)]
*  And it was just, it was depressing. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5926.719999999999s)]
*  We lost half the country to like, they'd become zombified. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5928.96s)]
*  So are some of them still zombified? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5933.46s)]
*  Sure, of course, right? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5935.12s)]
*  But a lot of them are now listening to these guys, and Dylan and Rogan and Vaughn and all [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5936.86s)]
*  these guys. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5944.0599999999995s)]
*  And what they're getting is a whole smattering of different opinions, right? [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5945.0599999999995s)]
*  And Dave Smith and some of them are pro-Israel, some of them are anti-Israel. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5948.66s)]
*  A lot of them are really concerned about what Israel's doing, right? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5952.179999999999s)]
*  A lot of them say, hey, you know what, we wanna close the border, but don't do this [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5955.339999999999s)]
*  to immigrants. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5958.9s)]
*  And so even if you disagree with them on a majority of the issues, at least they're not [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5960.179999999999s)]
*  a conveyor belt of corporate talking points. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5966.58s)]
*  100%, I totally agree. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5969.26s)]
*  And that makes a giant difference. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5970.26s)]
*  Or more importantly, partisan talking points. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5972.02s)]
*  Because the media has, it's like bifurcated now, where you're either left-wing media or [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5975.18s)]
*  right-wing media, and then you just cheerlead your tribe no matter what. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5980.14s)]
*  And you're not really getting that with Rogan or Theo Vaughn, and that's a good independent [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5984.1s)]
*  media. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5989.26s)]
*  You're getting less of that, let's just put it that way. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5990.26s)]
*  You're getting way less of that, and you're seeing it every day with your eyes. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5991.66s)]
*  So we did have a poll question for our audience related to this story. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5995.24s)]
*  The question is, what's the most insane part of the Trump administration so far? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=5999.74s)]
*  And then we give you four options, deportations, anti-Palestine crackdown, tariffs, or challenging [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6004.5199999999995s)]
*  the courts. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6011.5199999999995s)]
*  And so far, deportations is ahead by a lot, 43%. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6012.8s)]
*  Anti-Palestinian crackdown is at 14%, tariffs is at 17%, and challenging the courts is at [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6018.28s)]
*  26%. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6023.639999999999s)]
*  That's so interesting. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6024.64s)]
*  I think I would vote challenging the courts, cuz that breaks down all rules and law and [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6025.64s)]
*  order, right? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6030.84s)]
*  Then you have no rules to protect you on anything. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6032.08s)]
*  But all are legitimate and all are terrible. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6035.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6037.64s)]
*  And last thing about the independent shows that I think are positive. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6038.64s)]
*  Again, I probably disagree with at least 60% of what somebody like Rogan might say, maybe [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6041.160000000001s)]
*  70, maybe 80, right? [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6047.6s)]
*  But what I love is that this is now, this is totally accidental, just the nature of [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6049.24s)]
*  these shows having different opinions, is that it is forcing people to use independent [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6055.44s)]
*  judgment. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6061.2s)]
*  Yes, yes, that's a good thing. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6062.2s)]
*  Right, instead of just going, okay, this is my right-wing ideology, this is my left-wing [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6063.48s)]
*  ideology, I'm never going to veer from it. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6067.0s)]
*  Fox News told me never to veer from this, MSNBC told me to never veer from this, right? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6069.12s)]
*  Now even if you like the independent shows, well, sometimes Andrew Schultz disagrees with [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6074.36s)]
*  Joe Rogan. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6079.12s)]
*  So what are we gonna do? [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6081.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6082.16s)]
*  We gotta pick one, right? [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6083.16s)]
*  And so when you expand out even to the right-wing shows, Mark Levin and Tucker Crossland, they [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6084.16s)]
*  obviously disagree. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6088.2s)]
*  So now you gotta use your mind. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6089.5199999999995s)]
*  Which one am I gonna go with? [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6091.28s)]
*  Wait, I'm gonna listen to their arguments. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6092.28s)]
*  And we're at the beginning of people using their own minds. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6094.28s)]
*  And then what it does is it also makes them research things. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6097.96s)]
*  I wonder who's right. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6100.799999999999s)]
*  That's for laxpers. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6102.28s)]
*  You're being a little too optimistic. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6103.28s)]
*  No, no, I'm not. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6104.28s)]
*  No, guys, this is the beginning of that. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6105.28s)]
*  And so it's not like I think it's over, everybody's independent thinker now in America. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6108.16s)]
*  We solved it, the country's saved. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6112.679999999999s)]
*  But the fact that it's headed in that direction, to me, is a great step forward. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6114.8s)]
*  All right, we're gonna see for now. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6119.679999999999s)]
*  We're gonna take a quick break. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6122.759999999999s)]
*  And when we come back, we'll talk a little bit about what Kristi Noem is saying about [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6123.759999999999s)]
*  some of the individuals who have been detained and more. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6127.42s)]
*  Don't miss it. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6129.96s)]
*  Is that why Israel moves Palestinians? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6159.96s)]
*  Just saying. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6164.68s)]
*  So two quick things I wanna mention about that. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6165.68s)]
*  I was just on the show yesterday, I told you guys about counterpoints. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6167.68s)]
*  And we should put it up on tyt.com slash press. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6170.4800000000005s)]
*  And the guy was an Israeli supporter that I was debating. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6174.8s)]
*  So he had an alternate reality was where Israel is a blooming democracy filled with hearts [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6178.7s)]
*  and rainbows and unicorns for Palestinians and the whole world, right? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6184.88s)]
*  And they would never harm a butterfly in Gaza, but Hamas did everything terrible and they're [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6188.68s)]
*  the victims and etc, right? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6193.84s)]
*  And I said to the audience at some point, look, you've heard two different alternate [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6195.6s)]
*  realities about what's happening in Gaza. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6200.12s)]
*  Easy way to solve it. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6202.8s)]
*  Just go and look up pictures and video of Gaza. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6204.46s)]
*  And then you'll see who's right and who's wrong. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6208.08s)]
*  Because Israelis really make it seem like what's happening in Gaza is totally normal. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6210.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, of course it's normal. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6214.4400000000005s)]
*  You murder all the journalists, the human rights workers, you murder the children, a [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6216.6s)]
*  stadium full of children and women. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6220.320000000001s)]
*  It's normal, normal. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6221.84s)]
*  You guys are just anti-Semites, right? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6222.84s)]
*  Then you look at pictures and videos of Gaza and you go, not normal, not at all normal. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6225.72s)]
*  This is weirdo crazed destruction and slaughter, right? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6232.4400000000005s)]
*  So that's why I like what you're saying. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6238.0s)]
*  Just look up Gaza on Google Earth, you'll see the answer. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6239.200000000001s)]
*  This is Carmichael Wright saying, in the US we eat french fries, barbecue wings and ribs [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6242.68s)]
*  with our hands. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6246.240000000001s)]
*  How is eating rice with your hands more undignified than other things? [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6247.240000000001s)]
*  Sometimes those wings be saucy. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6250.16s)]
*  Yeah, no, the reason I read that is because we already gave plenty of examples, but I [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6251.52s)]
*  felt bad for not including the ones you said. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6254.4400000000005s)]
*  Because of course ribs and wings. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6257.64s)]
*  It's like we got the sauce all over our face and our hands. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6260.200000000001s)]
*  Please, we're very sophisticated. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6263.400000000001s)]
*  You third-worlders are so uncivilized. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6264.400000000001s)]
*  So sophisticated. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6266.400000000001s)]
*  Here, give me another slap of ribs. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6267.400000000001s)]
*  Come on, come on. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6270.88s)]
*  I love how smart our audience is, great point. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6273.6s)]
*  America Needs a Reboot says, what came first, the big beautiful join button or the big beautiful [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6278.280000000001s)]
*  bill? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6282.6s)]
*  So beautiful. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6283.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6284.6s)]
*  Join button. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6285.6s)]
*  Okay, look, there's only one way to find out. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6286.6s)]
*  Hit the join button, I'm kidding. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6289.08s)]
*  We're not gonna argue with you. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6290.08s)]
*  You should hit it. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6291.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6292.08s)]
*  Hit it good, real good. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6293.08s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a controversy that'll live on for the ages. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6294.08s)]
*  Okay, Crafty Kether writes in on Twitch, usually sub with Johnny Pie, but I do love me the [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6298.12s)]
*  old school power panel of Cenk and Anna. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6305.84s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6308.72s)]
*  Johnny Pie, relatively new father, gotta give him a break. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6309.72s)]
*  Dude's tired. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6313.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, Johnny Pie's awesome. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6314.48s)]
*  I love that you sub with him normally. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6317.8s)]
*  All right, Amber Jacko and I says, Cenk, have you ever tried to get on Joe Rogan's [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6319.12s)]
*  show or inviting him on here for an interview? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6322.0s)]
*  I think you could explain things to him and his audience in ways that they aren't used [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6324.64s)]
*  to hearing. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6327.84s)]
*  So good news, so you could check out Joe Rogan on the Young Turks from God, that was a long [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6328.84s)]
*  time ago. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6335.52s)]
*  2014, I think it was. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6336.52s)]
*  Okay, so over a decade ago. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6337.52s)]
*  I was on once, were you on twice? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6338.96s)]
*  I was on twice. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6340.64s)]
*  You guys wanna know a funny story about me going on Rogan? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6341.64s)]
*  He had, I think he had requested me or his producer at the time had requested me to go [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6344.52s)]
*  on the show. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6348.2s)]
*  And I was like too afraid to go on his show because I heard bad things. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6349.2s)]
*  And then I met Christian, who was a huge Rogan fan and I wanted to impress him. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6353.0s)]
*  So I reached back out and I was like, okay, I'll go on. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6357.0s)]
*  My God, that's that old. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6359.6s)]
*  Wow, that's interesting. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6361.6s)]
*  So what happened with Rogan real quick is that he caught feelings because I threatened [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6362.72s)]
*  to fight him. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6367.84s)]
*  It's a big deal, right? [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6368.84s)]
*  And then so he hasn't had me on since. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6370.0s)]
*  But that one I get at least like as opposed to Bill Maher was like, he likes Muslims. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6371.52s)]
*  All right, so you got a message for John Iderol? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6376.0s)]
*  I got to read these two comments because they're too fun. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6380.0s)]
*  I have to. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6404.4s)]
*  Chris, the Nomad says, Cenk has the best impressions. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6405.64s)]
*  I had to read it. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6409.44s)]
*  I had to read it. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6410.44s)]
*  Don't enable him. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6411.44s)]
*  Okay, of course you should. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6412.44s)]
*  And Michael Catalano says, here's Cenk with the old Viking strategy of send one back alive [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6414.0s)]
*  to tell the others, lol. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6418.92s)]
*  That is kind of what I did with Alex Thompson. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6419.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6424.92s)]
*  Stop, please stop. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6425.92s)]
*  All right, Casper. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6426.92s)]
*  All right, let's do it. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6427.92s)]
*  Next story. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6430.92s)]
*  We are going after murderers and rapists and traffickers and drug dealers and getting them [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6431.92s)]
*  off the streets and getting them out of this country because Joe Biden let the worst of [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6438.32s)]
*  the worst come in here. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6442.48s)]
*  The other day I was talking to some marshals that have been partnering with ICE. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6443.48s)]
*  They said that they had detained a cannibal. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6447.04s)]
*  Did they? [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6451.76s)]
*  Did they detain a cannibal? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6452.76s)]
*  Because I know for a fact that what she said about the Trump administration and ICE specifically [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6454.92s)]
*  targeting rapists and criminals and really dangerous people is untrue. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6460.72s)]
*  And I'm going to show you the receipts in just a moment. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6464.96s)]
*  Did they? [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6467.4400000000005s)]
*  Did they detain a cannibal? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6468.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6469.4400000000005s)]
*  Why don't we hear more of what she has to say? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6470.4400000000005s)]
*  President Trump is upholding freedom by what he is doing. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6473.400000000001s)]
*  The freedom to live safely in this country and to do things legally and to have justice. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6476.4400000000005s)]
*  And because those liberals, and I'm calling out you CNN, I'm calling you out because you [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6482.08s)]
*  lie every single day about what these operations are. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6486.6s)]
*  We are going after murderers and rapists and traffickers and drug dealers and getting them [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6489.84s)]
*  off the streets and getting them out of this country because Joe Biden let the worst of [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6495.44s)]
*  the worst come in here. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6499.639999999999s)]
*  The other day I was talking to some marshals that have been partnering with ICE. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6500.639999999999s)]
*  They said that they had detained a cannibal and put him on a plane to take him home. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6504.2s)]
*  And while they had him in his seat, he started to eat himself. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6508.759999999999s)]
*  And they had to get him off and get him medical attention. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6512.12s)]
*  These are the kind of deranged individuals that are on our streets in America that we're [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6514.44s)]
*  trying to target and get out of our country because they are so deranged they don't belong [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6519.5199999999995s)]
*  here. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6524.8s)]
*  He was eating himself, okay. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6525.8s)]
*  That's hell of a feat. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6529.52s)]
*  Okay, how was he eating himself? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6530.52s)]
*  Okay, all right, all right. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6532.52s)]
*  So I don't believe her. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6533.52s)]
*  What I do believe though is that this mad dash to detain and deport as many people as [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6535.58s)]
*  possible because Trump wants to engage in this make believe competition with the deporter [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6543.02s)]
*  in chief Obama is pathetic and innocent people are getting caught up in this as a result. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6551.12s)]
*  So I want to just quickly mention that there was an American citizen in Los Angeles who [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6557.72s)]
*  was detained by ICE and the family is looking for answers. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6562.92s)]
*  This is from CBS News. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6566.0s)]
*  The family members of a US citizen who was taken into custody by federal agents in downtown [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6567.22s)]
*  Los Angeles on Tuesday are demanding answers as she was detained while on her way to work. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6572.2s)]
*  She wasn't part of a protest. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6578.46s)]
*  She wasn't doing anything wrong. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6579.9800000000005s)]
*  Homegirls on her way to work, American citizen, she gets snatched up by ICE. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6581.54s)]
*  Andrea Velez, a Cal Poly Pomona grad working in merchandising at a shoe company had just [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6586.58s)]
*  been dropped off by her mother and sister for the workday when they saw her being taken [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6593.58s)]
*  into custody adding they had barely even driven a block before the arrest began. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6598.74s)]
*  And that's just one example, okay. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6604.9s)]
*  I don't believe anything coming out of this administration when it comes to their detention [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6607.26s)]
*  and deportation of undocumented people. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6613.14s)]
*  Because again, it's so clear to me that everything they're doing is ham handed. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6616.740000000001s)]
*  They don't care about due process. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6621.72s)]
*  They're snatching up all sorts of people who haven't even done anything wrong. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6623.3s)]
*  Yeah, so I want to talk about how this affects businesses in a second too. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6626.22s)]
*  But I mean, look, there's serious and lighthearted stuff here. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6631.46s)]
*  The serious stuff to get that out of the way for a second is when you snatch up Latinos [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6635.34s)]
*  and Latinas or anyone else that are American citizens because you're racist ass thinks [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6641.34s)]
*  they must be undocumented. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6647.26s)]
*  It's impossible for all of the rest of us to not say F you. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6649.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6653.38s)]
*  Okay, so because all these guys, my God, identity politics is so bad and they're trying to put [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6654.38s)]
*  people above white people, etc. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6661.42s)]
*  They get in power, they're like, just grab all the Latinos and we'll figure them out [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6663.34s)]
*  later. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6667.14s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6668.14s)]
*  That's identity politics on steroids. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6670.18s)]
*  On steroids, definitely. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6672.1s)]
*  Right? [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6673.1s)]
*  As bad as it gets. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6674.1s)]
*  I mean, I can't imagine anything worse in terms of identity politics. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6676.18s)]
*  Okay, so and cruelty is kind of the point here. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6679.7s)]
*  And that's why they love bragging about it. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6683.46s)]
*  And think about it, guys. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6685.1s)]
*  Why is Kristi Noem the head of Homeland Security? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6686.4400000000005s)]
*  Because she's attractive. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6689.58s)]
*  Well, that's part of it. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6690.58s)]
*  Honestly. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6692.42s)]
*  Yeah, and she wanted to run for president. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6693.42s)]
*  She's a rising star, blah, blah, blah. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6694.9s)]
*  But also because she shot a dog in a gravel pit. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6697.9800000000005s)]
*  So the message is, that's how mean we are. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6702.0s)]
*  And the radical right loves that. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6705.52s)]
*  They're like, yes, she's willing to shoot innocent dogs and puppies, right? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6707.5s)]
*  I don't know if that's the case. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6713.3s)]
*  So I don't even know if the radical right likes that. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6714.3s)]
*  That's so mental that I'm not even sure the radical right likes that, right? [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6716.14s)]
*  Everyone loves dogs. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6720.06s)]
*  But Stephen Miller? [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6721.46s)]
*  Stephen Miller is subhuman, so I don't know. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6722.46s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, so there's some folks. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6724.700000000001s)]
*  But they picked her, I think not despite that, but partly because of that, to say we have [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6727.46s)]
*  no bounds, okay? [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6734.42s)]
*  And so here she is. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6736.46s)]
*  So now back to the lighter stuff, no bounds also applies to facts and truth and logic [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6737.660000000001s)]
*  and all those things. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6743.160000000001s)]
*  You found an- [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6744.34s)]
*  No, Cenk. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6745.34s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security could not immediately provide corroborating details [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6746.34s)]
*  of any case to match Gnome's story because it was made up. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6750.4s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6754.44s)]
*  It was made up, okay? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6755.44s)]
*  And you know what else is made up? [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6757.16s)]
*  This idea that everyone who's being detained or most people who are being detained and [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6758.36s)]
*  deported are dangerous criminals, okay? [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6761.799999999999s)]
*  So let's go back to the data, which we've shared with you before, but we'll share it [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6765.599999999999s)]
*  again. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6768.799999999999s)]
*  As of June 14th, ICE had booked into detention 204,297 individuals. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6769.799999999999s)]
*  This is since October 1st of 2024, the start of the fiscal year 2025. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6776.38s)]
*  Of those bookings, 65% or 133,687 individuals had no criminal convictions. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6781.84s)]
*  Moreover, more than 93% of ICE bookings were never convicted of any violent offenses. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6790.3s)]
*  About nine in 10 had no convictions for violent or property offenses. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6797.5s)]
*  So look, you might be in the camp of, I don't care if they've committed zero violent crimes. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6802.46s)]
*  They're here, they're undocumented, I want them out. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6809.0s)]
*  I mean, I disagree with you. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6811.5s)]
*  And honestly, if you were to get every single undocumented person out of the country, our [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6812.94s)]
*  country would literally collapse. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6816.9s)]
*  Our economy would collapse, it would be a complete and utter disaster. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6818.58s)]
*  I don't think people are fully aware of what they're asking for if they are in that camp. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6821.299999999999s)]
*  The other thing is, honestly, I do believe that America is the greatest country. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6826.139999999999s)]
*  I love this country. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6830.820000000001s)]
*  And you wanna know what I love about this country? [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6831.900000000001s)]
*  The fact that it's a place where people from all over the world come together and they're [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6833.820000000001s)]
*  proud to be Americans. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6838.5s)]
*  Okay, they're proud to be part of this country. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6840.02s)]
*  That's what makes this country so unique and so great. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6842.46s)]
*  And this obsession with no, what's the racial makeup? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6846.02s)]
*  And we gotta make sure that there's more whites than any other. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6852.1s)]
*  It's so utterly lame. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6854.820000000001s)]
*  Are we Americans? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6856.62s)]
*  Are we ever going to move toward having a shared identity as Americans? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6857.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's called the United States of America, right? [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6862.16s)]
*  So if you wanna just white people, there's actually some countries that are largely white, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6866.5599999999995s)]
*  but that's not America. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6872.04s)]
*  America's always had Latinos, America's always had African Americans, obviously from early, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6873.799999999999s)]
*  well before the formation of the country. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6879.16s)]
*  Technically, actually, we've always had Asians in the country, because we're United States [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6881.28s)]
*  of America, right? [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6885.639999999999s)]
*  And we're the ones who came up with the idea, I mean, roughly speaking, and we were before [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6887.58s)]
*  the French Revolution, of equality. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6891.74s)]
*  That no matter what race or religion you are, you're equal here. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6894.42s)]
*  But that's the beauty of America, that's not the downside of America, that's the upside [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6898.36s)]
*  of America. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6901.7s)]
*  So look back to the crime issue. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6902.86s)]
*  So natural born citizens actually commit crimes at twice the rate of undocumented immigrants. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6905.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay, I gotta- [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6911.26s)]
*  Okay, all right, you're gonna clarify that, okay. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6912.98s)]
*  No, no, that data is skewed and I care a lot about being accurate, okay? [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6915.14s)]
*  We don't know, and the reason why we don't know is because in sanctuary cities and states, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6922.04s)]
*  they literally do not ask about immigration status when someone commits a crime, is convicted [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6927.200000000001s)]
*  of a crime, and spends time in prison. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6932.52s)]
*  So I don't know whether the data took, first of all, those are just cities, okay? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6934.12s)]
*  They have a significant amount of people, but we're talking about 330 million people [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6939.12s)]
*  in the country. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6942.56s)]
*  I don't know if they got classified as natural born citizens, or undocumented, or neither, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6943.580000000001s)]
*  right? [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6948.02s)]
*  And if they're classified as neither, it actually doesn't affect the data that much. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6949.02s)]
*  Do you see what I'm saying? [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6953.620000000001s)]
*  So okay, but either way, so let's say it's not- [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6954.820000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6958.22s)]
*  That more citizens aren't twice as criminal. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6959.22s)]
*  They commit 125% more crime, or 50% more crime, or 25% more crime, or maybe it's even, okay? [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6964.22s)]
*  But there's no data at all saying undocumented immigrants create more crime. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6971.18s)]
*  And again, there's logic to it, because if you're here, you don't wanna get caught, right? [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6977.16s)]
*  And so, okay, my point is, if you demagogued about natural born citizens, look at how absurd [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6981.68s)]
*  it would sound. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6987.4800000000005s)]
*  Natural born citizens, people that were born in America commit more crime. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6989.3s)]
*  We gotta get rid of those criminals and rapists. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6993.280000000001s)]
*  We have to kick them all out and only have naturalized citizens. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6996.04s)]
*  You'd be like, what is this guy, a lunatic? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=6998.6s)]
*  Yes, some small percentage of natural born citizens commit crime, and some small percentage [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7000.92s)]
*  are rapists. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7005.46s)]
*  But we're gonna judge all of them based on that? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7006.46s)]
*  That makes no sense at all. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7008.64s)]
*  This same is true of undocumented immigrants. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7010.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7013.26s)]
*  A very small percentage commit crimes. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7014.26s)]
*  Don't defend those guys. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7016.54s)]
*  Punish them, and then kick them out of the country. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7018.7s)]
*  The rest of them are not like that at all. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7021.12s)]
*  You know why? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7022.9400000000005s)]
*  Cuz they're human, okay? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7023.9400000000005s)]
*  I know, shocking. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7025.7s)]
*  So, look, I mentioned the business interests real quick on that. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7026.7s)]
*  They're busting into these workplaces, right? [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7030.68s)]
*  Restaurants and construction places, etc. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7033.4800000000005s)]
*  And when they're doing that, they're massively disturbing the, first of all, not only good [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7036.860000000001s)]
*  hardworking people that were there, okay? [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7042.0s)]
*  But also the business owners and also the community, right? [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7044.76s)]
*  And it's starting to be a little bit like COVID. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7048.6s)]
*  They're going and shutting down businesses one by one, and then people are afraid to [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7051.280000000001s)]
*  go back into those businesses. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7056.04s)]
*  Yep, yep. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7057.64s)]
*  So they're worried like, hey, I'm an American citizen, but I'm of Mexican heritage, or [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7058.64s)]
*  I'm from El Salvador originally, or my family is, right? [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7062.700000000001s)]
*  That's right, yeah. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7065.8s)]
*  So can I go back to that restaurant, or are they gonna pick me up accidentally like they [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7066.8s)]
*  do from time to time, and then not give me rights the next thing you know, I'm deported? [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7069.92s)]
*  So then those businesses are terribly hurt, and it's shutting them down all across the [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7074.160000000001s)]
*  country. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7079.240000000001s)]
*  Okay, but let me just also mention one other thing. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7080.240000000001s)]
*  I think it's fascinating that they're targeting individuals that ICE believes are undocumented. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7081.74s)]
*  There was a lot of tough talk about business owners suffering consequences for employing [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7089.86s)]
*  undocumented people. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7093.58s)]
*  They're not being arrested. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7096.139999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7097.139999999999s)]
*  They're not suffering any consequences. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7098.139999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7099.139999999999s)]
*  In fact, Trump let one guy go. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7100.139999999999s)]
*  He was charged of hiring a lot of immigrants, but he also did massive financial fraud in [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7102.66s)]
*  a 27-year sentence. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7109.139999999999s)]
*  So Trump felt bad for him? [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7111.38s)]
*  Trump's like, there but for the grace of God go I. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7112.38s)]
*  Totally. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7115.06s)]
*  So he just gave him a pardon. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7116.06s)]
*  Like what? [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7117.06s)]
*  Okay, so he's like, and if you remember why Donald Trump hired undocumented immigrants. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7118.06s)]
*  So if you were gonna arrest employers, you'd go and arrest Trump, and he'd be like, law [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7124.32s)]
*  fair, law fair. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7128.62s)]
*  No, no, it's your guys. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7129.62s)]
*  You're the one who hired undocumented immigrants at almost every construction job that you [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7130.62s)]
*  did in New York, at your golf course until just a couple of years ago, right? [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7134.66s)]
*  And so that's why I'm so sorry. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7139.8s)]
*  Okay, last thing, back to fun stuff. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7141.3s)]
*  So Noam says that she saw a man eating himself. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7143.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7147.38s)]
*  Probably saw it on a video online. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7148.38s)]
*  She's like, I don't know where I saw it, YouTube, you porn. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7149.38s)]
*  I don't know, okay? [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7151.860000000001s)]
*  Just said man eating himself. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7152.860000000001s)]
*  I checked it out. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7154.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7155.46s)]
*  So anyway, so but remember, and this goes to please get out of your bubbles, right? [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7156.46s)]
*  So remember another politician had an interesting story about cannibals. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7161.360000000001s)]
*  Let's show you. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7165.58s)]
*  Are you calling these guys bad? [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7168.86s)]
*  And my uncle, they call them Ambrosia, they call them Bozie. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7169.86s)]
*  My uncle Bozie was a hell of an athlete. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7170.86s)]
*  They'd tell me when he was a kid. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7171.86s)]
*  And he became an Army Air Corps before the Air Force came along. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7172.86s)]
*  He flew those single engine planes as reconnaissance over war zones. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7173.86s)]
*  He got shot down in New Guinea. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7174.86s)]
*  And they never found the body because there used to be a lot of cannibals for real. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7175.86s)]
*  And he was shot down in New Guinea. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7176.86s)]
*  And they never found the body because there used to be a lot of cannibals for real. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7177.86s)]
*  And he was shot down in New Guinea. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7178.86s)]
*  And he was shot down in New Guinea. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7179.86s)]
*  And he was shot down in New Guinea. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7180.86s)]
*  And he was shot down in New Guinea. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7181.86s)]
*  And he was shot down in New Guinea. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7182.86s)]
*  And he was shot down in New Guinea. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7183.86s)]
*  So Biden thought his uncle was eaten by cannibals. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6Xx-0DGV0&t=7184.86s)]
