"President Trump floated a new plan on Monday for the $3 billion he wants to strip from Harvard University, saying in a social media post that he was thinking about using the money to fund vocational schools.
‚ÄúI am considering taking THREE BILLION DOLLARS of Grant Money away from a very antisemitic Harvard, and giving it to TRADE SCHOOLS all across our land,‚Äù Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform."

# Trump Is Doing Whatever He Can To SCREW OVER Harvard
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY)
*  Billions of dollars has been paid to Harvard. How ridiculous is that billions? And they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=0.0s)]
*  have $52 billion as an endowment. They have $52 billion. And this country is paying billions [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=6.4s)]
*  and billions of dollars and then give student loans and they have to pay back the loans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=13.76s)]
*  So Harvard's gonna have to change its ways. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=17.96s)]
*  President Donald Trump, who's still at war with Harvard, is now threatening to redirect [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=23.12s)]
*  its federal grants to trade schools instead. Now writing on Truth Social, the president said, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  I am considering taking $3 billion of grant money away from a very anti-Semitic Harvard [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=34.8s)]
*  and giving it to trade schools all across our land. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=42.08s)]
*  Now, of course, he didn't provide any details on how he would do this. What are the details of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=46.32s)]
*  which trade schools would get this money? What's his real reasoning and rationale for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=53.04s)]
*  cutting these federal grants toward Harvard? He did make a good point in that video we just [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=58.72s)]
*  showed you in regard to the billions of dollars Harvard, a private institution, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  receives from the federal government, usually in order to carry out research and stuff like that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=68.48s)]
*  But at the same time, tuition is very high at Harvard and they do accept a lot of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=73.2s)]
*  foreign students. They argue they do that because they want viewpoint diversity. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=79.68s)]
*  I argue that they do that because they get to charge foreign students a lot more in tuition. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=84.72000000000001s)]
*  In fact, the percentage of foreign students that have been accepted to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=89.36000000000001s)]
*  American universities across the board have really increased in recent decades because it's a huge [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=93.12s)]
*  cash cow for them. And sure, I'm willing to believe that they want to accept some foreign [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=98.72s)]
*  born students in order to have viewpoint diversity. But I think the financial reasoning is the main [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  reason. But on that front, Cenk, Donald Trump has banned basically the acceptance of foreign [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=108.88s)]
*  students across the board in American institutions. They want to essentially vet these students and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=116.96s)]
*  their social media before accepting them into the country. I'm sure that that's gonna be [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  challenged in the courts. A federal judge has already blocked what Trump tried to do [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=129.12s)]
*  in banning Harvard in admitting foreign born students. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  But it does seem like he's not gonna give up on specifically targeting Harvard and Harvard [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=137.6s)]
*  will continue with its lawsuits against the Trump administration. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=143.36s)]
*  Yeah, I've never rooted for Harvard so much in my life. I've never rooted for Harvard at all [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=146.16s)]
*  before and now I'm team Harvard because of this situation. So all right, first of all, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=151.68s)]
*  the idea that Harvard is very anti-Semitic is hilarious. It's the funniest thing I've ever [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=158.32s)]
*  heard. Based on what? Because they allowed a protest on their campus, which is exactly [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=163.68s)]
*  what you're supposed to do in college. But it was against beloved Israel, of course, of course. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  That has nothing to do with anti-Semitism. It's not that some college campus protests [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  didn't do anything wrong. They always like the pro-Israel side says, no, I found three instances [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=183.12s)]
*  on college campuses where they bullied or intimidated a Jewish student. Well, I hate that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=189.68s)]
*  and I hope that that never happens, etc. So I can't say that it's never happened. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  I can't say that I'm not concerned about anti-Semitism on a college campus or anywhere. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=200.48s)]
*  Because does anti-Semitism exists in the world? Of course it does, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=206.16s)]
*  But is it such an epidemic swarming Harvard? Where Harvard, they're all just all the students [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  are about to put on clan robes and hoods and go after the Jews. That's how they make it look like. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=219.36s)]
*  No, that's not at all what's happening. And that's not why they're taking this action. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=225.52s)]
*  No, they're taking this action because they got paid by the Israeli lobby [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=230.08s)]
*  to make sure that no one criticizes Israel. Now that's the reality of it. But if you say that, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  they go, well, that's also anti-Semitic. You can't say things that are true, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  like AIPAC was the number one donor to congressional members in this election cycle by a lot. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  $126 million just going directly to the congress people, let alone the dark money, etc. So [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=251.68s)]
*  apparently $126 million doesn't affect politicians at all. That is the only reason why this is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=259.12s)]
*  happening. By the way, Jews in America didn't ask for the anti-Semitism task force. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=264.0s)]
*  The Jewish senators have written a letter to Trump saying, we don't want it and we don't want [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=268.56s)]
*  you to attack Harvard like this. So it's not that Jewish Americans have asked for it. It's that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=274.56s)]
*  Israel has asked for it. And Israel gets whatever it wants here in America, whether you have a [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=280.0s)]
*  Democratic or Republican president. I know you're not allowed to say that, even though it is [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=285.28s)]
*  obviously, obviously true, okay? And that's why Joe Biden gave a blank check to Israel to fund [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=289.2s)]
*  their genocide. That's what Donald Trump is doing likewise. That's why he's doing this crackdown. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  So now if you watch other shows and they don't talk about why this is happening, which includes, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=302.08s)]
*  I believe, literally 100% of mainstream media, they're lying to you about the cause. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=309.44s)]
*  They're helping Israel with their propaganda of pretending that they're concerned about [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  anti-Semitism. As by the way, if they were, there's three people who are driving anti-Semitism in this [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=321.2s)]
*  world more than anyone I have ever seen in my lifetime. Their names are Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=326.0s)]
*  Ben Gavir, and Smotrich, okay? So those three are driving anti-Semitism through the roof, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=330.88s)]
*  through the roof, all across the globe. Not some peace protesters at Harvard. I mean, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=336.72s)]
*  who are you joking with? And then he's gonna send them money to trade schools instead. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=343.68s)]
*  Yeah, my ass he is. He isn't gonna send any trade schools. That's just some populist, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=349.52s)]
*  fake populist talk as always from Donald Trump. And I see, of course, they're very concerned [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  about any kind of bigotry. Because you know how inclusive the Trump administration wants to be, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=360.08s)]
*  and how they're so worried about racism and bigotry, right? They're showing that in all [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=365.44s)]
*  directions otherwise, right? And my God, the degree to which they are concerned about Islamophobia, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=370.16s)]
*  which is obviously 10,000 times worse than anti-Semitism in this country. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  Am I sorry? Am I allowed to say that? No, I know I'm not allowed to say anything. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  I have to say the only thing we should care about is anti-Semitism. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=383.92s)]
*  Screw the Muslims, screw everyone else. Who cares? They're not gonna get a task force. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  They're not gonna get congressional hearings. Nobody's shutting down Harvard over protecting [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  Muslims. Nobody cares about protecting Muslims. Okay, but we're supposed to believe that Donald [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=396.0s)]
*  Trump all of a sudden grew a soft spot in his heart for Jews and only Jews. And it's not the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=400.88s)]
*  money he took from Israeli interests, a foreign government. But all of a sudden, he loves Jews in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=405.36s)]
*  America. And he's really worried. In fact, he's thinking of doing DEI for Jews. Okay, no, none of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=410.0s)]
*  that is true. None of it is remotely true. It doesn't have anything to do with Jewish Americans. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=415.6s)]
*  It has everything to do with a foreign government that has purchased almost all of our politicians. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=419.2s)]
*  I think you're right about that. Certainly, Israel has quite a bit of influence on our [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=423.52s)]
*  politicians. And Donald Trump is even more transactional than most American politicians, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=428.96s)]
*  brazenly so, overtly so. He does as he's paid to do. But I think there's also another wrinkle [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=435.84s)]
*  to the story or another factor that we should consider. Because clearly, Christopher Ruffo [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=442.56s)]
*  has had quite a bit of influence on the Trump administration's behavior or activity in response [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=447.6s)]
*  to university campuses having curriculum that they don't like, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  So Christopher Ruffo is the guy who was very active in the state of Florida, just as Ron [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  DeSantis was engaging in this assault on universities and college campuses that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=465.04s)]
*  had curriculum that he didn't like. And so that same treatment is kind of now being expanded to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=471.12s)]
*  other universities, specifically IVs at the moment. And Harvard has become a real target [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=478.48s)]
*  for Donald Trump because of the fact that Harvard is one of the institutions that's willing to fight [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=483.76s)]
*  back. They filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. They're fighting against the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=489.12s)]
*  Trump administration in regard to the ban on foreign students. And I want to just add one [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=493.36s)]
*  other detail that was reported today. So he claims he's going to redirect $3 billion in [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=498.56s)]
*  Harvard's federal grants to trade schools. But today he actually took even more specific action. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  So Trump asked several federal agencies to look into canceling $100 million in outstanding [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=510.88s)]
*  contracts with Harvard. And so before he made that announcement, and he says that he wants to, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=518.64s)]
*  in addition to canceling these contracts, just do more vetting of foreign-born students who get [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=526.64s)]
*  visas here in this country. Before he announced all of that, the head of Harvard had a sit-down [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=532.72s)]
*  interview with NPR. And during that interview, he kind of talked a little bit about some of the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=539.12s)]
*  allegations against Harvard and how its curriculum doesn't really represent diverse viewpoints. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=543.68s)]
*  So get a load of what Harvard president Alan Garber has to say about some of the critique [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=550.72s)]
*  coming from the Trump administration. The federal government is saying that we need to address [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=555.52s)]
*  anti-Semitism in particular, but it has raised other issues, including issues about speech. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=563.84s)]
*  And it includes claims that we lack viewpoint diversity. There are also claims about [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=570.56s)]
*  failure to comply with laws concerning discrimination more generally. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=578.48s)]
*  For some of this, we have been very clear that we think we do have issues, and I would particularly [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=583.28s)]
*  emphasize the speech issues. We think it's a real problem if, particularly at research universities, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=588.56s)]
*  students don't feel free to speak their minds when faculty feel that they have to think twice [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=596.56s)]
*  before they talk about the subjects that they're teaching. That's a real problem that we need to [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=604.0s)]
*  address. So I actually really do commend Alan Garber for what he said there, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=608.48s)]
*  because I do think that that's been a bit of a problem on university campuses across the country. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=615.04s)]
*  At Harvard specifically, there was one professor, I don't believe he's there anymore, but his name [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=620.48s)]
*  is Roland Friar. And he wanted to look into discrimination in policing, and he started [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  his research with the hypothesis that discrimination absolutely exists with policing. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=631.84s)]
*  And so he was expecting the data to show that unarmed black Americans are more likely to be [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=639.36s)]
*  roughed up and shot by police. But through his research, he found out that while harassment [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=647.44s)]
*  of black Americans is certainly more common when it comes to policing, the shooting of unarmed [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  black people is not disproportionately higher than that of the shootings involving unarmed [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=661.44s)]
*  whites or unarmed individuals of other backgrounds. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=668.6400000000001s)]
*  That research was what it was, and he got a lot of backlash from Harvard as a result of it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=672.6400000000001s)]
*  And yeah, so that kind of stuff does exist. I think that it's a problem [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=678.24s)]
*  when people engage in backlash, when they see data that they don't like or they don't agree with. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=683.6800000000001s)]
*  So the fact that the university's president is drawing attention to that and saying we need to [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=689.2s)]
*  do better is a good thing. But to your point, Cenk, I definitely agree with you. I don't think this is [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=693.52s)]
*  really about anti-Semitism. I don't think Trump is sitting around worried about viewpoint diversity [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=699.44s)]
*  on college campuses. I think he's retaliating against Harvard. He's doing it aggressively. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=705.44s)]
*  I think there are other influences that are motivating his backlash toward Harvard. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=710.0s)]
*  And Harvard's fighting back, and he doesn't like that. He doesn't like that Harvard isn't [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=714.88s)]
*  just doing what he wants them to do. For instance, one of the things that Trump wanted, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=718.72s)]
*  he requested or the government requested the university's disciplinary records on foreign [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=723.6s)]
*  students. So students who are there with foreign visas, as well as video images of student [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=730.24s)]
*  demonstrations, requests that were part of a far reaching list of demands with which Harvard has [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=735.76s)]
*  only partially complied. And so since Harvard isn't just complying with anything that Trump wants, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=741.84s)]
*  he continues targeting them and continues threatening them with more and more [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=748.48s)]
*  grant cancellations and cuts to federal funding. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=752.96s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, I just looked it up because now, just to prove the point, this doesn't have [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=755.6s)]
*  to do with anti-Semitism. Alan Garber is also Jewish American, okay? So if it was really [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=763.2800000000001s)]
*  about anti-Semitism, my guess is that he would also be deeply concerned. What is this actually [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=768.4s)]
*  about? It takes away $3 billion, and a lot of that is scientific research, most of it is. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  So they were looking into curative tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, working on all those different [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=779.12s)]
*  kinds of projects. All those are now halted, all the medical research is halted until Israel is [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=785.52s)]
*  satisfied with how we are doing surveillance on their behalf. The part that bothers me the most is, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=790.88s)]
*  okay, I want the student demonstrations, I want all their pictures. Remember, this isn't about, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=797.12s)]
*  oh my God, did someone commit a crime? If someone committed a crime as an assault on a Jewish [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=801.84s)]
*  student, of course I want them locked up. I don't want them just having an issue. If they [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=805.6s)]
*  committed an assault, they crossed the line, they were physical, they were violent. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=810.96s)]
*  You gotta arrest that person, okay? By the way, that also applies to pro-Israel protesters [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=815.76s)]
*  who did significant violence at UCLA, and it was barely noted for the record, okay? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=820.72s)]
*  So one guy finally got arrested after. People are like, you're really not gonna arrest anyone? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=828.1600000000001s)]
*  Their faces are right there, and they clearly attack with sticks and weapons, etc. They're like, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=832.1600000000001s)]
*  yeah, but it is a pro-Israel side. I mean, we can't, I mean, that side is sacred. They could say the [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=838.32s)]
*  most terrible things about Muslims, call all of them terrorists, no one cares. They could beat up [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=844.08s)]
*  innocent students, no one cares. But my God, Israel's been offended, take pictures of everyone. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=850.24s)]
*  And because remember, it isn't just about that kind of legal action. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=856.0s)]
*  There are people that have, it's billionaires that have said that they're taking names from those [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=859.92s)]
*  demonstrators and not based on people who did anything either violent or even any kind of [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=866.8s)]
*  speech they didn't like. If you're at a peace protest, they're saying they will never hire you [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=872.16s)]
*  on Wall Street. They've got a blacklist. I'm not saying it, they're saying it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=877.76s)]
*  And I think they, and by the way, you think you're fighting antisemitism when you do that? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  You drive up antisemitism when you loudly declare we have a blacklist for anyone who opposes Israel [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=887.04s)]
*  and will destroy your career if you're going to Columbia, Harvard, or anywhere else, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=893.92s)]
*  if you dare protest against Israel. Jesus Christ, what are you doing? That is terrible for [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=897.92s)]
*  America, the Palestinians, but also for Israel and Jews. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=904.4s)]
*  So okay, now my guess is that what's gonna happen is, he said, I said no more foreign students, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=907.92s)]
*  okay? How much does somebody wanna bet that Israeli students will be let in? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=914.8s)]
*  That they'll be like, well, of course, I mean, if you're from Africa, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna take you, Middle East, you're instantly, but I don't even wanna listen to you, okay? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=926.64s)]
*  Everywhere else has been Israeli students, come right in, come right in. Look, it hasn't happened [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=931.04s)]
*  yet, and maybe I'm wrong, and then you'll get to say, Cenk, you were wrong, okay? And is this [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  vetting for America? The student's coming in, we're gonna vet them, he says. So if you're a [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=940.48s)]
*  foreign student applying here, man, we're gonna go through your social media and all of your life [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=945.12s)]
*  and find out how dangerous you are. To America? No, to Israel. We're gonna see if you've criticized [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=950.0s)]
*  Israel at all, and then we're gonna ban you from Israel? No, from America. Guys, this is a freaking [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=956.4s)]
*  joke. None of this has anything to do with anti-Semitism. So it doesn't mean that people [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=961.84s)]
*  aren't legitimately worried about anti-Semitism as Israel is committing atrocity after atrocity [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=967.28s)]
*  after atrocity. And then having the Israeli lobby stand up and do standing ovations for a terrorist [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=973.6s)]
*  like Netanyahu in our Congress, is that making people mad? Yes, it's making people mad, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=982.08s)]
*  okay? And so I'm worried about the rise of anti-Semitism. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=987.2800000000001s)]
*  Also worried about the rise of Islamophobia, but I'm the only one in the country [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=990.32s)]
*  of the other Muslims. But that is not the main issue at all, that is 100% a lie. The main issue [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  is the Israeli lobby has told their dog, Donald Trump, you are to arrest, hound, and kick out of [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1004.5600000000001s)]
*  the country anyone who dares disagree with the terrorist government of Israel. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1011.36s)]
*  And any time an administration engages in this type of overreach, when they attempt to censor or [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1015.6800000000001s)]
*  punish either a group of people or an institution for not carrying out whatever it is they want to [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1024.4s)]
*  carry out or doing exactly what they want to do. When the government becomes too big, well, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1030.56s)]
*  the next incoming administration, which could be a democratic administration, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1036.72s)]
*  could target conservative universities, because those exist. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1041.12s)]
*  And I don't want to live in that kind of world. I don't want to live in a kind of world where [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1046.96s)]
*  any presidential administration that's politically motivated starts targeting universities that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1050.96s)]
*  don't do as he or she says. That's when government has become too big. So I think the administration [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1058.0s)]
*  has really opened a Pandora's box here. Let's see what the future holds. But for now, Harvard's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1065.12s)]
*  fighting back and really it's the only institution, the only university that's been fighting back. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1070.08s)]
*  Yeah, okay, I just last two things. Just on your point about language, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1073.76s)]
*  Anna, if you're on a college campus, you gotta hear everyone out. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1078.32s)]
*  So I don't wanna ban pro-Israel positions. I don't wanna ban anti-Israel positions, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1082.56s)]
*  pro-Saudi, anti-Saudi, pro this, anti that, I don't care. And this applies just as much to the left [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1086.7199999999998s)]
*  as it does to the right. And let's be honest and real, more to the left than it does on the right [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1093.84s)]
*  on college campuses, okay? Okay, no, you don't need a safe space. You need a safe space [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1098.72s)]
*  from physical harm. That's fine, okay? You don't need a safe space from language. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1104.1599999999999s)]
*  Grow up, okay? My God, they hurt my feelings. I can't stand that when someone says [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1111.12s)]
*  that about criticism of Israel. I also can't stand that when someone says it about criticism [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1119.12s)]
*  of anything. I mean, Jesus Christ, the criticism of Muslims is like a tsunami in America. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1124.1599999999999s)]
*  If I was debilitated by that or any Muslim in America was debilitated by that, we couldn't [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1131.76s)]
*  function, right? Just let's go, let's go. You address speech with other speech. You don't melt, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1137.6s)]
*  you don't need a safe space, especially on a college campus. You need to hear each other out [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1145.12s)]
*  no matter how much it offends you. And that's why we have these conversations on the air here. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1150.4799999999998s)]
*  And lastly, if you were truly concerned about anti-Semitism, and there are a lot of people [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1155.1999999999998s)]
*  who are truly concerned about anti-Semitism, the number one thing you would do is what? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1160.56s)]
*  Shut down criticism of Israel or fight to make sure that Netanyahu loses power in Israel [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1164.6399999999999s)]
*  because there's no one on planet Earth driving anti-Semitism as much as Netanyahu. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1171.36s)]
*  If you're a logical person, that is not a close question. You would do everything in your effort [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  to make sure that Netanyahu is out of power in Israel. And you would do everything in your power [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1181.6799999999998s)]
*  to get a two-state solution because occupying another people in a horrific fashion for 58 years [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1186.32s)]
*  is not helping the cause of eradicating anti-Semitism. Two states that are perfectly [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1194.1599999999999s)]
*  safe and independent would, then we could all go back to cheering for both of those states, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1200.64s)]
*  Palestine and Israel. And wouldn't that be a beautiful world with a lot less anti-Semitism [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1207.2s)]
*  and a safe Israel? That's what you would do if you were a logical person really worried about [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1212.5600000000002s)]
*  anti-Semitism. But if you're not really worried about that, you just want everybody to shut up [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1217.6000000000001s)]
*  about Israel, then you would say, I am so concerned about anti-Semitism. We must arrest anyone who [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1222.5600000000002s)]
*  criticizes Israel. Yeah, that's not America, man. Go find another country. That's not America. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1228.88s)]
*  And Donald Trump is un-American for trying to limit our speech on college campus or anyone else. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJdNaLemkxY&t=1234.3200000000002s)]
