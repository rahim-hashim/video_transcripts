# Burr Breakdown - April 18, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w)
*  has just been not good. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm so upset, my God. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2.6s)]
*  Drop it like it's our rights. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=65.32s)]
*  All right, welcome the young Turks on this lovely Friday. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=71.8s)]
*  Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Ramesh Turnivasan, Ramesh is a host of the Utopias podcast, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=91.52s)]
*  and a professor at UCLA. Of course, John is the host of Damage Report. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=96.88s)]
*  So today we've got some fairly disastrous news for you throughout. So we had some defections from [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=102.0s)]
*  Trump yesterday. We had Trump actually doing one thing positive yesterday, deciding not to bomb [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Iran. We're back to negatives, thoroughly so. And later in the program, yes, a US citizen has [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=116.96s)]
*  been detained by ICE. So we will give details on that. And so that has begun. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=125.84s)]
*  Well, that's great news about Iran as long as Trump's against it. Unfortunately, what if Elon [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=132.64s)]
*  Mustells, the Department of Defense, start bombing them? I guess maybe they'll just do it according [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=137.68s)]
*  to recent news. But anyway, why don't we talk about a different conflict, not one that might [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=142.72s)]
*  come, but one that might not end, starting with this. But I want to stop the war. I don't want [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=147.84s)]
*  that war to continue. And I'll stop that war, mark my words. I'll stop that war in 24 hours. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=153.84s)]
*  We need to figure out here now, with a matter of days, whether this is doable [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  in the short term. Because if it's not, then I think we're just gonna move on from our perspective. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=165.44s)]
*  The president feels very strongly about that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=170.32s)]
*  Those two guys should probably talk. Of course, that was Donald Trump back in 2023, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  back when he was in the mode of claiming that he would accomplish everything in 24 hours, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=178.16s)]
*  including ending the war in Ukraine. He told us to mark his words, and we have. And it doesn't [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=182.48s)]
*  matter because the buck stops anywhere other than with Donald Trump. He probably doesn't even [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=188.24s)]
*  remember the conflict is even happening. But he's also, over the past couple of months, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=192.88s)]
*  been implying that he's gonna force Ukraine to accept some sort of deal on the terms of Russia. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=197.52s)]
*  And that sounded bad enough. Now, according to Marco Rubio, there might not be anything. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  He might just wash his hands of the entire thing and let Russia do literally 100% of whatever they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  want, which, Cenk, maybe not the biggest surprise. But this is just another area where Trump might be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  preemptively either giving up or letting someone else control what happens. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=222.56s)]
*  Part of the deal? No, kidding. No, so a bit of a disaster here. The main question I have, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=227.68s)]
*  and we'll see if we can answer it in giving you the details of the story is, yes, but what happens [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=235.28s)]
*  when we just let it go? Does that mean we let the Ukrainians go and let the Russians just do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  whatever they want to them? Does that mean we keep funding them at the same rate that we're funding [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=248.88s)]
*  them? What in the world does he mean? Let's try to figure it out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=253.04s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it's pretty much what you said. I think it's letting whatever Russia wants to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=257.36s)]
*  happen happen. That's my fear. But that said, let's hear more from Marco Rubio and see what [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  he has to say about it. I think it's important to remind everybody that the Ukraine war is a [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=265.68s)]
*  terrible thing, but it's not our war. We didn't start it. The United States has been helping [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=271.2s)]
*  Ukraine for over the last three years, and we want it to end. But it's not our war. I want everyone [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=275.12s)]
*  to understand that. And the reason why I make that point is the president has spent 87 days [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=280.72s)]
*  at the highest level of his government repeatedly taking efforts to bring this war to an end. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=284.8s)]
*  We are now reaching a point where we need to decide and determine whether this is even possible or [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=290.16s)]
*  not. I can tell you this. This war has no military solution to it. It really doesn't. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=295.36s)]
*  It's not gonna be decided with, neither side has some strategic capability to end this war quickly. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=300.24s)]
*  And so what we're talking about here is avoiding thousands and thousands of people from dying over [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  the next year. We're trying to avoid that. We saw what happened last weekend with a missile strike [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=310.0s)]
*  in Sumi where people died on Palm Sunday. We're just gonna see more like that on both sides. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=314.4s)]
*  We're gonna see more of that. We're trying to prevent it. But we're not gonna continue to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=318.96s)]
*  fly all over the world and do meeting after meeting after meeting. There's no progress [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=322.48s)]
*  is being made. So if they're serious about peace, either side or both, we wanna help. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=326.56s)]
*  If it's not gonna happen, then we're just gonna move on. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=331.12s)]
*  Oh, I was actually prepared in this segment to be pretty critical of the Secretary of State [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=333.52s)]
*  effectively washing his hands of this conflict. I didn't know that he had to fly places and take [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=339.76s)]
*  meetings. That does sound very exhausting. People talk so much about the strength and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=345.52s)]
*  toughness of the Ukrainian people. Have they had to fly around the world? Have they had to take [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=351.44s)]
*  meetings? They don't know the first thing about suffering. Marco Rubio is the one who's suffering [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  in this thing. But anyway, he's much more focused there on saying that it's not our conflict. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=360.64s)]
*  We didn't start it. Who did start it? Well, depends on who you ask. If you ask literally [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  anyone who knows what's going on, obviously it was Russia. But if you ask the Trump administration, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=370.56s)]
*  it was Ukraine. One of the fundamental issues probably making it more difficult for them to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=374.32s)]
*  actually end this conflict, that they refuse to even acknowledge the truth about it or what Ukraine [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  maybe deserves coming out of it. So why would Ukraine accept any of the horridly biased deals [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=383.68s)]
*  that they're offering right now? That said, we're gonna have Trump and JD Vance's take on all of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=390.64s)]
*  this. But Cenk, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in and respond to Rubio there. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=396.0s)]
*  Yeah, so Trump's gonna back him up as you're gonna see in a second. So look, first, I guess a lot of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=398.8s)]
*  the right wing thinks that they've just accepted that he's an absurd human being. But I wish we [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=407.6s)]
*  hadn't accepted that in our president. And here's what I mean by that. They use it to solve it in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=413.04s)]
*  24 hours. Did anyone really believe that? Are you now, are you super frustrated with Trump that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=418.24s)]
*  he didn't solve it magically in 24 hours? Or have you moved to go post along with him and said, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  we didn't mean 24 hours. And we didn't mean three months, we meant maybe never. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  And so that's moving a lot of goals, brothers, okay? So now his second question is, if you think, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=439.68s)]
*  well, no, look, I know the president is absurd and he says ridiculous things to get attention. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=448.8s)]
*  And I've made my peace with it. And as long as he makes peace in this particular conflict, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=455.12s)]
*  I don't care that he's grandiose and at times buffoonish. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=459.68s)]
*  I wish we hadn't made peace with that. And when it comes to being the president of the United [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=464.32s)]
*  States, which we had a serious person who actually meant what he said instead of making up ridiculous [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=470.88s)]
*  things. Now, to the heart of the issue, if all this somehow magically gets them to a peace deal, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=476.08s)]
*  then great, I don't really care about the ups and downs of negotiations, etc. But does it look like [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=482.48s)]
*  we're close to a peace deal? Because it doesn't look like it to me. And so now they're at the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=489.28s)]
*  point where they're almost throwing their hands up, right? So remember that one of the issues [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=493.12s)]
*  here was that everything was going along well, I don't know about fine, they were at least doing [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=501.04s)]
*  negotiations. But then Trump and the US demanded mineral rights in Ukraine. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=507.2s)]
*  They demanded $500 in mineral rights. And so that is much, much worse than to give up on it's an epic disaster. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=513.2s)]
*  Ramesh, do you want to jump in? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=528.48s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Look, what's been incredibly unclear the whole time. I mean, first, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=535.52s)]
*  Cenk makes a great point that the president boasted that within 24 hours he could end this [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=544.8000000000001s)]
*  conflict. I think he assumed that since he's so chummy with Putin, they would actually be able to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=551.28s)]
*  get through to Putin and negotiate some sort of deal that was good for Putin. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=556.48s)]
*  And maybe forced to be accepted by the Ukrainians and all the rest of us. But clearly, we see [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=563.76s)]
*  that the president does not have nearly the power, deal making power, or even the political power [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=571.76s)]
*  that he claims to have after all of these theatrics and all of this sort of nauseating [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=580.24s)]
*  set of stories where he is essentially repeated systematically Russian state talking points. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=585.44s)]
*  And obviously publicly embarrassed Zelensky to try to push him into a leverage position [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=593.44s)]
*  where he would agree to the mineral deal. What is under discussed as usual when it comes to [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=599.0400000000001s)]
*  this president is what exactly does he want? And what is the outcome he is pushing for? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  And for Marco Rubio to basically say there's no military solution, but essentially say that the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=612.08s)]
*  US is not able to do what it said it could do in 24 hours. And broker an actual peace agreement is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=619.36s)]
*  very telling. It speaks to the weakness of this administration, the weakness of its political [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=626.72s)]
*  leverage and the absence of a political vision. And one last point, note everybody that there were [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=632.0s)]
*  a couple ceasefires that were agreed to between the Ukrainians and the Russians brokered by [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=638.88s)]
*  international parties. Those ceasefires are not being observed as we speak, including in the Black [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=645.84s)]
*  Sea, or on grain shipments and so on. So nothing has been accomplished [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=651.4399999999999s)]
*  rather than an enduring peace deal in 24 hours. So take that as a contrast. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=656.64s)]
*  Yeah, Trump, he doesn't know anything about negotiations. He doesn't know anything about [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=660.64s)]
*  diplomacy. He blusters and he threatens and sometimes if we happen in an area to have some [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=666.4s)]
*  sort of overwhelming advantage, we might get people to just cow before us or whatever. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=672.08s)]
*  But even that doesn't operate or work as often as he thinks it does. He thought that that would get [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=676.64s)]
*  him through this entire trade war thing and it didn't work out that way. So he doesn't know what's [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=681.1999999999999s)]
*  going on. He doesn't care to know what Ukraine would need to actually sign on to some sort of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=685.52s)]
*  peace deal. And so the future just looks really dark. That said, we did say that we would give [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=692.56s)]
*  you what Trump has to say about Rubio's most recent comments. So why don't we get to that and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=698.64s)]
*  then we'll update you on a few more of the recent wrinkles. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=701.92s)]
*  Secretary Rubio said that the US will have to figure out whether a deal can be done between [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=704.4s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine in a matter of days or you will just move on. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=712.0s)]
*  Yeah, very short. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=716.48s)]
*  How many days is that? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=717.52s)]
*  No specific number of days, but quickly. If for some reason one of the two parties makes it [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=719.36s)]
*  very difficult, we're just gonna say you're foolish, you're fools, you're horrible people, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=726.56s)]
*  and we're gonna just take a pass. But hopefully we won't have to do that. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=731.76s)]
*  Okay, so importantly, there are two parts to that. So one is how many days, no specific number [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=736.48s)]
*  because he has no idea. He has no idea with this as he does with anything else. Don't ask [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=743.76s)]
*  him for specifics on what his administration is gonna do. He is clearly not in charge in many of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=748.8s)]
*  these topics. The other area though is way clearer. He says if one of the side is being really [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=754.24s)]
*  irresponsible, we're gonna say that they're terrible, horrible people. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=760.88s)]
*  I wonder which side he's talking about. I wonder, I wonder, probably both. I think he's probably [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=764.8s)]
*  willing to call Putin horrible too, not just Zelensky and the Ukrainians. No, that's obviously [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=770.16s)]
*  ridiculous. And look, that's supposed to be playing hardball. But again, if you're Zelensky, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=774.8s)]
*  just constantly being punched in the face by this guy after you've already, as Cenk alluded to, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=778.96s)]
*  you've already agreed to an incredibly unjust mineral sharing deal, sharing like we had any [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=784.08s)]
*  claim to it in the first place. You've already given Trump what he demanded, his pound of flesh. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  And he's continually insulting you, your administration, and the people of Ukraine. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  And now we find out that there was this meeting yesterday, one of the arduous meetings that's so [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  exhausting, Marco Rubio, people from officials from Ukraine, Europe, and the US all met in Paris. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=808.16s)]
*  And at the meeting, US officials proposed a ceasefire plan. And here are some of the [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=815.04s)]
*  issues with it, according to European officials. The proposal would effectively freeze the war [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=819.28s)]
*  with Ukrainian territories now occupied by Russia remaining under Moscow's control. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=824.64s)]
*  Kiev's aspirations of joining NATO would also be off the table. And on top of that, Russia [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=829.8399999999999s)]
*  not giving up literally anything, not a foot of territory would also. So now they never have to [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=836.16s)]
*  worry about Ukraine entering NATO, okay? So Ukraine will be no better prepared for a follow-on invasion [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=842.4s)]
*  a year or two years from now after this. And Russia gets relief from economic sanctions. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=847.92s)]
*  They get everything, I guess, other than the entirety of Ukraine offered up on a silver platter. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  But even that, they're only not getting that immediately. They're definitely getting that in [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=861.76s)]
*  a few years. All of this utter madness, and Russia says, even in response to all this, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=866.64s)]
*  the root causes of the war have to be addressed before committing to a ceasefire. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=871.68s)]
*  The root cause of the war, to be clear, was Vladimir Putin invading the goddamn country. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=875.92s)]
*  That's the root cause of the war. I know the nonsense they would spin that like, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=880.7199999999999s)]
*  Ukraine is talking about joining a defensive alliance or something. I just want you to think [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=884.56s)]
*  about how utterly insane that is. Let's say I hear tell that one of my neighbors is talking [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=888.32s)]
*  with my other neighbor. And they're setting up some sort of deal where if I rob one of their [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=894.08s)]
*  houses, they'll both shoot me. And my response is, I robbed his house that night. I don't seem like [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=898.6400000000001s)]
*  the good guy in that story, do I? It seems like inevitably I was gonna rob the house. I just wanted [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=904.96s)]
*  to do it under the right circumstances. And that is exactly what is going on with Russia. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=910.4000000000001s)]
*  They were preparing to at some point invade and conquer Ukraine and likely other former Soviet [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=916.08s)]
*  republics. And they didn't like the idea that Ukraine entering NATO would stop them from doing [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=921.2800000000001s)]
*  that. There is no reason that Ukraine being a member of NATO would bother a country that had [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  no interest in actually invading it. It just doesn't make any logical sense. Ramesh, any thoughts [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=931.0400000000001s)]
*  about Donald Trump or any of the other stuff I've said? Well, Russia has already showed long before [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=936.48s)]
*  this latest set of acts the last few years that it would invade Crimea. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=941.2s)]
*  And it's interesting how our current administration is sort of playing up isolationism in certain [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=946.88s)]
*  ways without recognizing our own kind of complicity in militarizing the world. And I think a big part [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=955.76s)]
*  of that is the worship, as Cenk was alluding to earlier, of the gilded age that this administration [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=962.96s)]
*  has. We can stay isolated, we're just gonna be about ourselves. But whenever we can do land grabs [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=969.36s)]
*  or resource grabs, let's do it, which is an old school colonial imperialist kind of approach. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=974.16s)]
*  That said, I do think this is not any justification for any of Russia's actions who [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=980.64s)]
*  started the war, clearly. But the US has not been an honest partner with its decisions it stated [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  after the fall of the Berlin Wall that NATO would not expand east of Berlin. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=996.24s)]
*  That said, there's clearly a reason why all of these nations that are generally peaceful [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1004.16s)]
*  want to join NATO. So what is very sad to me is that the US did not show any leadership [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1012.5600000000001s)]
*  since the fall of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1020.08s)]
*  could have brokered an actual real kind of peace agreement that we could be observing to this day. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1023.2s)]
*  Propped up people like Yeltsin, who then basically, whose pathetic regime led to the rise of Putin and [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1030.8s)]
*  the oligarchs and the deal he cut with the oligarchs. And some of that is uncannily like [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1038.72s)]
*  what we're looking at right now in this country. So it's very sad. US didn't show any leadership [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1042.64s)]
*  then, and it's not showing any leadership now. And that basically is gonna give Russia carte [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1047.28s)]
*  blanche to be as aggressive and militaristic as it wants. And it's certainly it is not without [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1051.76s)]
*  question that Putin would want to expand and get back to something approximating the Russian empire. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1056.32s)]
*  But the key for me is de-escalation rather than escalation. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1062.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, 100%. And while all this is ongoing, I feel terrible for the people of Ukraine who [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1065.52s)]
*  have been through unimaginable situations for literally years now. Effectively being told by [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1071.52s)]
*  what's supposed to be sort of like one of the moral forces for safety, security, peace, all of that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1076.8s)]
*  Telling them either give up your country now or we're not gonna help you get any deal and then [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1083.84s)]
*  it'll be taken from you over the next year or two. But a horrid abdication of our place in the world. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1089.44s)]
*  In any event, we're gonna take a short break. We'll come back with more after this. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1095.84s)]
*  Welcome back one of the first hour of the Young Turks with myself and Ramesh. Ramesh and I had [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1106.8s)]
*  a little talk during the break and we both felt like Jake was talking too much and our takes are [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1124.0s)]
*  too important. We want more time. So we banished him. He's gone. We're gonna send Senator Chris [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1128.6399999999999s)]
*  Van Hollen to go talk to him in the meantime. But anyway, we do have important news to get to [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1133.84s)]
*  Ramesh. You ready for some more? Yeah, totally man. Okay, but Jake will be back in just a little bit. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1138.56s)]
*  But anyway, in the meantime, let's jump into this. The White House says that you will identify and [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1143.12s)]
*  excuse yourself from any conflicts of interest that you may have. Does that mean that you are [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1148.48s)]
*  in effect policing yourself? What are the checks and balances that are in place to ensure that [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1153.28s)]
*  there's accountability and transparency? Well, we actually are trying to be as transparent [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1157.76s)]
*  as possible. In fact, our actions repost our actions to the Doge handle on X. If you see [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1163.04s)]
*  anything, you say like, wait a second. Hey, that doesn't that seems like maybe that's, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1169.68s)]
*  there's a conflict there. I felt like people are gonna be shy about saying that. They'll say it [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1174.8s)]
*  immediately. Yeah, that's why they had to change so goddamn many of the things they posted on that [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1178.96s)]
*  stupid BS website. But that was Elon Musk saying that you don't have to worry about him rigging [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1185.68s)]
*  things in his favor, hurting his competitors, giving himself contracts because he's gonna be [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1191.2s)]
*  transparent. And I don't buy that in most cases, but I think he has been pretty transparent in some [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1195.76s)]
*  of the corruption, including the story that we're gonna talk about today. Because Reuters released [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1201.68s)]
*  a report just yesterday alleging that Musk is about to make a massive amount of money off the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1206.0s)]
*  federal government. Here's the headline. Musk's SpaceX is apparently a front runner to build [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1211.76s)]
*  Trump's golden dome missile shield. And that is going to be worth importantly, not only [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1216.56s)]
*  an ungodly amount of money to initially set up, but going forward, it could be massive money for [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1223.84s)]
*  Elon Musk and for SpaceX. Cenk, I know you've been waiting to talk about this. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1230.1599999999999s)]
*  Musk and SpaceX building this system seems pretty convenient considering he's the co-president. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1235.36s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, utter outrage. The largest donor to any presidential candidate [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1241.6000000000001s)]
*  in any party, right? Just say, I got a great idea. By the way, first, let's do cuts to like Head Start [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1250.24s)]
*  and funding malaria treatment and all these to social security offices, to Medicaid, etc. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1258.4s)]
*  But let's not save any money at all. Let's direct it all to my company. Well, if you're not outraged [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1266.48s)]
*  by that, then you like corruption, you love corruption. And really, if you're a maga, you [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1273.76s)]
*  think, what a coincidence. The top donors company, it happens to be the best company for a project, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1278.6399999999999s)]
*  by the way, we don't need at all. This is as big a boondoggle as you will ever find. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1286.8s)]
*  Doge went looking for waste, fraud and abuse. But what we didn't realize is they were looking [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1294.4s)]
*  to find it so they could promote it within the government. Because this is waste, fraud and [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1300.64s)]
*  abuse. So we thought they were going to find it to eliminate it, but apparently they were going to [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1305.84s)]
*  find it to put it on steroids, because that's what this is. What the hell is this crap? And what [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1310.8799999999999s)]
*  happened to cutting the Pentagon? I mean, that's why you get them on the record. So now you can [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1316.8s)]
*  turn around and go, come on, come on. And yes, even your own voters wanted you to cut the Pentagon. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1321.52s)]
*  Instead, you're doing the boondoggle of all boondoggles. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1330.32s)]
*  100%, yeah. So I'm gonna give you a couple extra layers of corruption, then we'll jump into a [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1333.36s)]
*  conversation about this. So first, the details. What is the Golden Dome? Well, it's pretty [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1338.16s)]
*  different than the Iron Dome. And not only because it is a characteristically stupid name [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1343.52s)]
*  via Donald Trump and the Golden Dome. So it's a plan to put up 400 to 1,000 satellites to orbit [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1348.8s)]
*  the world. They would be tasked with sensing, monitoring and tracking missile launches. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1354.96s)]
*  Then a separate batch of 200 more attack satellites would then destroy those with [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1359.44s)]
*  a combination of missiles and or lasers. So we're back in Reagan era Star Wars policies. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1364.6399999999999s)]
*  And Reuters notes that the plan is highly subject to change. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1371.28s)]
*  Probably because there will be world outrage because you're not supposed to be surrounding [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1374.8s)]
*  the earth with weaponized satellites. There are multiple treaties designed to stop that. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1378.8s)]
*  But that's the idea. So SpaceX and this would be partnering with software maker, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1382.96s)]
*  Palantir and drone builder, Anderil on a bid to build key parts of the Golden Dome. The [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1387.44s)]
*  CEOs, the founders, I should say of those two other companies also have been donors to Donald [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1393.52s)]
*  Trump in the past. So there's a lot of corruption to go around to be fair. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1398.0s)]
*  Now SpaceX is pitching for the part of the initiative called the custody layer. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1402.48s)]
*  That's to do preliminary engineering and design work that would cost between 6 billion and 10 [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1406.72s)]
*  billion dollars. Probably exactly between that because every time a defense contractor estimates [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1412.3200000000002s)]
*  the cost of something, that's what it ends up being. Now there were about 180 different [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1418.16s)]
*  companies that expressed interest. Strange that SpaceX would be the leader in this right now, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1423.1200000000001s)]
*  except not so much. And it is, when you get the reporting from Reuters, it's as bad as it could [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1430.48s)]
*  possibly be. One of the sources familiar with the talks described them as a quote departure from the [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1435.3600000000001s)]
*  usual acquisition process. There's an attitude that the national security and defense community [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1440.64s)]
*  has to be sensitive and deferential to Elon Musk because of his role in the government. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1446.4s)]
*  They're not even trying to hide that this is a blatantly corrupt act. And then the added layer [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1452.4s)]
*  of corruption is that we don't just pay a ton of money, not six to $10 billion, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1458.32s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars, almost certainly. And then we're done and we own it. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1462.8799999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, that's not how things work anymore in the tech industry. SpaceX has proposed setting up [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1467.6s)]
*  its role in Golden Dome as a subscription service in which the government would pay for access to [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1472.24s)]
*  the technology rather than own the system outright. So we would pay untold billions so that Elon Musk [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1477.6s)]
*  would own a fleet of attack satellites that ring the globe. We wouldn't even own it. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1486.56s)]
*  He'd have control of the software. He could turn it off if he wants to. He could let missiles go [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1492.3999999999999s)]
*  by if he wants to. He would have even more control over world affairs than he already does [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1497.9199999999998s)]
*  thanks to Starlink. And in return, we pay him a massive amount of money now, and then we pay him [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1502.24s)]
*  money every month for the rest of our natural lives. Cenk, this sucks. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1507.52s)]
*  No, no, it's even worse than what you're stating and what I said at the beginning. Because [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1512.8799999999999s)]
*  when you think about the fact that then Elon would own it and it's a subscription service, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1517.28s)]
*  well, think about it. If we stop paying the subscription, someone else can. And in fact, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1522.3999999999999s)]
*  since it's a company that's, as with all companies, are designed to maximize profit, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  well, they're gonna say, well, I built this whole thing. I mean, you suckers paid for it, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1533.6s)]
*  but it's mine. I own it and I wanna make more money off of it. So I am now handing over the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1537.1999999999998s)]
*  satellite system to the highest bidder. Look at that, it's China. Well, what are you gonna do? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1541.76s)]
*  Now China has a ring of satellites across the world that could destroy anything that they want. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1546.72s)]
*  So, well, okay, that's point one, okay, in a parade of horribles that are actually [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1552.56s)]
*  possible in this case. Point two is, what if Elon just goes, what do I need America or China for? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1557.76s)]
*  I now own the satellites all across the world that can knock down anything I want, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1564.8799999999999s)]
*  destroy anything I want, mission accomplished. Why do you think I took over the American [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1570.24s)]
*  government? So, by the way, this sounds like a science fiction movie, sounds far-fetched, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1575.92s)]
*  etc. But there is no option C. So option A is, this is a massive boondoggle. It's never going [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1581.28s)]
*  to work and we're gonna waste hundreds of billions of dollars and they're gonna go straight into Elon [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1590.8s)]
*  Musk's pocket. And the worst fraud, waste and abuse you've ever seen, the worst corruption you've [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1595.6s)]
*  ever seen, that's option A. Option B is it does work, but we spend all that money and we don't [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1602.1599999999999s)]
*  even own it. And a private person can literally control who wins wars, who doesn't win wars, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1608.32s)]
*  would literally run the globe. My answer to this, hell to the effing no. No way, no how, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1614.8799999999999s)]
*  pure insanity. And I talk about corporate rule all the time on this show. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1622.96s)]
*  This would let one corporation literally rule us all. Ramesh. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1627.9199999999998s)]
*  Right, absolutely. So feel free to use the word doge as a verb to just describe any time anyone [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1633.04s)]
*  gets ripped off, corrupted, taken advantage of and grifted upon. I mean, me and my friends, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1641.36s)]
*  maybe it's just some way we're trying to cope with all of this. We just love saying, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  hey, you're being dogeing, dogeing, dogeing. So we can, I just think there's something really [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1651.52s)]
*  interesting here though that I wanna add to both your analyses, which is what this is exactly how [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1660.72s)]
*  tech companies and tech platforms function. They promise transparency, but they're really [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1666.16s)]
*  not transparent at all. And they leverage public investments, including people's data. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1671.28s)]
*  In this case, our money and our resources, maybe not our data, but that's in other capacities, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1677.84s)]
*  with no accountability whatsoever. And the idea of sort of a subscription service is also very [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1683.28s)]
*  straight out of big tech. How do we make as much money while giving our users next to nothing, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1690.9599999999998s)]
*  no matter what the causes are, right? So for example, when we talk about tech and [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1700.0s)]
*  whether it's AI or social media, you can imagine a pretty reasonable proposal that would pay people [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1704.88s)]
*  for their data. Is that any of that happening? No, instead what a subscription model assumes [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1709.6000000000001s)]
*  and mandates is ongoing continuous never ending dependency, right? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1717.0400000000002s)]
*  So that's the first point I wanna make. This is very tech, big tech like the way this is being [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1722.72s)]
*  played. The other thing I wanna say is, I mean, sometimes my podcast is called Utopias. I'm always [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1728.64s)]
*  looking for something to make me put me in a more positive mood in the evenings. I was actually [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1737.2s)]
*  nerding out about the incredible James Webb telescope discoveries. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1743.2800000000002s)]
*  You all may have heard of that possibly we found traces of life on another planet or at least the [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1747.76s)]
*  elements that could be produced only by organic life. Why am I saying all that? That's NASA. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1753.6s)]
*  That's what NASA did. That's what government funding of science and education and research does. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1760.9599999999998s)]
*  Think about NASA relative to SpaceX, which I consider a zombie predator version of NASA, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1768.0s)]
*  right? Think about how different these things are. And we must all ask questions. What do we [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1775.04s)]
*  actually want to support? And what do we not? Yeah, by the way, the only other final point I [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1779.84s)]
*  have to make on this is the way that this should work if we hadn't had our government entirely [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1785.9199999999998s)]
*  bought by an oligarch is you'd have SpaceX come and be like, hey, we wanna do this thing and [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1791.36s)]
*  we're gonna make it a subscription service where you don't actually own it. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1797.12s)]
*  And then the Pentagon would be like, hey, the thing about that is there's 180 companies that [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1800.24s)]
*  would love this contract. So go kick rocks. Go if you can afford it, go suck an egg. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1805.28s)]
*  And we're gonna go with one of the other 100 plus companies that would love to do this. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1810.48s)]
*  But unfortunately, our government has been bought. So SpaceX knows they can make it absolutely [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1815.44s)]
*  horrible offer. And I guess the government will just take it [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1820.48s)]
*  because there's not gonna be any actual competition. Again, I know that it's difficult [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1824.48s)]
*  for the Democrats to fight back on everything because there's so many things they need to be [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1828.8s)]
*  fighting back on. But this feels like a pretty big one. I feel like you could score something on [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1832.32s)]
*  this. Anyway. Yeah, I have last two words from our audience. So you'll have to forgive their [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1836.3999999999999s)]
*  bluntness. And you could join their bluntness at tyt.com. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1844.8s)]
*  Infinity says, is Elon Musk Dr. Evil or Lex Luthor? And it's a good question. And we're hoping Dr. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1849.6s)]
*  Evil so that he's clownish and does not succeed in any of this. And Turkish Taffy writes in, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1856.96s)]
*  Elon gets the golden dome. The US taxpayers get the golden shower. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1863.28s)]
*  I like it. Okay, well- With their trickle down economics on the five and a half trillion dollar [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1869.52s)]
*  tax cut. So unfortunately, it's a theme. And I will say, yeah, Mike Myers playing [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1874.64s)]
*  Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live. Mike Myers, former Dr. Evil, Austin Powers is pretty priceless. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1880.48s)]
*  It all comes back around. It's perfect circle there. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1886.56s)]
*  The Trump administration is now asking Congress to completely eliminate funding for [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1907.6s)]
*  Head Start. If they do that, or sorry, when they do that, that would cut early education for more [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1912.16s)]
*  than half a million of the nation's neediest children and childcare for their family. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1917.6000000000001s)]
*  And before we give you all the details on this, I just, I love history and I love context. So I'd [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1923.2s)]
*  just like to remind you that, hey, this was another thing that was in project 2025. Eliminate Head [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1928.48s)]
*  Start. Just kill the entire thing. Screw over those who need access to childcare in rural America. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1934.88s)]
*  Isn't it strange that basically all of these moves as designated by project 2045, particularly [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1941.2s)]
*  screw over people in rural areas. The sort of thing that should bother the MAGA movement, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1946.24s)]
*  but doesn't seem to. In any event, the proposal, the initial details of their call to kill Head [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1950.24s)]
*  Start was tucked into a 64 page internal draft budget document obtained by the AP that seeks [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1956.24s)]
*  deep cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services. That's another important story. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1962.0s)]
*  More than a third of the entire budget for HHS being talked about being destroyed. We're not [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1967.12s)]
*  gonna focus on that here, but just understand there's a lot of insane doge cuts to go around. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1972.08s)]
*  But according to the draft, it says the budget does not fund Head Start. It says eliminating [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1977.76s)]
*  the program is consistent with the Trump administration's quote, goals of returning [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1982.4799999999998s)]
*  control of education to the states and increasing parental control. The federal government should [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1986.32s)]
*  not be in the business of mandating curriculum locations and performance standards for any form [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1991.76s)]
*  of education, which does not really in any way describe what Head Start does. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=1996.72s)]
*  And the idea that poor families desperately trying to have their kids be able to go to school, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2001.44s)]
*  that this would result in them having more control in literally any sense makes no sense. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2006.48s)]
*  But that's the cover story that they're making there. Now, spokespeople for Health and Human [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2013.04s)]
*  Services did not respond to a request for comment. This is the sort of thing that they're [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2017.44s)]
*  not gonna wanna talk about. They're just gonna wanna kill it and let you deal with the consequences. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2020.88s)]
*  But the executive director for the National Head Start Association, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2025.1999999999998s)]
*  Yasmina Vinci did actually say something. She said, it reflects a divestment in our future. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2028.32s)]
*  Eliminating funding for Head Start would be catastrophic. It would be a direct attack on [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2034.8s)]
*  our nation's most at risk children, their well being and their families. And by the way, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2039.1999999999998s)]
*  if you are not really familiar with Head Start, if you haven't had to use it or anything, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2045.12s)]
*  some people think of it as being like a preschool program, which in part it is, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2048.64s)]
*  but that's not all it does. It provides meals and health screenings. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2051.92s)]
*  It helps level the playing field for children who might otherwise fall behind [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2055.12s)]
*  before starting kindergarten. Many of the kids that are in Head Start and use its programs [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2058.8s)]
*  are in foster care or are homeless. And this helps them to maybe not be held back for their entire [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2064.16s)]
*  lives by that. It currently operates in all 50 states and parents who otherwise would not be [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2068.96s)]
*  able to afford childcare, rely on it when they work or go to school. Because otherwise, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2075.76s)]
*  they might not be able to do that. Again, it's a very difficult position that many of these [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2082.0800000000004s)]
*  people will be put in. And there doesn't seem to be any acknowledge of that from the Trump [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2086.32s)]
*  administration. What do you think, Cenk? Yeah, so this could affect up to 800,000 families. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2090.1600000000003s)]
*  And speaking of health that John alluded to, it's been shown that if kids are not in Head [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2098.4s)]
*  Start versus they are in Head Start, they've done studies like this. That if the kids not in [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2105.52s)]
*  Head Start have much more health issues down the road, which then costs us an enormous amount of [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2110.48s)]
*  money. So there's an excellent case to be made that Head Start actually saves us money in the [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2116.48s)]
*  long run, right? On just health issues, let alone everything else. So here we are again. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2121.2s)]
*  So they're gonna cut Head Start, a wonderful program that Americans love and is one of the [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2127.68s)]
*  government programs that has worked and is universally liked, except for of course, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2133.76s)]
*  hard right MAGA who says who cares about other people and they're the radical right. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2139.6000000000004s)]
*  And they think if it doesn't affect me, I don't care about other human beings at all, okay? But [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2144.96s)]
*  they're a very small minority. Overall, the country loves social security, Medicare and Head Start. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2151.0400000000004s)]
*  You can have debates about other topics and other policies, but they love those programs, right? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2156.2400000000002s)]
*  So now we're gonna cut from the average American and this affects everyone equally, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2161.44s)]
*  okay? This is not anything but general to the entire country, okay? Why? Because we need a [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2166.2400000000002s)]
*  five and a half trillion dollars for the tax cuts for the rich and for corporations. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2174.32s)]
*  And now on top of that, we're apparently gonna build some sort of golden dome for Elon Musk to [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2178.8s)]
*  control the world. And that's gonna cost a gargantuan amount of money and it's likely not [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2184.48s)]
*  going to work, okay? So in order to waste all of our money on tax cuts for corporations [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2189.76s)]
*  and subsidies and government contracts to Elon Musk, we're gonna have to cut programs for your [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2196.8s)]
*  kids and for your neighbor's kids and just devastate one of the few programs, not devastate, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2203.76s)]
*  eliminate one of the few government programs that the average American love. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2212.4s)]
*  So you just can't get worse than this. So these guys are the most obvious fake populists [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2218.32s)]
*  in human history. What kind of populism is this? Take from the average American and give to the [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2225.44s)]
*  literally the richest man in the world, garbage, nothing but garbage. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2232.16s)]
*  And it's so mean spirited and if you wanna talk about the total amount of money that would be [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2236.96s)]
*  saved from harming all of these children and their families, it's minuscule compared to what could be [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2241.44s)]
*  cut out of the Pentagon or any other sort of many other initiatives. But of course, that's not who [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2248.0s)]
*  they want to target. And remember all of these cuts are so that tax cuts can be conducted and [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2255.2s)]
*  passed through for the wealthiest of the wealthy Americans, going back to the Trump tax cuts. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2262.64s)]
*  So this is absolutely horrible. So not only is Cenk correct that Head Start, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2271.52s)]
*  I was looking into this a little bit before today. Not only is Head Start save incredible [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2278.64s)]
*  amounts of money because it sets kids up and their families up on the right track. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2286.24s)]
*  But there's actually pretty solid psychology research and developmental psychology research [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2291.36s)]
*  showing that that period before kindergarten is absolutely critical for in influencing what [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2297.52s)]
*  a young person's life will actually end up looking like. Their sort of mental and emotional and [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2305.52s)]
*  cognitive imprinting actually occurs and that's clear, peer reviewed science that shows that [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2310.8s)]
*  again and again and again. So this is just another horrible, horrible action of many. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2317.2s)]
*  And gosh, we just have to do everything we can to expose this as not populism, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2328.16s)]
*  as not actually insurrectionist. It's actually, if anything, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2336.56s)]
*  further cementing the status of the very few elites and oligarchs that are [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2340.4s)]
*  essentially in control in our country. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2346.16s)]
*  Well, I think with that, we should probably take our second break [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2348.0s)]
*  of the hour, but we've got a pretty fun one to close up the hour with, so don't go anywhere. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2350.4s)]
*  All right, back on to GYT, Cenk, John and Ramesh with you guys. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2369.92s)]
*  Earlier, Eclectic Miscellaneous wrote it, I was gonna say that it looks like Cenk's being [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2377.28s)]
*  detained against his will somewhere, but I guess under Trump, that's nothing to joke about. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2380.56s)]
*  But as you can tell, I escaped. But in the second hour, unfortunately, it gets not funny [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2385.04s)]
*  because they are now beginning to detain US citizens. Hedgehog Dragon says, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2391.6800000000003s)]
*  looks like Cenk is broadcasting from a study hall, but don't worry, we fixed it. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2395.52s)]
*  I'm now back at, as I said, Baratheon headquarters, and there it is. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2399.44s)]
*  Take your screen shot. Okay, Huang Jun asks on the Ukrainian issue, ask the Native Americans how [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2403.68s)]
*  much of a deal with the US government is worth. They can give us about 400 examples. So that [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2409.2000000000003s)]
*  refers, of course, to the original deal we had with the Ukrainians. Don't worry, we take your [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2414.0s)]
*  nukes away, we'll protect you forever. Unless we have a president who's super friendly with the [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2418.08s)]
*  government that wound up invading you, in which case, well, all bets are off. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2424.8s)]
*  So Haiku Dragon says, Cenk's featured word of the day, boondoggle. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2430.1600000000003s)]
*  Hard to argue with that. Newfie Dragon says, Ramesh is absolutely one of my favorite co-hosts. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2437.84s)]
*  So that's wonderfully here. And I've got more if we need it. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2443.04s)]
*  Okay, now, let's get back to the stories. John's got more for you. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2450.64s)]
*  Yes, I think it's only fair that we end with a little bit of fun, so let's jump into this. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2456.08s)]
*  This whole idea that other countries stole our jobs, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2461.52s)]
*  like our factory jobs and all that, as far as I remember, that's not the case. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2466.96s)]
*  Bilber has been good on a lot of topics having to do with politics for some time, but especially [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2473.6s)]
*  ever since Donald Trump got inaugurated, he's like must listen. And he decided to do kind of [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2477.68s)]
*  an impromptu history of capitalism, socialism, the labor movement on his podcast. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2482.24s)]
*  And so let's jump into a little bit about the Industrial Revolution, this next clip. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2488.96s)]
*  In the 1800s, during the, what was that period called? The Industrial Revolution. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2494.16s)]
*  They had kids working in factories in 12, 14 hours a day, it's like four, five-year-old kids [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2502.1600000000003s)]
*  in dangerous situations. And people weren't making any money. And the one guy who owned [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2508.0s)]
*  the factory was keeping all the money. The working man finally has enough. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2512.88s)]
*  They start organizing unions. The robber barons hire police, the army, all of these people to [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2517.28s)]
*  come in and kill these people in riots, crack their skulls, do unbelievable sorts of damage to [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2523.76s)]
*  them to try and force them to go back to work for sweatshop wages. These people died, were maimed, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2532.0800000000004s)]
*  catastrophic injuries so that we could have a decent wage in this country. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2541.36s)]
*  And they had unions and all of that. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2547.1200000000003s)]
*  All of what he's saying there is true and we'll have more from him. And it is such a massive, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2548.72s)]
*  I don't know, shame, feels like kind of a crime that after all that was done over the course of [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2556.72s)]
*  decades and decades to achieve all these amazing wins and to give us the life that we have right [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2562.24s)]
*  now. Most people have now been propagandized too for a couple decades and they despise unions. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2567.4399999999996s)]
*  They think that they're wasteful at best, corrupt, criminal, shouldn't be a part of them. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2573.3599999999997s)]
*  They should be crushed in fact, a populist Republican movement should probably kill [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2577.36s)]
*  unions. That's unfortunate. And before we discuss, I do just wanna dive into one thing that he talked [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2582.32s)]
*  about there. He talked about kids working in factories and things like that back in this prior [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2587.6s)]
*  movement. Well, get ready for that because we're already seeing it in multiple states, including [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2592.08s)]
*  just last month, Florida was debating lifting some child labor laws to fill jobs vacated by [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2597.2000000000003s)]
*  undocumented immigrants. Remember the jobs that undocumented immigrants took from good working [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2603.36s)]
*  adult Americans, except maybe not. And we do still need those workers. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2610.0s)]
*  And so I guess we're just gonna try to flood the labor market with cheap kids, I guess, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2616.0s)]
*  that won't be protected. That way we don't have to pay adults higher wages because it's more [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2620.7200000000003s)]
*  competitive. The entire thing is so nonsensical, but I do think it's a great time, Cenk, for this [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2624.8s)]
*  history lesson. Because this seems to be that period of time seems to be the model that Donald [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2629.6s)]
*  Trump and Elon Musk wanna take us back to. Yeah, I think the part of the propaganda that [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2634.72s)]
*  bothers me the most is when people talk about corporations like they're humans. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2639.7599999999998s)]
*  As Mitt Romney famously said, corporations are people, my friend. And of course, the Supreme [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2646.0s)]
*  Court said that in decisions of 76, 78, and then in Citizens United. And so [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2652.24s)]
*  then they have these absurd conversations about, well, are American companies gonna be patriotic? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2660.4799999999996s)]
*  Are they gonna do their duty? And they're not gonna do any of that. They're gonna maximize profit. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2666.3199999999997s)]
*  We wrote the code. I think we made a mistake. Other countries have written slightly different [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2671.52s)]
*  codes and that have gotten to better results. And we had one line in the code, maximize profit. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2676.56s)]
*  And that has led to them to doing all of these horrible things. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2682.3999999999996s)]
*  So it's basically like a robot. And people keep talking about, my God, what if the robots took [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2686.4799999999996s)]
*  over? Too late, they already took over. Those are corporate robots, and we program to maximize profit [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2692.16s)]
*  at our expense. And they've been doing it now for a long, long time. So yes, when they began the [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2699.6s)]
*  union movement, as Bill Burr is referring to, and they decided, hey, if we pull ourselves together [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2705.04s)]
*  here, we'll actually begin to have leverage. Otherwise, they can fire us one by one. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2712.0s)]
*  And they were right, and that leverage helped to get higher wages. And corporations despised it, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2716.64s)]
*  because it was higher cost for them. So for a while, they tried to break the unions and [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2721.92s)]
*  they literally murdered people, as Bill Burr is referring to, the Pinkertons, etc. Why? Because [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2726.32s)]
*  the only code was maximize profit. Morality be damned, community be damned, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2732.88s)]
*  we're workers be damned, this country be damned. So then they moved on to phase two. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2738.2400000000002s)]
*  So they said, all right, well, if you guys are gonna protect the average American, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2744.0s)]
*  we're gonna go to a country that doesn't protect the citizens. We're gonna go to China, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2747.6800000000003s)]
*  we're gonna go to Vietnam, etc. We're gonna find the lowest wages. These things are inevitable [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2751.28s)]
*  if you say the only rule you have is maximize profit. Those corporate machines will roll over [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2756.96s)]
*  all of us, the entire globe, and that's exactly what's happened. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2765.04s)]
*  So now that we've outsourced a lot of the jobs, but then we still need labor here, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2768.4s)]
*  because we have good unemployment numbers. But our wages have been stagnant since those [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2773.52s)]
*  Supreme Court decisions in 1976 and 78. And that's not an accident. And I talk about that in my book, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2778.88s)]
*  Justice is Coming. That's actually the single most important rule change that there was. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2784.8s)]
*  The activist justices on the Supreme Court said corporations are human beings, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2789.44s)]
*  they have speech rights and money of speech so they could buy all of our politicians, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2793.92s)]
*  unlimited bribery. And that is what ruined this country. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2798.7200000000003s)]
*  And now that they're kicking out more undocumented immigrants, they're saying, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2802.7200000000003s)]
*  well, we need child labor back. Because under no circumstances are these corporate machines [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2808.5600000000004s)]
*  going to serve you. We didn't write the code to serve us. We wrote the code to exploit us [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2814.48s)]
*  and to crush us so that they could make more money. We have to change the laws. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2820.88s)]
*  Otherwise, this is going to happen for the rest of time. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2825.92s)]
*  Yeah, we always have to look at levers of power and counter power and ways to [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2844.48s)]
*  establish leverage over forces that are disenfranchising and exploiting so many people. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2853.2s)]
*  As we're looking at the insanity of these tariffs and the kind of volatility it's [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2861.36s)]
*  presenting to so many people's lives, including people's 401Ks. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2868.16s)]
*  It's a reminder of an era that Trump worships that he discusses now. He didn't discuss it [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2872.3199999999997s)]
*  as much back in the 2016 days, but he did talk about tariffs, which is the Gilded Age, right? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2878.16s)]
*  And so sometimes I'm doing nice fun things in the evening to kind of lift my spirits, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2883.36s)]
*  but sometimes I'm doing things like watching documentaries about the Gilded Age. Don't ask me [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2888.0s)]
*  why, but that's me, a glutton. So what's very notable about the Gilded Age is it was [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2892.08s)]
*  a few robber barons that were able to exploit the technologies of that time to reap and gain [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2901.84s)]
*  all the benefits while obviously disenfranchising and screwing over workers and the wider public, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2909.12s)]
*  right? And so I think that is uncannily similar to what is occurring now. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2915.84s)]
*  And as you mentioned, Cenk, it's about taking all the profit and making all the money. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2921.2s)]
*  In particular case of today, when it comes to tech and kind of the doging of our lives, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2926.4s)]
*  and all this doge stuff, it's actually not even always about profit. It's sort of more of a feudal [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2930.8799999999997s)]
*  system. And it's a system of amassing massive, massive valuations, right? A company like Amazon, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2937.8399999999997s)]
*  for example, was not profitable for the first decade or so of its existence. Uber wasn't either. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2944.64s)]
*  But in the meantime, they knocked out all worker organizing, knocked out all the competition, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2949.52s)]
*  essentially became close to de facto monopolies, and then basically could do whatever they wanted [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2954.4s)]
*  at that point, including hijacking markets and so on. So it's a reminder, this story and Bill Burr's [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2959.92s)]
*  warnings that greed begets greed, as we've talked about before. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2971.28s)]
*  Or even a reminder of Gordon Gekko, if you all remember Wall Street, greed is good. Somehow, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2975.2s)]
*  there is this sort of vision that is out there. But what the vision is of an economic future for [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2981.2s)]
*  this country and this planet is completely under articulated. And we need a progressive [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2988.7999999999997s)]
*  response that discusses what our vision is of an economic future. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2993.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Do we have time to play one more video or do we think we should? Yeah, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=2998.64s)]
*  I think we can do just a little bit more. It's good stuff. Listen to this on corporate greed. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3002.7999999999997s)]
*  Sure. Eventually, these corporations just got sick of dealing with these unions. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3005.9199999999996s)]
*  And they're hard nosed negotiating all that. And then they just said, well, you then, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3012.8799999999997s)]
*  keep your union, keep your factory, we're leaving. And they took their factories outside of the US [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3017.8399999999997s)]
*  and went back to 1800 wages. What the you should be making those things here. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3024.32s)]
*  And then what the corporate guy said was, well, we would make sneakers here. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3030.0s)]
*  But to pay the American worker and everything, the sneakers would then instead of costing 50 bucks, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3035.04s)]
*  they now cost 700. And I was always thinking, why? It would cost 700, but I can't afford that. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3040.6400000000003s)]
*  And what it really was, was they weren't gonna lose the profit of sweatshop labor. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3050.3199999999997s)]
*  So if they came back to America, we weren't gonna work for that. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3055.2799999999997s)]
*  So and they weren't gonna lose the profit of sweatshop labor. So they were gonna pass it [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3060.08s)]
*  on to the consumer. Yeah, that was the argument. We hear sort of updated versions of that now. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3064.88s)]
*  Cenk, any quick thoughts about that? Yeah, they always have an excuse for [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3071.52s)]
*  getting more and more profits from us. We'll hold all your prices hostage, and we'll do this and [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3076.5600000000004s)]
*  that. So each industry is different, and we might have lost some industries. I understand that, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3083.0400000000004s)]
*  right? But there's a lot of industries we could have protected. And more important than anything [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3088.0s)]
*  else, look guys, our government was supposed to be a democracy. I wrote about this in Justice Coming [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3093.0400000000004s)]
*  2. And our founding fathers warned us about corporations. They partly did the American [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3098.88s)]
*  Revolution against the British East India Company. The Tea Party, where they threw the tea overboard, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3105.76s)]
*  was against that corporation, not against the British Empire, okay? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3112.2400000000002s)]
*  And they heavily, heavily warned, and I've got some of the quotes in the book, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3117.36s)]
*  do not let corporations take over. And we didn't listen. And slowly they took over. And now we're [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3121.12s)]
*  at a point where they threaten us every once in a while. You don't listen to us. You'll have to pay [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3128.56s)]
*  $700 for your sneakers, okay? And you know what? We're gonna use your children. We're gonna put [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3132.64s)]
*  them, and you know that law in Florida that isn't just like, go have me a summer job at Burger King. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3137.12s)]
*  No, it's to let kids work the overnight shift during school days. I mean, it is exploitation [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3142.48s)]
*  on steroids because our government doesn't work for us. That's what populism is saying, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3152.64s)]
*  get the government to work for the people again. Turn it back into a democracy and not have it [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3160.7999999999997s)]
*  serve the donor class and corporate rule. And so that's basically what Bill Burr is pointing out [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3166.7999999999997s)]
*  there. He's absolutely right. One of our members wrote in, everybody's asking for Joe Rogan of the [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3172.32s)]
*  left. I mean, Bill Burr is amazing. And it isn't about left or right. It's common sense and it's [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3177.36s)]
*  fighting for the average guy. I mean, so my last point to you guys is, do not let corporate media [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3184.1600000000003s)]
*  brainwash you into believing any of this corporate propaganda. They do not have to rule us. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3193.36s)]
*  And we don't have to pay their ransom. We can actually take our government back [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3200.2400000000002s)]
*  and reset it to serve us rather than them. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3204.88s)]
*  All right, we're out of time for the first hour. We got an important second hour. They have now [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3207.92s)]
*  detained some US citizens. And who's they? ICE. Why is ICE, immigration, detaining US citizens? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3219.52s)]
*  Well, that's a hell of a question. So we'll try to answer when we come back. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meEDLtxKS2w&t=3226.16s)]
