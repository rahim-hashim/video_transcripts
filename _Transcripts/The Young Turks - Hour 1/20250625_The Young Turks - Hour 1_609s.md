"A senior Justice Department official, Emil Bove III, told subordinates he was willing to ignore court orders to fulfill the president‚Äôs aggressive deportation campaign, according to a whistle-blower complaint by a department lawyer who has since been fired.
The account by the dismissed lawyer, Erez Reuveni, paints a disturbing portrait of his final three weeks on the front lines of the Trump administration‚Äôs legal efforts to ship immigrants overseas, often with little notice or recourse. In Mr. Reuveni‚Äôs telling, Mr. Bove discussed disregarding court orders, adding an expletive for emphasis, and other top law enforcement officials showed themselves ready to stonewall judges or lie to them to get their way."

# WHISTLEBLOWER Reveals That Trump Admin Is Ignoring Court Orders
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk)
*  Bro, these ice rays are nuts, man. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=0.0s)]
*  Watching this protest on television, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  it's like- [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=4.94s)]
*  The raids are nuts, the protest, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  the protests. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=7.4s)]
*  All of it's nuts. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=8.24s)]
*  I think both sides are taking it [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=9.24s)]
*  a little too hard. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=10.44s)]
*  Well, I don't think if the Trump [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=11.56s)]
*  administration, if they're running [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=13.56s)]
*  and they said we're going to go to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=15.84s)]
*  Home Depot, and we're going to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=17.72s)]
*  arrest all the people at Home Depot, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  we're going to go to construction [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=21.36s)]
*  sites and we're going to just [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=23.12s)]
*  tackle people at construction sites. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=24.8s)]
*  I don't think anybody was signed [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=27.0s)]
*  up for that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  Gang members first. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=29.2s)]
*  Well, not only is the Trump [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=32.36s)]
*  administration doing the opposite [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=33.9s)]
*  of what they promised, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=36.04s)]
*  they are not only focusing on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=37.36s)]
*  criminals and gang members. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=39.0s)]
*  They are in fact doing ice raids at [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=41.12s)]
*  Home Depot parking lots at [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=43.04s)]
*  the direction of Stephen Miller, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=44.56s)]
*  who wants to increase the number of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  people getting deported. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=48.32s)]
*  You also have a whistleblower who's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=49.76s)]
*  now coming out and sharing that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=52.16s)]
*  Trump's own Justice Department is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=54.4s)]
*  making, he was in Trump's Justice [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=57.76s)]
*  Department, but he's making [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=59.76s)]
*  the allegation that they were [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=61.56s)]
*  essentially told to ignore the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=63.32s)]
*  courts. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=65.16s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=66.6s)]
*  So let me give you all the details [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=67.24s)]
*  on this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=68.8s)]
*  So again, this is a whistleblower [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=69.72s)]
*  at Trump's own Justice Department [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=71.44s)]
*  making the stunning allegation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=73.16s)]
*  The whistleblower's name is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=74.6s)]
*  Erez Rouveni. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=76.56s)]
*  Now he is the Trump administration [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=77.88s)]
*  lawyer specifically who admitted [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=80.68s)]
*  that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=83.6s)]
*  deported mistakenly. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  Now according to Rouveni, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  Principal Associate Deputy Attorney [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=90.16s)]
*  General Emil Bove said the Trump [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  administration's deportations [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=95.44s)]
*  should be carried out regardless of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=97.96s)]
*  any court orders preventing them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  That's a pretty big revelation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  And I'm not okay with that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=107.52s)]
*  We have a system of checks and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  balances. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  Even if the executive branch [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=113.44s)]
*  doesn't like a ruling from [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=115.2s)]
*  our judicial branch, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=117.0s)]
*  if you believe in our constitution, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=118.32s)]
*  if you believe in our system of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  government, you must abide by that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=122.28s)]
*  decision or appeal it and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=124.36s)]
*  go through the process. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=125.8s)]
*  But according to Rouveni, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=127.24s)]
*  that is not what the direction was. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=129.24s)]
*  So in March, Bove allegedly stated [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=132.2s)]
*  in a meeting that the Trump [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=134.24s)]
*  administration was about to carry [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=135.76s)]
*  out deportations under the Alien [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=137.84s)]
*  Enemies Act. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=139.92s)]
*  Bove indicated these removals were [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=141.0s)]
*  a priority for the administration [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=143.32s)]
*  and stressed to all in attendance [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=145.92s)]
*  that the planes needed to take off [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=148.8s)]
*  no matter what. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=151.56s)]
*  And indeed, we had shared a story [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=154.04s)]
*  with you indicating that after [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=156.32s)]
*  a federal judge had told the Trump [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=158.56s)]
*  administration that they are not to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=161.0s)]
*  send a flight of immigrants to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=163.68s)]
*  El Salvador, they did it anyway. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=166.0s)]
*  Too late, they're in midair, sorry. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=168.56s)]
*  So just totally ignoring what our [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  judicial branch is ordering the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=174.68s)]
*  executive branch to do in that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  case. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  Now, and if a court order were to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=179.84s)]
*  try and stop the deportations, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=182.24s)]
*  Bove stated that the DOJ would need [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  to consider telling the courts FU [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  and ignore any such court order. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  Now, Rouveni also stated that he [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=193.8s)]
*  was instructed by the Trump [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=195.96s)]
*  administration to refer to Kilmar [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=197.68s)]
*  Abrego Garcia as a terrorist. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=200.04s)]
*  But he refused to do so because he [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=203.32s)]
*  was not aware of any evidence [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=205.32s)]
*  indicating that Abrego Garcia was [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=207.12s)]
*  a terrorist. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=209.24s)]
*  There was nothing to back up that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=210.72s)]
*  claim, so he refused to do it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=212.36s)]
*  Now, the Trump administration denies [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=214.12s)]
*  Rouveni's allegations. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=216.28s)]
*  But interestingly enough, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=217.88s)]
*  Bove was at a House hearing today [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=220.08s)]
*  and you're about to watch Senator [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=222.36s)]
*  Adam Schiff ask some important [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=224.76s)]
*  questions. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=227.0s)]
*  Let's see what Bove had to say. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=227.72s)]
*  Senator, I have no recollection of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=229.72s)]
*  saying anything of that kind. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=231.28s)]
*  To the extent I usually- [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=232.56s)]
*  Don't you recall, Mr. Bove, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  if you said or suggested during [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=235.2s)]
*  a meeting with Justice Department [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=236.84s)]
*  lawyers that maybe they should [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=238.56s)]
*  consider telling the court? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=240.04s)]
*  It seems to me that would be [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=241.6s)]
*  something you'd remember unless [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=243.12s)]
*  that's the kind of thing you say [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  frequently. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=246.39999999999998s)]

*  to Abrego Garcia. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7SIz7Safk&t=358.92s)]
