"Border czar Tom Homan called for a Justice Department investigation into a CNN segment reporting on an app that tracks ICE ‚Äî apparently under the mistaken assumption that the cable news network itself is tracking law enforcement agents.
‚ÄúCNN is pushing an app to track ICE agents to help criminal aliens evade being detained,‚Äù pro-Trump commentator Benny Johnson said during an interview with Homan on his podcast Monday."

# THE TRUMP ADMIN IS OUT OF CONTROL
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ)
*  Turns out right now that CNN is pushing an app to track ICE agents to help criminal aliens evade [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  being detained. We have the article up right here along with the clip. What's your response to CNN? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=8.64s)]
*  It's disgusting. I mean, this is horrendous that a national media outlet will be out there trying [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=13.76s)]
*  to forecast law enforcement operations throughout the country. I mean, it's incredible where we're [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  as a nation and I think DOJ needs to look at this and see if they're crossing that line. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=25.52s)]
*  CNN merely reported on the existence of said app, but you have two people that you just heard from. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=30.08s)]
*  I don't know if there are two brain cells among the two of them to rub together, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=44.96s)]
*  but they are under the impression, allegedly, I don't even know if they actually believe this, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=50.16s)]
*  that CNN is promoting an app that alerts individuals about ICE raids and ICE activity, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  which would put ICE agents in threat, right, at risk. That's what they're claiming here, okay? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=64.0s)]
*  So I'm just going to jump in for a second. I thought in the beginning when I saw the headlines [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=70.08s)]
*  that CNN had come up with the app. I was a little surprised by it, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=74.8s)]
*  No, they just reported on it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  No, no, I know. And so then, but even then I was like, okay, this is like the guy who's trying to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=80.16s)]
*  Elon Musk flight. It makes me a little uncomfortable, but they're certainly allowed to do it, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=85.84s)]
*  But then when you find out CNN just reported on some dude's app, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=90.64s)]
*  are we not allowed to report on any apps? Or is it just like, I need to know what the standard is, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=96.16s)]
*  if it hurts the feelings of Donald Trump or, I mean, this is just ludicrous and they're talking [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=102.24s)]
*  about arresting people at CNN. Are you out of your freaking mind? All right, now the rest is. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=107.2s)]
*  All right, well, I guess we're gonna put ourselves in a little bit of danger [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=113.44s)]
*  in the Trump administration's crosshairs because this app, which is known as Ice Block, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  was developed by a tech innovator by the name of Joshua Aaron in response to the Trump [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=122.8s)]
*  administration's ramped up ICE raids and deportations. But CNN, again, is not [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=128.96s)]
*  advertising the app, okay? They're not promoting it. They're not the people behind the app. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=136.08s)]
*  They merely reported on it. In fact, here's part of the segment in question. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  One tech developer is pushing back with an app designed to track ICE activity in real time. It's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=145.84s)]
*  called Ice Block and it's controversial to say the least. I talked with Joshua Aaron, who was [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=153.12s)]
*  the longtime tech worker who developed this platform, and he said he really wants it to be [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=157.68s)]
*  an early warning system for people about the location of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=162.08s)]
*  officers. So he says he does not want people interfering with those officers' activity, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=166.96s)]
*  but he does want people to be able to avoid them altogether if they want. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=172.8s)]
*  So you open the app, it looks like a map, and users can tap the map to report an ICE sighting [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=176.24s)]
*  in their area. And then everybody who uses the platform within five miles of that sighting will [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=181.84s)]
*  get a push alert. And in a corresponding CNN article, their tech reporter writes, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=186.4s)]
*  Aaron, meaning the man behind this actual app, said he hopes those notifications will help people [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  avoid interactions with ICE, avoid interactions with ICE, noting that he does not want users to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=201.44s)]
*  interfere with the agency's operations. The app provides a similar warning when users [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=208.24s)]
*  log a sighting. Please note that the use of this app is for information and notification [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=213.44s)]
*  purposes only. It is not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  with law enforcement. Nonetheless, Homeland, HHS Secretary Christy Noem and Donald Trump have now [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=225.68s)]
*  joined Tom Homan's calls for CNN to be prosecuted. Take a look. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  CNN yesterday pushed an app that lets you track where ICE agents are. Tom Homan was saying that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=239.28s)]
*  perhaps CNN should be prosecuted for that, that's obstruction of law enforcement, your response. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=246.72s)]
*  Yeah, we're working with the Department of Justice to see if we can prosecute them for that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=251.76s)]
*  Because what they're doing is actively encouraging people to avoid law enforcement activities, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=255.2s)]
*  operations. And we're gonna actually go after them and prosecute them with the partnership [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  of Pam if we can because what they're doing we believe is illegal. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=266.88s)]
*  And it may be prosecuted also for having given false reports on the attack in Iran. So they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  may be very well prosecuted for that. What they did there we think is totally illegal. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  Anyone remember the whining about lawfare? What happened? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=281.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=288.48s)]
*  Now we're talking about prosecuting CNN for reporting about the existence of an app. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=288.8s)]
*  But because these dumbasses made this such a huge issue. Now, every press organization [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=295.2s)]
*  has talked about Trump threatening to arrest CNN for covering the app. And in doing so, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  everyone has covered the app. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=306.4s)]
*  100%, exactly. I didn't know about this app. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=308.0s)]
*  And by the way, you know who I found out about the app from? Christy Noem and Donald Trump. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=310.32s)]
*  That was the first story I saw. Arrest them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  I can't believe they're promoting an app like this. My gosh, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=316.0s)]
*  someone should look into prosecuting them. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=319.52s)]
*  Yeah, and CNN actually had a leak that was reported to them like every news organization [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=321.28s)]
*  for my entire lifetime. But that leak hurt Donald Trump's feelings about how what a nice military [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=327.68s)]
*  strike he had. So he was arrested and prosecuted for doing journalism. That's why he was in favor [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  of freedom of speech. So it looks like a little bit of cancel culture when you try to cancel anyone [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=342.24s)]
*  who reports on things. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=346.4s)]
*  No, by the way, the Iran strikes were beautiful. Perfectly done. Well done, President Trump. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=347.92s)]
*  You did it. You don't have to worry about Iran anymore. Please move on. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=353.04s)]
*  Yeah, I want him to move on. We cover that story and we said, hey, you know what? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  These leaks are meant to instigate more war. So policy wise, we agree with Donald Trump. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=363.44s)]
*  Should we arrest the reporters? Are you nuts? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=369.44s)]
*  I mean, in that case, maybe. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=372.56s)]
*  No. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=374.0s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=374.24s)]
*  Okay, and so look, CNN when they were reporting on it called it controversial. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=375.6s)]
*  And you can say, you know what? If you don't like the app, they outed the app, right? Earlier in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=380.48s)]
*  the show, we covered these despicable Israeli settlers murdering innocent Palestinians in the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=386.8s)]
*  West Bank. Does that mean that since we covered it, we're in favor of the Israeli settlers? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=391.36s)]
*  No, of course not. Just because CNN covered the app, does that mean that CNN is in favor of the app? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=398.16s)]
*  No, of course not. None of this makes any sense. And by the way, if you're a news organization- [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=404.16s)]
*  By the way, I'm in favor of the app. I'm in favor of the app. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=410.16s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what I'm gonna go to next. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=413.04s)]
*  I'm in favor of more information for people. You want to avoid ice raids? Great. I'm glad this [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=414.24s)]
*  app exists. What are you gonna do? Guys, in our GPSs now, it pops up to tell you that there's [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=419.44000000000005s)]
*  police nearby. So you slow down before the speed trap. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=426.32000000000005s)]
*  It's great. It's my favorite thing. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  That's standard in a lot of GPSs. Are you trying to tell them where the cops are? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=431.76s)]
*  You all need to be arrested with your stupid GPSs. I'm gonna put you all in alligator alcatraz. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=436.24s)]
*  Look, you sound like you lost your stupid mind, right? Whatever little you had of it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=441.36s)]
*  There's police stations all across the country. We all know where they are. They have addresses. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  You're telling people where the police are. Yeah, people need to know what their government does. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=450.24s)]
*  They need to know where the police station is. And so if ice is there and there's an app, so what? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=455.68s)]
*  Okay, I know, I know, but don't ever cross the government. The government will get you and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=460.32s)]
*  hunt you down. That is why we're so worried about the tyranny of government. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=466.64s)]
*  Now, Trump loves targeting the press. He has four personal lawsuits against media organizations, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=471.68s)]
*  including CBS, the Des Moines Register, Gannett, and also the Pulitzer Center. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  And yesterday Trump dropped the federal lawsuit against Iowa Polster and Seltzer [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  and the Des Moines Register only to refile in state court hours later. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vC-8sT4JpQ&t=495.44s)]
