# Trump Officials Continue Lying About Leaking Yemen War Plans
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8)
*  Can you share how your information about war plans against the Houthis in Yemen was shared [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=0.0s)]
*  with a journalist in the Atlantic? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=6.92s)]
*  And were those details classified? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=7.92s)]
*  So you're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who's made [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=8.92s)]
*  a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=20.52s)]
*  Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=24.28s)]
*  Well, there you have Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth outright lying about something that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=29.4s)]
*  broke yesterday. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=34.56s)]
*  Lying to the American people about the text message exchanges that were taking place among [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=36.6s)]
*  administration officials. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=42.08s)]
*  And the fact that Jeffrey Goldberg, an Atlantic journalist, was allegedly accidentally included [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=44.56s)]
*  in that exchange. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=50.459999999999994s)]
*  Now, this was on signal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=51.459999999999994s)]
*  It's the big story, it's the big scandal that will play out probably for the remainder of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  the week and then everyone will forget about it because there will be no consequences for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=57.36s)]
*  this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=60.36s)]
*  The Justice Department's not going to investigate it, but now you have Pete Hegseth saying it's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=61.36s)]
*  just a hoax, it's just a lie. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=65.4s)]
*  It's just so, can anybody just please just take personal responsibility. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=67.76s)]
*  It's not like you're going to face any consequences for it and let's move on. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=71.8s)]
*  But no, that's not going to happen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=74.92s)]
*  He's got to lie to us about it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=75.92s)]
*  So- [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=77.04s)]
*  Yeah, now he said there was no texting, but he didn't say there was no signal messaging. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=78.04s)]
*  Right, okay. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Very clever. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  So that'll be their fallback. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  Guys, Ana's right in that, yeah, Hegseth very clearly lied there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=91.84s)]
*  This is a giant national security screw up, but Hillary's emails got it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=92.84s)]
*  And we'll talk about the hypocrisy of it in a second. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  And I think that that's the most relevant part of this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  But what bothers me and frustrates me is that there's no consequences from the voters, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=103.56s)]
*  So- [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  Same, yeah, I agree. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, again, on both sides. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  But to be fair to the Democrats, now they're really mad at, a lot of Democratic voters [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=112.84s)]
*  are mad at Democratic leadership, Biden, etc., because they feel like they got lied to. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=117.2s)]
*  The Republicans, the accountability has been very, very, very slow. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=121.44s)]
*  So everybody admits this now, Trump admits this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=124.68s)]
*  But is anybody who's a Republican voter going to be upset at Hegseth for that obvious, outrageous [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  lie? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=132.44s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=133.44s)]
*  No. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=134.44s)]
*  Are they just as upset about this, which is a bigger problem than Hillary Clinton's emails [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=135.44s)]
*  in terms of the severity of those war plans, bombs, what we're gonna do, when we're gonna [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=140.18s)]
*  do it, who we're gonna do it to, etc. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=146.18s)]
*  That's as big a leak as it gets. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=148.74s)]
*  Are they going to be just as upset about this as they were about the Hillary emails? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=150.5s)]
*  You know the answer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=154.06s)]
*  Of course they're not, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=155.06s)]
*  And vice versa, etc. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=156.18s)]
*  So it's just the hypocrisy of both sides, but especially in this case, the right wing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=157.74s)]
*  is super frustrating. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  So more with that, Kim. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=164.7s)]
*  So for anyone who might have missed the hot story of the week, as we know, Jeffrey Goldberg [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=166.38s)]
*  of the Atlantic revealed just yesterday that the national security advisor, Michael Waltz, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=170.94s)]
*  had accidentally added him out of all the journalists in the country, accidentally added [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=176.94s)]
*  him to this signal group of administration officials who were talking about their plans [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=181.84s)]
*  in bombing the Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=189.18s)]
*  Now what was interesting about that exchange, by the way, was that there was some disagreement, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=192.58s)]
*  at least coming from the vice president, JD Vance, who felt that it was unnecessary to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=197.34s)]
*  carry out these strikes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=201.62s)]
*  But nonetheless, he kinda got slapped down by Stephen Miller, and obviously the attacks [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=203.06s)]
*  against the Houthis actually came to fruition. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=208.74s)]
*  Now Goldberg wrote that on Saturday, March 15th, at 1144 AM, the account labeled Pete [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=211.18s)]
*  Hegseth posted in signal a team update. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=216.8s)]
*  I will not quote from this update or from certain other subsequent texts. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=220.54s)]
*  The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=226.1s)]
*  States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=231.17999999999998s)]
*  particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this signal conversation, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=242.0s)]
*  is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=252.04s)]
*  And then just two hours after Goldberg had received the details of the attack, the US [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=259.08s)]
*  actually began launching a series of airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  Now the veracity of the group chat was confirmed even by the president himself, Donald Trump. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=269.08s)]
*  He seemingly admitted this mistake happened saying quote, Michael Walz has learned a lesson, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=275.58s)]
*  he's a good man. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=280.9s)]
*  Has he and is he? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=282.5s)]
*  What's the lesson? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=285.26s)]
*  This broke yesterday. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=286.46s)]
*  What was the lesson? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=288.06s)]
*  Did you give him a spanking? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=289.06s)]
*  What was the lesson? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=290.06s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=291.06s)]
*  No, again, the hypocrisy of both sides. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=292.06s)]
*  So both Mike Walz and Pete Hegseth are on the record as saying, any leaks like this is gross [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  incompetence and people need to be fired and their heads need to roll. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=301.18s)]
*  And of course, that's when they were talking about Democrats. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=306.1s)]
*  But when it's them, they're like, it's a big deal. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  Plus we didn't do it, plus we did, plus who cares? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=310.3s)]
*  Plus I'll do so what? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  So what? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=314.54s)]
*  I'll leak a top secret now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=315.54s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump took all the top secret information and put it in Amar Alago's bathroom. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=316.54s)]
*  So what? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=319.66s)]
*  So what? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=320.66s)]
*  Okay, but then don't talk to me about Hillary's emails from 200 years ago. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=321.66s)]
*  So we criticized Hillary's emails and then we thought it was a relatively small story. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=327.44s)]
*  But no, they won't ever let it go. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=334.36s)]
*  They're still talking about it today in this context. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=337.44s)]
*  And then when it happens to them, it's a big deal, man. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=340.04s)]
*  Yeah, so what? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=343.08s)]
*  Here's our new secret place. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=344.08s)]
*  So what? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=345.08s)]
*  So what? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=346.08s)]
*  Okay, I can't stand it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=347.08s)]
*  Just have a consistent standard and be upset in both directions or have the decency to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  shut up about it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=354.44s)]
*  Honestly, at this point, I think everyone should have the decency to shut up about it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=356.08s)]
*  Because look, each party, okay, puts their party, their tribe, and their own asses before [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=359.48s)]
*  the country and what's best for the country. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=366.32s)]
*  And so this dysfunctional politics means that nothing ever happens. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=368.84s)]
*  There will be a scandal, okay, this broke yesterday. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=372.18s)]
*  I already predicted what the talking points were gonna be from the Republicans and those [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=375.44s)]
*  talking points are now being doled out little by little. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=378.84s)]
*  Same lies, same nonsense. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=381.88s)]
*  If the shoe were on the other foot, I have no doubt that we would get similar cover stories [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=383.68s)]
*  for what happened, or at least a downplaying of the situation. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=387.8s)]
*  Neither party takes responsibility for their foibles, for their mistakes, for their scandals. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=391.88s)]
*  And so we're always caught up in the same situation again and again and again. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=396.14s)]
*  Nothing ever gets resolved, nothing ever gets fixed. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=400.3s)]
*  And can we talk about healthcare? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  Can we talk about actual policy that has a material impact on people's lives? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=403.48s)]
*  Otherwise, this is just a big waste of time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=408.36s)]
*  It's just gossip. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=410.56s)]
*  It's soap opera gossip story with one side in denial, the other side engaging in hyperbole. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=411.6s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=416.92s)]
*  And then we're gonna forget about it by next week and there's gonna be another scandal. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=417.92s)]
*  Congratulations, this is politics in America. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=420.32s)]
*  Yeah, so two more things about that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  So look, yesterday on the show, I said yes, but when you get the substance of it, people [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=424.64s)]
*  are also going, ha ha, JD Vance disagree with Donald Trump. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=429.16s)]
*  Which is great. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=431.88s)]
*  Yeah, I said- That's a good thing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=432.88s)]
*  But that's not a bad thing, yeah. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=433.88s)]
*  And in fact, JD Vance argued against the strikes. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=435.4s)]
*  And the strikes are aggressive and more pro-war. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=438.92s)]
*  And I gained a tiny bit of respect for JD Vance, having read those exchanges. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=442.0s)]
*  Hegseth wanted to be more pro-war and JD wants- [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  Because he's a neocon. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=449.28s)]
*  Yeah, because he is a neocon and JD Vance is a little bit less pro-war. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=450.28s)]
*  And at the end, he was like, Hegseth, Vance says to Hegseth, yeah, sure, go ahead. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=455.44s)]
*  I trust your judgment, bomb away, right? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=459.76s)]
*  But that kind of disagreement internally is not a ha ha. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=462.8s)]
*  That's actually the one positive that comes out of the story. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=466.48s)]
*  Secondly, look, their incompetence to me was baked in, right? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=469.12s)]
*  You hire a Rando Fox News weekend host as a secretary of defense, you're gonna get screw [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=473.44s)]
*  ups, right? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  You hire based on what Miriam Adelson told you to hire, based on whoever's the most pro-Israel, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=481.08000000000004s)]
*  that's Mike Walsh, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  You're gonna get some incompetence. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=487.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump is hiring and he's hiring based on loyalty rather than competence. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=489.16s)]
*  So of course, and then Elon Musk and all those guys going 100 miles per hour, breaking everything. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=493.42s)]
*  Later, we have a much more important story about how they're breaking social security, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=497.5s)]
*  right? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=501.21999999999997s)]
*  So those things are kind of baked in for me. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=502.21999999999997s)]
*  That's why I don't know if this opinion is controversial or not. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=505.34s)]
*  But I don't much care about this. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=508.5s)]
*  So okay, don't do it again. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=511.06s)]
*  Next time it might not be Jeffrey Goldberg, it might be something else. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=512.82s)]
*  But in my favorite moment out of all of these leaks and taking top secret documents home [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=515.98s)]
*  and etc. was when Bernie Sanders said in debate, when he was trying really, really hard to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=523.1s)]
*  win the presidency against Hillary Clinton. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=528.38s)]
*  And he said, I don't care about her damn emails. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=531.4200000000001s)]
*  See that's a guy who's consistent and principled. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=533.66s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's bad, but it's not the end of the world. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=536.14s)]
*  What's the end of the world is that we don't have paid family leaves and moms have to go [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=539.82s)]
*  in to work a day after they deliver. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=544.22s)]
*  It's insanity, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=546.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=547.34s)]
*  So we never get anything we want. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=548.34s)]
*  And then there's this giant kerfuffle and drama about this. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=549.82s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=552.66s)]
*  So the denials are pretty hilarious though, because it'd be one thing if this entire story [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=553.66s)]
*  was based on hearsay. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=561.02s)]
*  But Jeffrey Goldberg was part of the group as they were exchanging information about [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=563.18s)]
*  what they intended to do against the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=568.9399999999999s)]
*  He has the receipt, so the denials seem insane, even more insane than usual. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  Because all they ever do is lie. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=578.62s)]
*  That's what's so frustrating about politicians. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=580.3399999999999s)]
*  And look, they don't even need to, this is the thing. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=582.22s)]
*  They could just easily say, yeah, there was a mistake made. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=585.9s)]
*  We've learned from it, we're moving on, okay? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=589.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=591.26s)]
*  Because guess what? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=592.26s)]
*  You think the DOJ is gonna investigate them? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=593.26s)]
*  You think Pam Bondi, Attorney General Pam Bondi is like, I'm really concerned about [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=594.26s)]
*  this Pete Hegseth initiated group message that a journalist was allegedly accidentally [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=598.26s)]
*  included in. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=603.58s)]
*  Anyway, so let's get to the top intelligence officials who were pressed today on the leak [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=604.58s)]
*  during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=610.62s)]
*  So they refused to give any straight answers, including the DNI Director Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  who wouldn't even admit that she was on the text group at all. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=618.1s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=622.1800000000001s)]
*  Director Gabbard, did you participate in the group chat with Secretary of Defense and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=623.1800000000001s)]
*  other Trump senior officials discussing the Yemen war plans? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=627.4200000000001s)]
*  Senator, I don't wanna get into this- [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=631.62s)]
*  Ma'am, were you on? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=634.1s)]
*  You're not going to be willing to address it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=635.44s)]
*  So you're not, are you denying? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=636.44s)]
*  Matt, will you answer my question, ma'am? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=637.44s)]
*  You are not TG on this group chat. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=638.6s)]
*  I'm not gonna get into the specifics of the delivery- [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=645.24s)]
*  So you refuse to acknowledge whether you are on this group chat? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=646.24s)]
*  Senator, I'm not going to get into the specifics- [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  Why are you gonna get into the specifics? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=652.32s)]
*  Is it because it's all classified? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=654.6800000000001s)]
*  Because this is currently under review by the National Security Council. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=656.48s)]
*  Because it's all classified? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=659.44s)]
*  If it's not classified, share the text now. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=660.44s)]
*  As the White House previously stated- [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=665.34s)]
*  Is it classified or non-classified information on this text? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=666.38s)]
*  She was on the group text, okay? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=669.98s)]
*  She was in the group chat, she was included. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=671.98s)]
*  I don't know why she couldn't just say yes, but she had that embarrassing moment where [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=673.9s)]
*  she refused to just answer that simple question. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=677.3000000000001s)]
*  You also have CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who was also in that chat group. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=680.5400000000001s)]
*  He claims that he didn't even know how Goldberg was added to the group. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=686.82s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=690.02s)]
*  You are the CIA director, okay? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=691.02s)]
*  This has happened. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=693.4200000000001s)]
*  We know it's happened. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=695.4s)]
*  Did Jeff Goldberg, somehow, did he create a hoax that allowed him to become part of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=697.64s)]
*  this signal thread? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=705.28s)]
*  Please answer the question. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=706.68s)]
*  Don't insult the intelligence of the American people. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  Did he invite himself to the signal thread? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=715.16s)]
*  I don't know how he was invited, but clearly he was added. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=719.48s)]
*  Clearly it was. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=724.44s)]
*  Finish your sentence, please. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=725.8800000000001s)]
*  Clearly he was added to the signal group. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=728.84s)]
*  Your question is- [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=732.0400000000001s)]
*  So you don't know that the president's national security advisor invited him to join the signal [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=733.0400000000001s)]
*  thread? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=741.8000000000001s)]
*  Everybody in America knows that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  Does the CIA director not know that? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  I've seen conflicting reports about who added the reporter to the signal messaging group. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=746.36s)]
*  Okay, I'm bored. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=754.28s)]
*  I'm super bored. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=756.08s)]
*  It's just real great. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=757.08s)]
*  That part was funny though. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=758.08s)]
*  He's the head of the CIA, Central Intelligence Agency. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=759.08s)]
*  He's super intelligent. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=762.08s)]
*  He didn't even notice that there's a reporter in this top secret chat group. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=763.08s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=769.08s)]
*  Not the best spy in the world for the guy who's supposed to be the head of our spies. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=771.08s)]
*  I gotta say, Cenk- [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=776.08s)]
*  Maybe Jeffrey Goldberg should be added to the CIA. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=777.08s)]
*  There's gotta be something else to the story. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=780.08s)]
*  There's gotta be something more. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=782.2800000000001s)]
*  This is the point where we're done with the facts of the story as we know them. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=783.2800000000001s)]
*  This is where I jump into my own personal speculation on this. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=788.2800000000001s)]
*  At some point in that text exchange, Jeffrey Goldberg left the conversation. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=792.2800000000001s)]
*  When you leave the conversation, everyone in the group is alerted that someone has left [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=798.2800000000001s)]
*  the conversation. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=802.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so there was only two people with initials. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=803.2800000000001s)]
*  So one was SM, which people believe is Stephen Miller. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=806.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=809.2800000000001s)]
*  The other one was Goldberg, JG, right? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=810.48s)]
*  So my best guess, and I have no idea, is that Mike Waltz thought that JG was another JG. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=813.48s)]
*  I don't know if he knows another Jeffrey Goldberg or just another JG, right? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=821.48s)]
*  And so when JG left the group, even all the people on there, but it is funny. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=825.48s)]
*  I mean, the director of national intelligence decided the CIA. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=831.48s)]
*  And they're like, JG, huh? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=834.48s)]
*  Do I know a JG in the White House? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=837.48s)]
*  They don't even notice. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=839.6800000000001s)]
*  It is weird, though. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=841.6800000000001s)]
*  Two weeks prior to this group chat thing happening, I read that Waltz reached out and requested [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  to connect with Jeffrey Goldberg via signal. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=857.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's the other funny part of it. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=858.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the same thing. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=859.6800000000001s)]
*  And so they leak like a sieve, right? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=861.6800000000001s)]
*  So these guys that all talk about the fake news and how they're the worst and stuff, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  they're leaking to the reporters all the time. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=867.88s)]
*  Is there a possibility? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=870.88s)]
*  I have no evidence of this. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=872.88s)]
*  Again, this is speculation. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=873.88s)]
*  We're having fun, because there's just something that doesn't add up for me, okay? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=874.88s)]
*  There's a feeling in the pit of my stomach. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=878.88s)]
*  Is there a possibility that someone's trying to throw JD Vance under the bus within the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=880.88s)]
*  administration? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=886.88s)]
*  Yeah, but this would be a curious way of doing it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=887.88s)]
*  So look, a lot of speculation. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=890.88s)]
*  It's hard to tell. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=892.88s)]
*  It's hard to tell. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=893.88s)]
*  My best guess is just normal incompetence from a group that is not known for their competence. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=895.24s)]
*  No, no, and I'm willing to believe that. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=900.88s)]
*  It's just that out of all the journalists in the country, Jeffrey Goldberg of all people, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=902.64s)]
*  who is known to publish the most anti-Trump pieces, who is known to be a stenographer [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=908.2s)]
*  for the intelligence community and just regurgitate pro-war talking points that the intelligence [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=914.08s)]
*  community wants out there. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=919.5s)]
*  I don't know, there's just something about this story that I find fishy, something that's [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=921.0799999999999s)]
*  missing from it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=925.88s)]
*  I could be totally wrong. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=927.24s)]
*  I'd be happy to be proven totally wrong. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=928.68s)]
*  So we're not gonna find out until this story develops further. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=930.4799999999999s)]
*  I don't think we're ever gonna find out. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=932.9599999999999s)]
*  So why did he add him in the first place is a good question. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=935.24s)]
*  But so guys, when we cover news stories, we show you, people will read it and say, that's [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=939.8399999999999s)]
*  the truth. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=946.3199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=947.3199999999999s)]
*  The people who leak to the reporter will get written up favorably in that story. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=949.04s)]
*  But they never tell you that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=954.76s)]
*  That's the implicit deal that they do with government officials and politicians. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=956.52s)]
*  You give me something and then I paint it as if you're the hero and the other person [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=960.86s)]
*  is the bad guy, right? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=964.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's why they leak to the reporters. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=966.1999999999999s)]
*  And so does Jeffrey Goldberg do that with some of the people in the Trump administration? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=968.52s)]
*  Does Maggie Haberman do the other reporters? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=975.56s)]
*  Yesterday I had Michael LaRosa on the show, sorry, he's an insider in the Biden administration [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=978.48s)]
*  was ex press secretary for Dr. Jill Biden, right? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=988.28s)]
*  And he explained that the Biden team, for example, would often do something they're [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=992.0799999999999s)]
*  not supposed to do at all. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=996.6999999999999s)]
*  And then we saw them doing it when Biden got caught after the debate when he was doing [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=997.88s)]
*  some interviews. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1003.48s)]
*  They would often just script out the questions for reporters and hand it to them. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1004.62s)]
*  And then he said on top of that, they get to review the quotes. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1009.1s)]
*  And they could kill any quote they wanted in the story and only put the quotes in that [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1014.72s)]
*  was favorable to Biden. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1019.3s)]
*  These are things that the reporters don't ever tell you, right? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1020.8s)]
*  But those are all the different ways they manipulate the story to help their sources. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1023.98s)]
*  So then you're not really getting the news. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1028.18s)]
*  I know, but look, it's okay when a Democratic administration tries to control journalists [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1030.3799999999999s)]
*  and the media. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1037.3s)]
*  Yeah, but not when the Republicans do, or vice versa. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1038.3s)]
*  Or could it be that it's awful when anyone in government tries to control journalists [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1040.6599999999999s)]
*  or prevent them from doing their jobs effectively? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1046.3s)]
*  Yeah, of course, of course. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1048.8999999999999s)]
*  So anyway. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1051.52s)]
*  And last thing on that, so look, they're lying through their teeth on this story, etc. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1052.52s)]
*  But Joe Biden by doing the big lie of no, he's not in mental decline. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1057.62s)]
*  And Browby as LaRosa explained last night, and check out that interview on YouTube, it's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1065.06s)]
*  really good. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1068.9399999999998s)]
*  They intimidated and bullied the press over and over and over again, right? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1069.9399999999998s)]
*  And they said, you better report that Joe Biden is young and he's in great shape and [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1075.82s)]
*  all that stuff, right? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1079.58s)]
*  So when they do that big lie, now their Democratic polling is at 27%, another story we're gonna [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1081.3s)]
*  get to later in the show. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1088.4199999999998s)]
*  So then they lose the right to complain about the onslaught, the tsunami of lies that the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1090.1399999999999s)]
*  Trump administration has. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1095.8999999999999s)]
*  That's why it's so important to hold your own side accountable. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1097.86s)]
*  Otherwise you lose the credibility to hold the other side accountable. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1101.54s)]
*  And finally, despite repeatedly claiming that there was absolutely no classified intelligence [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1105.86s)]
*  in that chat, the one admission that Tulsi Gabbard was forced to make is that they did [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1110.16s)]
*  discuss one thing that seems pretty damn sensitive. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1116.88s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1120.08s)]
*  In this signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1121.08s)]
*  Yemen? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1127.52s)]
*  I don't remember mention of specific targets. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1128.52s)]
*  Any generic target? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1131.92s)]
*  I believe there was discussion around targets in general. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1139.72s)]
*  Look, I just think if you're curious what the administration is cooking up in regard [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1145.28s)]
*  to foreign policy, all you need to do is check in with Israeli media. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1149.8s)]
*  Whatever Israeli media is reporting that the Israeli government wants, the United States [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1154.24s)]
*  government is gonna carry out. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1158.3400000000001s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1159.64s)]
*  We didn't need anything to be leaked for us to know about this. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1160.64s)]
*  Let's just be clear about that, okay? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1162.76s)]
*  Israel would want us to attack the Houthis. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1165.5600000000002s)]
*  We're gonna attack the Houthis. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1167.5s)]
*  Israel wants us to potentially engage in a hot war with Iran by first blowing up their [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1168.76s)]
*  nuclear sites. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1174.2s)]
*  We're gonna do it. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1175.2s)]
*  We're gonna do it. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1176.2s)]
*  The question is when, which day are we gonna do it? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1177.2s)]
*  Yeah, and look- It's that simple. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1179.8799999999999s)]
*  And by the way, I don't know what Goldberg hid and what he didn't because he only reported [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1182.32s)]
*  some of it, right? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1185.52s)]
*  So but in terms of the Houthis, it was also interesting to see the behind the scenes chat [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1186.8799999999999s)]
*  because JD Vanson was making the argument, well, have we really prepared the American [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1194.04s)]
*  people well enough for them to understand why we have to hit the Houthis? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1198.8s)]
*  And this is really helping Europe more than anyone else. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1203.68s)]
*  And do we really wanna help Europe? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1206.52s)]
*  So do we really wanna help Europe is bad from JD Vanson. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1208.1s)]
*  What a weird thing. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1211.2s)]
*  He's like the problem is he's like 3% of our trade goes through there, but 40% of Europe's [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1212.2s)]
*  does. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1216.04s)]
*  Why are we bothering to help Europe was one of his arguments, which is not the one I'm [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1217.04s)]
*  in favor of. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1221.1599999999999s)]
*  And then, but I was like, you really think you had to prepare the American people for [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9DFunosaa8&t=1222.44s)]
