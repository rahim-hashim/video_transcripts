"Democratic leaders on Wednesday condemned comments made by Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) describing fellow lawmakers in Congress as ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù while mocking their Muslim faith.
‚ÄúThe unhinged, racist and Islamophobic comments made by Randy Fine about Rep. Ilhan Omar are bigoted and disgusting. We are just weeks removed from heinous acts of political violence targeting elected officials in Minnesota for assassination,‚Äù House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (Calif.) said in a Wednesday release."

# Republican Rep Makes DISGUSTING Comment About Muslims
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA)
*  Congresswoman Ilhan Omar calling out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=0.0s)]
*  he shouldn't be welcomed in DC because in her words quote, war criminals should not be welcomed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=5.92s)]
*  by any president or Congress. I mean, he is an accused war criminal. That comment though [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=10.48s)]
*  sparked a barrage of attacks online. One in particular though from Florida Republican [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=16.48s)]
*  Randy Fine went beyond politics. Take a look at his response here. Not too low. I think he can go [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=21.68s)]
*  lower. He basically says, I'm sure it's difficult to see us welcome the killer of so many of your [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=30.96s)]
*  fellow Muslim terrorists. The only shame is that you serve in Congress. I know that everything [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  swirling around us in politics seems just rock bottom. But what's your initial reaction [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=45.04s)]
*  to this? I hate that this seems so normalized with some of these haters. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=52.08s)]
*  Yeah, so Randy Fine is a well-known bigot. Everybody knows he's like a deranged anti-Muslim [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=56.64s)]
*  bigot racist, right? And even in a Congress filled with anti-Muslim bigots, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=65.52s)]
*  filled with congressmen funding the genocide of Muslims in Gaza with glee, right? Randy Fine [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  stands out as the worst of the worst. So to me, that's not the issue. I already knew what kind of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=79.2s)]
*  a monster he is, right? But what's amazing, Sharon, is the juxtaposition. Because Ilhan Omar was [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=86.0s)]
*  censured for saying it's all about the Benjamins, about lobbyists, which is only 100% true. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=94.48s)]
*  The politicians do care about the money that the lobbyists are giving them. That's a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=103.12s)]
*  stone cold fact. And she was censured for that. How dare you? And that was somehow anti-Semitic. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=107.36s)]
*  Because they stretched it to, she's criticizing AIPAC and talking about money. And so that must [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=114.16s)]
*  mean Jews. Now wait, AIPAC's about Israel, it's not about Jews and money. You're making a weirdo [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=120.24s)]
*  assumption that anyone who measures money must mean that they're anti-Semitic. What? What's in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=125.6s)]
*  your head, right? Anyway, she makes a perfectly benign comment, censure, censure! Republicans and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=130.56s)]
*  Democrats. Randy Fine's like, yeah, the Muslim over there is a terrorist like all Muslims. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  And they're like, I don't see a problem. Where's the censure? Nobody's even talking about a censure. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Certainly the Republicans aren't obviously, but Democrats, where are you? You gotta protect [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=150.0s)]
*  your fellow Democrat? Unity, unity, right? Nothing, nothing, nothing. Because it's no big deal to be [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=153.84s)]
*  anti-Muslim in this country. Now, if you criticize Israel though, anti-Semites, anti-Semites. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=159.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, tell me that you take millions of dollars from AIPAC [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=169.12s)]
*  without telling me. Okay, so that's almost all of Congress. The problem isn't Randy Fine, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=174.0s)]
*  this jerk, bigot, losers like him. Plenty of folks in every country like that, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=178.48s)]
*  It's the people who financed him, put him in that position to be that deeply racist against Muslims. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  And bigoted, take any word you like in that. And it's his colleagues who are like, oh yeah, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  Randy Fine, Adam Boyd, Juicy, oh my God, Ilhan Omar said something against our beloved AIPAC. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  The lobbyists that have given us the most money in Congress in this election cycle than any other [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=203.12s)]
*  lobbyist, censure her, censure her. You guys like a foaming at the mouth, racist against [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=207.52s)]
*  Palestinians, bigoted against Muslims. And they're like, no big deal, no big deal. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=213.68s)]
*  So don't talk to me about bigotry. So no, no, no, anyone who doesn't think that Randy Fine [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=218.24s)]
*  shouldn't be censured, tall glass of shut up juice next time you talk about anti-Semitism [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=222.8s)]
*  when someone criticizes Israel, okay? Don't tell me that you care about bigotry, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=228.88s)]
*  but only bigotry against one group. And then you love the bigotry against another group. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=233.44s)]
*  So they don't care about bigotry. All of this giant entire exercise of Congress [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=239.6s)]
*  is to protect a foreign country, Israel. That's why when there's a verified, bona fide, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=247.04s)]
*  100% bigot like Randy Fine, they don't care at all. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=253.84s)]
*  Indifference, he's there because the voters put him there. So I think you're so right about that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=258.0s)]
*  spot on. This is not just a slur, of course, it's a sitting congressman accusing a Muslim colleague [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=268.16s)]
*  of being a terrorist solely based on her faith. Not the first time either, just last week, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=272.4s)]
*  Randy Fine in one of his latest episodes posted this under a photo of Rashida Tlaib and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=278.08s)]
*  Mondani, New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  He wrote, Muslim terrorists hang out together. And I bet you he just chuckled and those who [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=287.84s)]
*  believe what he believes just thought that was the funniest thing ever. Here's the thing, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=293.28s)]
*  he's not just saying the quiet part out loud. He's broadcasting it again and again to Jenks [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=300.32s)]
*  point where it's just accepted. It's accepted, it's normalized. Be clear, this is not some random [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=306.32s)]
*  troll. Randy Fine chairs the Florida House Committee on school safety and security. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=312.0s)]
*  He's been amplified by right wing media. He's already under fire for promoting [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=316.56s)]
*  anti-Palestinian rhetoric. He's called Gaza a quote terrorist state. He supported defunding [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=321.04s)]
*  universities that host pro-Palestine protests, repeatedly questioned the loyalty of Muslim [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=326.72s)]
*  Americans. The tweet posted on July 8th had over 789,000 views and that was just by this morning. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=332.72s)]
*  So what does this really say this moment, Cenk? And you've addressed the silence from GOP leaders, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=341.36s)]
*  but what does this say about, I guess, all of us? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=347.6s)]
*  Yeah, look, this has happened, of course, to many different groups in both American history and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=351.6s)]
*  obviously world history, where different groups are, we go through discriminating [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=359.36s)]
*  against different groups one at a time. So when the Italians, the immigrants were, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  and the Irish were the immigrants back in the day, made up names and all, they were different [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=368.88s)]
*  and they were terrible and they were Catholic and there was always a reason to hate, right? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=374.48s)]
*  And of course, perennially against black Americans, perennially against gay Americans, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=379.52s)]
*  etc. But the gay Americans, the trans Americans was a really interesting journey in a sense, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=384.08s)]
*  because Republicans start by saying, okay, gay marriage is terrible. These gay people live in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=388.4s)]
*  sin. We hate them, we hate them, we hate them. That stops working. Then they move to trans people, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=392.48s)]
*  that stops working. Then they start moving in, okay, all right, well, let's try trans bathroom [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=397.52s)]
*  military. Okay, no, that's not working. Let's go to sports. That worked, finally, okay, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  And so now in this case, there's no downside to attacking Muslims in this country. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=406.96s)]
*  And here's the thing, Sharon, and I'm sure that in a lot of ways you can relate to this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  When you're Muslim in America, you feel like you have no protection. So if somebody says [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=424.72s)]
*  something genuinely anti-Semitic like Grok did the other day or a hundred other people [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=430.32000000000005s)]
*  who are genuine anti-Semites and say terrible things, right? You're gonna get some protection, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=435.44000000000005s)]
*  and it makes sense, you should. And so what does that mean? That means people in media and politics [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=439.92s)]
*  will call it out and say that's wrong, and they'll protect that community. Wonderful, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  Wonderful, right? Now some communities have gotten strong enough in this country [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  where they can protect themselves and say, look, we're a huge part of the population. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  And you could do that for different groups, blacks, Latinos, Asians, et cetera, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=460.0s)]
*  in varying degrees, right? And certainly, my God, African Americans have been so vulnerable [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  for so long in this country, right? So but for now with Muslims, you could say anything you want. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=470.08s)]
*  I mean, you go on my ex account, you go anywhere, you go on this video, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=476.24s)]
*  and look at the comment section. There's dozens, hundreds of people like, you goddamn dirty Muslim, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  you should be arrested, exported, deported, expelled, et cetera. And you're a terrorist, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=486.88s)]
*  and you're this, and you're that, and nobody cares, nobody cares. I mean, even get past the randos. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=494.48s)]
*  Randy finds a congressman, no one cares. You could say what he said on TV, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=500.4s)]
*  they'll care for like half a second, they'll move on, right? So what do you do, right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=506.0s)]
*  Well, what you do is you try to get to a point, you join the perpetual civil rights movement that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  exists in this country, cuz after Muslims, it'll be somebody else, right? After we get accepted, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=522.4s)]
*  then they'll be like, it was the damn Peruvians, that was the real problem, right? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=527.92s)]
*  And they'll just keep trying to find another to attack, right? And that's representative [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=533.12s)]
*  Randy Fine in a nutshell. And so, but the second issue is, it's intertwined with this foreign policy [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=538.9599999999999s)]
*  issue. So as other lobbies, Big Pharma, Oil, etc., have cornered the market in Washington, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=547.68s)]
*  so has AIPAC, and AIPAC is to help a foreign country, Israel. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=556.48s)]
*  So, and even saying sentences like that out loud will get you attacked by mainstream media and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=561.12s)]
*  politicians and everyone in power. And so they have an incentive to get Americans to hate all [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=567.36s)]
*  Muslims. So when Israel attacks Muslim countries, as it does nonstop, right? Gaza, West Bank, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=578.4s)]
*  Lebanon, Syria, Iran, etc., they say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The Muslims are dirty, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=586.48s)]
*  terrorist savages, and they had it coming. You see, since they're the violent ones, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=592.64s)]
*  when Israel attacks them, when Israel bombs them, they're innocent. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=598.16s)]
*  And they're just doing self-defense, preemptively, preemptively. So, and of course, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=602.96s)]
*  that's a community you should hate. So when you combine the forces of looking for the next group [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=609.44s)]
*  to hate with this super powerful lobby that says, my God, it would help our interests so much [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=614.6400000000001s)]
*  if Americans hated Muslims. That is a lot of offense against us. And we have almost no defense, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  right? We have me and Mehdi Hassan and a bunch of other wonderful non-Muslim allies who fight back, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=629.44s)]
*  right? But in mainstream media, we're nearly non-existent. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=636.6400000000001s)]
*  And whenever a politician gets through, like Ilhan Omar or Rashida Tlaib, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=641.2s)]
*  all of American media and all the rest of their colleagues spend all their time trying to tear [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=645.9200000000001s)]
*  them down. So what do we do? We fight on, and we try to do the best we can. But right now, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=650.08s)]
*  so that's why, last thing on it, Sharon, and we have an interesting poll about this too. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  Here, let me tell you the poll and the last thing and then get your thoughts on it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=663.76s)]
*  On the website, we said, what do you think Democrats in Congress actually [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=666.48s)]
*  think of Representative Randy Fine's bigoted comments against Ilhan Omar? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=670.32s)]
*  Now, the question's about Democrats, not Republicans, right? Because he's a Republican, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=674.4s)]
*  the Republicans are gonna protect him. A, they're outraged and will call for the censure of [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=678.24s)]
*  Representative Fine. B, they'll do nothing cuz they're Democrats. C, they secretly agree [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=683.28s)]
*  with Representative Fine. D, they won't say anything cuz AIPAC would get mad at them. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=687.68s)]
*  So there's a lot of good answers in there, okay? So tyt.com, go vote, I'm curious what you guys [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=693.04s)]
*  think. But Sharon, when we go to defend ourselves, we get extra attacked, right? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=699.12s)]
*  Yeah, look at these Muslims. They're so emotional and look at them, he's yelling and screaming. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=709.92s)]
*  That's how they are. And I don't think that mainstream media, if you ask the cable news [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=715.52s)]
*  anchors, are you guys bigoted against Muslims? They'd probably be horrified at the thought. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=721.36s)]
*  No way, no way, they would say. And then their very next story they would read from the teleprompter, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=725.6s)]
*  so the savage terrorist Muslims dare to fight back against Israel, terrorist sons of bitches, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=731.36s)]
*  savages. And then Israel kills 100, 500 times as many people and they're like, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=737.84s)]
*  Israel Today reported self-defense and the human shields were used by the dirty savage terrorists, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=742.88s)]
*  Palestinian Muslims. It's exhausting, it's exhausting, and they don't even realize how [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=748.64s)]
*  racist they're being. So that's my take on it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=754.4s)]
*  Yeah, so much of what you said sent chills up my spine. You mentioned [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=757.6800000000001s)]
*  Mehdi Hassan. Remember after October 7, certain voices were silenced just because. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=762.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't even know if he reported one thing. Certain voices on certain cable networks were [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=769.8399999999999s)]
*  immediately silenced just because the thought, the site might offend. I happen to be watching [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  one of the cables, sampled some others all day, a couple days. I didn't see anything about [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=784.16s)]
*  Mr. Fine and his disgusting tweets, none of it. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=791.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think you make such an important point. There are good, everyday, smart people. But [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=797.76s)]
*  because the rhetoric, the propaganda is so ingrained, people who are minorities, you said, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=804.16s)]
*  I can certainly empathize here, but there's not a lot of empathy because people are interchanging, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  terrorists, Hamas with the Palestinian people. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=815.36s)]
*  It's exactly what you said. And even people who don't consider themselves bigoted in this way, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=820.08s)]
*  and perhaps aren't, they're not. I don't know that there's a lot of empathy. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  It's like they don't have the bandwidth for this core group. And it's scary. You started out by [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=831.52s)]
*  saying there's no protection. It's scary. Yeah, they ran out of empathy just when they got to us. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=841.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Well, you're here. You're here as a powerful voice and nobody's gonna silence you. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, they've tried, hasn't worked yet. So we fight back and by the way, I have nothing [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=856.8s)]
*  without the community. So thank you to the entire TYT community for allowing us to do this and for [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=864.24s)]
*  being a voice that speaks out, not just for Muslims. Are you crazy? No, for all of us, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=869.44s)]
*  for all of us. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=873.84s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6EpKjkywA&t=878.08s)]
