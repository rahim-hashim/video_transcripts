"Donald Trump told reporters that Tucker Carlson ‚Äúcalled and apologized‚Äù to him amid a split on the Right over U.S. involvement in Israel‚Äòs strikes on Iran.
Carlson, though, has continued to warn about the United States getting into a war in the region, and posted a video on Tuesday night in which he grilled Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) about his lack of basic knowledge about Iran."

# Trump: Tucker Apologized To Me!
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY)
*  This guy he called and apologized the other day because he thought he said things that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=0.0s)]
*  were a little bit too strong. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=4.92s)]
*  And I appreciated that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=7.12s)]
*  That was President Trump responding to the spat within MAGA about the potential US involvement [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=10.36s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=16.96s)]
*  This comes after a week of bitter infighting among the Make America Great Again base. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=18.46s)]
*  But is the MAGA movement making up and reuniting? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=23.8s)]
*  We still have questions. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=27.1s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, you might recall, hit hard at Trump throughout the week and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=28.84s)]
*  made claims that this potential war was not quote America first. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=33.04s)]
*  Additionally, earlier this week, Tucker Carlson gave Senator Ted Cruz a thorough [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=37.28s)]
*  dressing down in a brutal interview about going to war with Iran. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=42.44s)]
*  But now Donald Trump is saying that Tucker Carlson gave him a call to apologize for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  being too harsh. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=51.84s)]
*  Cenk, what do you think about this call? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=53.56s)]
*  Do you believe this report? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=55.52s)]
*  And what do you think Tucker actually said? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=57.32s)]
*  Do you think he apologized? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=59.72s)]
*  A, of course we don't know. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=62.8s)]
*  B, my guess is yes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=64.36s)]
*  And I'll tell you why. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=66.44s)]
*  I think that both Tucker and Bannon, as you'll see in a minute, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=67.84s)]
*  are playing a game of trying to win Donald Trump over to their side. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=72.92s)]
*  And they know that if you cater to his ego, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=78.8s)]
*  I hope I didn't cross a line, beloved Mr. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  President, and you're so amazing and heroic and wonderful. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=86.44s)]
*  And I'm nothing but your lowly servant. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=90.32s)]
*  But could you please not attack Iran because we kind of said anti-war. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=93.32s)]
*  That's my best guess, but I don't know. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=97.52s)]
*  And whether, okay, but I do know this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=100.4s)]
*  I'm more confident that Tucker Carlson is actually anti-war. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=105.36s)]
*  That he didn't go and say, I apologize, I think you should attack Iran. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=110.84s)]
*  No, that I would be shocked by. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=114.8s)]
*  Yeah, let's get into more. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=117.92s)]
*  For a refresher, this is what Tucker posted on X just a few days ago. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=120.24s)]
*  The real divide isn't between people who support Israel and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=124.96s)]
*  people who support Iran or the Palestinians. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=127.96s)]
*  The real divide is between those who casually encourage violence and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=130.48s)]
*  those who seek to prevent it, between warmongers and peacemakers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=134.2s)]
*  Who are the warmongers? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=138.56s)]
*  They would include anyone who's calling Donald Trump today to demand airstrikes [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  and other direct US military involvement in a war with Iran. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=144.56s)]
*  On that list, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=149.16s)]
*  Rupert Murdoch, Ike Perlmutter, and Miriam Adelson. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=152.52s)]
*  At some point, they will all have to answer for this, but [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=157.24s)]
*  you should know their names now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=160.8s)]
*  To which Trump responded calling him Kuki Carlson. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=162.68s)]
*  Posting on Truth Social, somebody please explain to Kuki Tucker Carlson that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=167.16s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=173.12s)]
*  Now let's hear more from Trump on this alleged apology call from Tucker. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=176.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=181.68s)]
*  I just see the Tucker Carlson and Senator Ted Cruz interview. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=182.52s)]
*  It seems like this issue on whether or [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  not the United States should strike is kind of dividing a lot of your supporters. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=186.84s)]
*  No, my supporters are for me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=192.44s)]
*  My supporters are America first, they make America great again. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=194.68s)]
*  My supporters don't want to see Iran have a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=198.4s)]
*  Tucker's a nice guy, he called and apologized the other day. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=201.0s)]
*  Because he thought he said things that were a little bit too strong, and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=205.16s)]
*  I appreciated that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=209.08s)]
*  And Ted Cruz is a nice guy, I mean, he's been with me for a long time. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=210.36s)]
*  I'd say once the race was over, he's been with me ever since, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=213.88s)]
*  But very simple, if they think that it's okay for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=217.52s)]
*  Iran to have a nuclear weapon, then they should oppose me. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=222.16s)]
*  But nobody thinks it's okay. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=226.72s)]
*  Now it seems that some of MAGA may be softening their tone and suggesting that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=228.76s)]
*  they will ultimately support the President if he decides to join Israel in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=233.04s)]
*  its strikes against Iran. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  Steve Bannon was one of the voices earlier this week warning that attacking [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=239.16s)]
*  Iran would split the country in half. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=242.92s)]
*  Now Bannon is saying that MAGA will trust whatever decision that Trump [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=245.28s)]
*  ultimately makes. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=249.6s)]
*  Here is Bannon speaking to reporters at a Christian Science Monitor event on [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=251.0s)]
*  Wednesday, take a look. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=255.16s)]
*  And this is why I think if President Trump decides there's not a diplomatic [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=257.04s)]
*  alternative or an economic warfare alternative that he feels, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  particularly with the nuclear situation, the fedor, that he feels that he has to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=264.6s)]
*  do it, it's in the best interest to do it, because he's been consistent. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=268.76000000000005s)]
*  No nuclear weapon, and we've said that too. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=273.44s)]
*  We've said that too, no, they cannot have, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=275.56s)]
*  they're not trustworthy enough to have a nuke. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=277.64000000000004s)]
*  President Trump decides to do that, I know, and particularly his skills as [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  a communicator, that he will come and walk people through it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  And the MAGA movement, look, there'll be some, but [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=288.04s)]
*  the vast majority of the MAGA movement go, look, we trust your judgment. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=290.48s)]
*  You've walked us through this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=294.04s)]
*  We don't like it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=295.6s)]
*  In fact, maybe we hate it, but we'll get on board. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=297.12s)]
*  Not to be outdone, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X her [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=301.8s)]
*  support of the President. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=307.36s)]
*  I'm so glad President Trump is giving time for diplomacy to work with Iran and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=313.16s)]
*  Every other American president would be dropping bombs already, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=314.04s)]
*  killing many innocent people. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=317.4s)]
*  And the neocon warmongers would be celebrating without a care of innocent [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=319.2s)]
*  lives slaughtered. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=323.72s)]
*  This is why he has a 56% approval rating. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=325.4s)]
*  I'm praying for peace and prosperity for Israel and Iran, and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=328.88s)]
*  every nation on earth, especially the USA. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=332.72s)]
*  Alex Jones was equally complimentary of Trump, but still made a, quote, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=336.4s)]
*  direct emergency warning to him while on a show with Steve Bannon. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  If you walked into the Oval Office this morning, Alex Jones, and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=346.6s)]
*  had five minutes with the Commander in Chief, go ahead and roll. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  Tell me what Alex Jones tells him right now. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=353.6s)]
*  Mr. President, I absolutely agree with you that the Molas want to destroy Israel and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  that they're unpopular and that they are a serious danger to world peace. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you what I think you should do. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  I would just ask you to please take your time on this, sir, and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=371.12s)]
*  not be stampeded into anything that could potentially not just derail your agenda [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=374.32s)]
*  to save America and the West and the world, but [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=379.24s)]
*  could trigger the end of the world as we know it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=381.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, some concerning new polling indicates that Republicans are in favor [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=385.24s)]
*  of strikes on Iran and will back Trump over his dissenters. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=389.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=394.36s)]
*  The clear majority of Republicans in any poll that you look, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  GOP on US airstrikes against Iran, if Iran's pursuing nuclear arms, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=398.88000000000005s)]
*  you see it here, the Republican Party, again, is with Donald Trump. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=402.48s)]
*  69% in this particular poll from the Chicago Council that was taken [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=406.0s)]
*  a few months ago compared to 27% who are opposed. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=409.48s)]
*  But again, even if you look at the other polling data at all points in [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  the same direction, Republicans are with Donald Trump on this particular issue, and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=416.20000000000005s)]
*  they're with Donald Trump at large. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  And when you go against Donald Trump, you go down. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=420.76000000000005s)]
*  And that's just one poll. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=423.76s)]
*  On the other hand, some polls reflect very different findings. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=424.84s)]
*  For instance, this YouGov poll found that 16% of US adults [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=428.68s)]
*  believe the US military should not get involved with Iran. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  The Economist YouGov poll we talked about earlier this week found that only 23% of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=442.44s)]
*  Republicans said we should get involved in the war, 53% said no. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=446.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Steve Bannon is going so far as to call for an investigation into [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=452.16s)]
*  various Fox News personalities, including Kayleigh McEnany, Sean Hannity, and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=456.72s)]
*  Mark Levin, who are supposedly quote, representing Israel. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=465.48s)]
*  It's almost criminal, criminal what is going on. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=466.12s)]
*  In fact, I think an investigation into what is the information Fox News is [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  getting, is money trading hands, are they getting ads? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I would actually say a farra investigation should take place, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=480.36s)]
*  a Fox News, and it should take place a Fox News starting today. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=485.64s)]
*  So there's a lot to consider here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=490.76s)]
*  Cenk, do you think that the MAGA base is getting behind this idea of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=493.4s)]
*  direct strikes, US strikes on Iran? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=498.36s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  Hey Sharon, that's okay. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=502.92s)]
*  Hi Cenk, hi Jordan. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=505.8s)]
*  Hey, so that's the first time I've seen Harry Antin be dishonest. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=507.4s)]
*  Because- Wow. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=514.16s)]
*  Yeah, I've given him a lot of credit. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=515.12s)]
*  He's pointed out issues with both sides. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=517.0s)]
*  He's been honest about the problems with the Democratic Party, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=520.76s)]
*  Republican Party, etc, and when they do well. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=522.76s)]
*  But he said he looked at all the polls. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=525.84s)]
*  No, that's not true at all. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=527.52s)]
*  So we just showed you, you got a poll, and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=529.52s)]
*  Republican voters in that poll are overwhelmingly against the war. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=531.92s)]
*  And his framing of that segment was, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  you better not oppose Donald Trump and the Republican Party, okay? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=538.36s)]
*  So if he's saying war, you gotta say war. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=542.56s)]
*  And I'll cherry pick one poll that I don't believe that poll at all. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=544.4399999999999s)]
*  It doesn't match any of the polls I've seen, okay? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=547.9599999999999s)]
*  And then Harry Antin says that one poll represents all the other polls. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=550.88s)]
*  That's just not true. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=554.04s)]
*  So I don't know why he said that, but [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=555.28s)]
*  his cable news in favor of war, always, always. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=557.0s)]
*  So that was super disappointing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=560.88s)]
*  I'd like to see him show all the polls, because I just don't believe him. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=564.48s)]
*  Not I don't believe him, it's a fact that it's not true. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=569.8800000000001s)]
*  Not only, look, you get the real official polls like you go, and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=573.0400000000001s)]
*  then there's the non-official polls. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=575.8800000000001s)]
*  I know he's not going to quote those, so [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=577.12s)]
*  this is less about Antin in that case. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=578.6800000000001s)]
*  But Charlie Kirk pulled his own audience. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=580.2s)]
*  90% said don't go to war, only 10% said yes. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=582.36s)]
*  Why do you think Charlie Kirk is even slightly dancing around the edges of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  criticizing Trump's actions here? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=590.36s)]
*  I mean, Charlie Kirk has actually been a giant ask-historist of Israel his whole [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  career. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  So why is he like, I'd tap at least say, well, maybe we shouldn't, but [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=596.92s)]
*  I'm sorry, Donald knows everything, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=599.8399999999999s)]
*  Because his own audience is like, no, no, no, we don't want to go to war, 90, 10. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=602.36s)]
*  What part of that is complicated? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=607.28s)]
*  So there's a whole Republican Party in 90, 10? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=609.16s)]
*  No, it's complicated. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=612.4399999999999s)]
*  There's the old boomers who watch cable news and Fox News, and they're like, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=614.36s)]
*  yes, war is always great. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=618.1999999999999s)]
*  We're going to do Iraq again, glory days. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=620.36s)]
*  And then there's tons of Mago who are totally against it, and [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=624.7600000000001s)]
*  there's tons of people that are Trump supporters that are in the middle and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=626.7600000000001s)]
*  don't know what to do. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=629.88s)]
*  Partly because they think, my God, Trump is amazing, and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=630.96s)]
*  he knows what he's doing. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=634.2800000000001s)]
*  And if he says, we're going to stop their nukes, but [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=635.1600000000001s)]
*  Trump's lying to you, they don't have nukes. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=637.1600000000001s)]
*  They don't have close to having nukes. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=639.36s)]
*  Now, why can I say that, but Bannon and Tucker and all of them are all tiptoeing, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=642.0400000000001s)]
*  tiptoeing, tiptoeing? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=646.08s)]
*  Because, okay, so let's be clear, there's two possibilities. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=647.2s)]
*  And I don't know which one it is, but I have a guess, and [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=652.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm curious what your guy's guess is. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=654.6s)]
*  One possibility is, yeah, they've tried to stop the war for whatever reason. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=656.72s)]
*  They thought they're on the basis of against the war, etc. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=661.76s)]
*  But then now that they haven't, they're just cowards, and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=664.96s)]
*  they're just back to licking Trump's boots. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=667.76s)]
*  The second potential reason is, if you attack Trump on this, he'll dig in, and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=670.4000000000001s)]
*  then we'll definitely have war. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=675.8399999999999s)]
*  So both of those things could be true. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=678.1999999999999s)]
*  I think Tucker Carlson is definitely against the war. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=680.64s)]
*  I think Bannon has gotten pushed there, certainly by his audience. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=684.92s)]
*  Charlie Kirk is not there at all yet, but [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=688.1999999999999s)]
*  is being pushed aggressively by his audience. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=690.76s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene with her voters, etc. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=693.3199999999999s)]
*  And so, again, I wonder what you guys think. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=697.8s)]
*  But here's how we'll know for sure. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=702.12s)]
*  This is speculation in this round. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=704.92s)]
*  But if going forward, Bannon and Tucker and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=706.9599999999999s)]
*  all those guys continue to hit the neocons and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=711.24s)]
*  the establishment and their proxies by saying things like Fox News hosts should [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=716.4s)]
*  be investigated for supporting a foreign government of Israel, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  like Bannon just said. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=725.76s)]
*  That means they are anti-war. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=727.1999999999999s)]
*  They're trying to ingratiate themselves to Donald Trump so [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=729.16s)]
*  that they don't alienate him and that he actually comes out on their side and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  they win against the neocons. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=736.04s)]
*  If it turns out Bannon and Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene, etc. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=737.48s)]
*  from now on, just go, Trump is right, the war is great, we understand. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=741.12s)]
*  He made a case where they can't have nuclear weapons and they become pro-war. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=745.28s)]
*  Then, I mean, then there's no hope for [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=749.36s)]
*  redemption for them on any issue for the rest of their lives. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=752.28s)]
*  because then that means they were the biggest frauds that anybody has ever seen. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=756.1999999999999s)]
*  And we're not going to be overly surprised by that, but it hasn't happened yet. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=760.1999999999999s)]
*  There's no question that they will all have said a thousand times that they're [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=763.92s)]
*  against war. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=768.48s)]
*  If they turn around just to lick Donald Trump's boots, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=769.48s)]
*  then you'll know exactly what their character is. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=772.7199999999999s)]
*  Okay, Sharon, what do you think's happening here? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=775.76s)]
*  Well, I think part of the problem is when you dance in an untruthful space for [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=779.24s)]
*  so long, I don't know. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=783.4s)]
*  It's probably the second one. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=785.28s)]
*  Tucker does not want war, perhaps Marjorie doesn't, but [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=787.76s)]
*  I think Tucker, Bannon, Marjorie Taylor Greene can all be bought. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=791.76s)]
*  So I just, I don't know. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  I really just don't know. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=799.32s)]
*  The other part of it is, listen, this is the guy who is at the top and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  so you have to play to his personality, play his game. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  But it's a little bit like a toddler who never picks up their toys and [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  they pick up one toy and you have to give them heaps of praise and saying, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=816.1999999999999s)]
*  you're the world's greatest cleaner. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=820.1999999999999s)]
*  Just to kind of mess with their heads and get them to pick up more. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=822.92s)]
*  That's like who Donald Trump is, but it's just like a nutty space to me. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=826.56s)]
*  I don't know who Tucker is. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=832.52s)]
*  Maybe he's so often different, I don't know, since the firing from [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=834.6s)]
*  the Fox News Channel or maybe he's up to something. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=839.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know and I didn't answer your question, Cenk, but [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=844.72s)]
*  it's just hard to tell when people move in spaces that I think have lacked [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=848.36s)]
*  integrity for a high percentage of time. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=853.08s)]
*  Yeah, I just want a quick thing before we go to Jordan. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=857.0s)]
*  He doesn't have to have softened at all. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=859.68s)]
*  He could be strategizing, hey, if I'm anti-war and to be fair to Tucker Carlson, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=862.16s)]
*  he's had an anti-war position now for a number of years, right? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=868.8s)]
*  He was for the Iraq War originally, then he apologized for [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=872.96s)]
*  that and turned against it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=875.96s)]
*  He's been anti-war throughout, but he could all just so be strategic. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=877.8s)]
*  If he's going to run in 2028 and he thinks most of MAGA is anti-war, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=882.64s)]
*  now he'll get to say, I told you not to go into Iran and [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=887.76s)]
*  remember all the other Republicans who said to go into Iran. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=891.68s)]
*  So I'm the only one you could vote for. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=895.76s)]
*  And that would actually be well played strategically on the Republican side. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=897.8s)]
*  Jordan, what do you think? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=901.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I want to point out something about the methodology in both of these polls. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=903.4s)]
*  I wouldn't say that the one CNN cited was fake per se. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=907.7199999999999s)]
*  It did seem to have a misleading premise, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=913.68s)]
*  which would goad more respondents into a certain answer. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=917.28s)]
*  If you notice what Harry Enton was saying, it was if Iran is pursuing or [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=921.7199999999999s)]
*  working toward, I can't remember the exact language, a nuclear weapon. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=928.88s)]
*  They're trying to develop nuclear arms. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=933.12s)]
*  More people then, yes, supported a strike. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=935.52s)]
*  If you look at the YouGov poll, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=938.9200000000001s)]
*  it's just a straightforward should the US get involved. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=940.12s)]
*  So when you lay that out, across the board, you do find more Americans who [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=943.48s)]
*  are opposed to Iran having nuclear weapons. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=948.4s)]
*  But what's important to drive home, and most mainstream coverage, and [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=952.12s)]
*  certainly Hawks will never mention this, US intelligence found earlier this year, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=955.7199999999999s)]
*  and of course, Tulsi Gabbard mentioned it in her confirmation hearing. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=961.3599999999999s)]
*  But separately, US intelligence found that Iran had not restarted [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=965.4s)]
*  its nuclear program. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=970.2399999999999s)]
*  They are at least years away from developing a nuclear weapon, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=971.76s)]
*  if they were to pursue the development of a nuclear weapon. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=976.76s)]
*  So to ask respondents about a current active situation in the Middle East [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=981.1999999999999s)]
*  right now under a false premise is deeply, deeply irresponsible and [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=986.4399999999999s)]
*  elicits more hawkish responses from those poll respondents. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=991.28s)]
*  Yeah, I have a couple more points. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=996.56s)]
*  First of all, that's a terrific point by Jordan about that poll that CNN featured, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=998.68s)]
*  because it's a giant false premise. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1003.52s)]
*  It's the exact kind of false premises that CNN did to drive us into a [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1005.6s)]
*  Iraq war. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1011.24s)]
*  Well, if Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, but they didn't. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1012.72s)]
*  Every time you said if, people made it seem like they do have weapons of mass [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1017.24s)]
*  destruction, Iran does have nukes. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1021.8000000000001s)]
*  But Iran doesn't have nukes, and our own intelligence has confirmed that they don't [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1023.32s)]
*  have nukes, and they're not anywhere near having nukes. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1027.8s)]
*  In fact, they don't even have a nuclear weapons program, according to Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1030.1200000000001s)]
*  at least when she was being honest in congressional hearings before her latest [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1034.1200000000001s)]
*  twist into more groveling and ass kissing of Trump, which we reported on earlier in [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1037.6s)]
*  this show. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1042.44s)]
*  So when they frame it that way, it's like framing it like this. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1043.44s)]
*  If Iran is going to kill your mother, should we do something about it? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1046.56s)]
*  Well, yeah, if they're gonna kill my mom, we should do something about it, but there's [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1049.72s)]
*  no evidence that they are gonna kill my mom. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  No, you said yes, that's it, everybody wants to attack Iran. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1056.1599999999999s)]
*  So that's garbage CNN driving us to war as usual. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1059.96s)]
*  Anyway, so if you're wondering, yeah, but which side is MAGA on? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1063.88s)]
*  There's this ludicrous theory on some portions of the left that all of MAGA is actually pro [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1068.48s)]
*  war and they're lying about being anti-war. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1075.2s)]
*  But guys, there's reasons for politicians to lie about their position, even reasons [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1079.16s)]
*  why media might lie about their position. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1084.0s)]
*  But why would a MAGA guy lie about his own position? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1086.88s)]
*  Some of their positions are heinous and they don't lie about those, just say it to you, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1091.24s)]
*  right? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1095.96s)]
*  Like, yeah, we think Abrego Garcia wasn't guilty, Mahmoud Ali was guilty, so what? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1096.96s)]
*  Lock them up, they're immigrants. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1101.84s)]
*  They don't hide any of their opinions. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1103.48s)]
*  They have no reason to hide any of their opinions. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1105.36s)]
*  And why do you think Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, etc., or all of them are pushing towards [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1107.56s)]
*  anti-war? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1111.84s)]
*  Because their voters, their audience is pushing towards anti-war. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1112.84s)]
*  So how can you tell? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1116.68s)]
*  You could tell in what is said between the lines. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1118.2s)]
*  So Alex Jones at the end, he's like, well, the president should do whatever he thinks [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1121.4s)]
*  is right. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1125.16s)]
*  He's such an amazing guy. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1126.16s)]
*  And so if he attacks Iran, though, of course, the whole world might die. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  That's Alex Jones saying, don't attack Iran, but I'm kissing your ass so you don't hate [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1132.2800000000002s)]
*  me, so you don't dig in further. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1136.5600000000002s)]
*  And even in the grumbling one that Bannon did and the one that we showed you, and he [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1139.16s)]
*  said, and if he says we should go to war, he could make a good case for it, I'm sure, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1143.4s)]
*  even if we hate it, right? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1148.88s)]
*  But you could say, no, they're all lying, and that this is all a giant trick, etc. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1152.2800000000002s)]
*  But none of that matters. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1157.0s)]
*  The only guy making the decision is Trump. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1158.0s)]
*  So let's hope to God that I'm right at least about some significant portion of the MAGA [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1160.1200000000001s)]
*  base and that they actually make a push here. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1166.2800000000002s)]
*  Is the only people who could beat the neocons within these two weeks that Trump is deciding. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1171.24s)]
*  This is another comical point that some on the left make. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1176.24s)]
*  They say, no, if we put enough pressure from the left, Trump will change his mind. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1179.2s)]
*  Come on, please, please don't embarrass yourself, please. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1183.8s)]
*  I mean, I would love to have that kind of power. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1187.28s)]
*  Okay, Trump, make sure you change your mind. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1190.52s)]
*  He's not gonna listen to the left at all. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1194.34s)]
*  He's having a contest between MAGA and the neocons. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1196.0s)]
*  So let's see what the MAGA guys have. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1199.12s)]
*  If I'm wrong and they actually love war, then okay, great, we'll see it and I'll come out [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1201.36s)]
*  and tell you about it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1204.86s)]
*  Or if they're impotent and they say, well, we didn't wanna fight the neocons. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1206.36s)]
*  And so we were okay with the war because daddy Trump told us to be okay with it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1213.26s)]
*  Then the jury will come in on MAGA and I'm curious to see how that's gonna go. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1217.6s)]
*  Sharon, last thoughts. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1221.24s)]
*  Okay, you made me laugh with that one. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1223.08s)]
*  The left has the power over Trump. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1226.08s)]
*  The only thing I'll say is this. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1228.68s)]
*  This fake escalation is so easy to detect. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1230.4s)]
*  I mean, if this were real, you don't need two weeks. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1234.88s)]
*  This is minute by minute, not even day by day. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1238.6000000000001s)]
*  This is imminent. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1242.68s)]
*  So this whole thing that in two weeks he'll decide and those people who are the last in [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1244.5600000000002s)]
*  his dear can maybe get him to move one way or the other is just, I just find it so silly. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1249.24s)]
*  If it weren't so serious, it would actually be funny. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1255.96s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1258.88s)]
*  I don't know if the best use of our time is to determine whether or not these people are [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1259.88s)]
*  sincere in being anti-war. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1267.16s)]
*  Let them demonstrate their values through their actions, right? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1270.88s)]
*  They can say what they want, but we'll just believe them when it comes down to when things [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1273.68s)]
*  actually escalate. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1279.68s)]
*  When we are participating, if they flip and they throw their support behind Trump full [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1280.88s)]
*  throated, we know them to be liars. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1285.16s)]
*  So I'm just gonna wait and see for most of these figures. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1288.68s)]
*  That's a super sensible position, right? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1292.18s)]
*  And so, so far two people have proved themselves as actually anti-war. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1294.44s)]
*  Thomas Massey and then on the media side, Dave Smith. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1298.48s)]
*  So the libertarians have come in principled and bless their hearts. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1302.5800000000002s)]
*  Dave Smith agreed with us that we should unite against the war. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TofCBMj4BYY&t=1306.88s)]
