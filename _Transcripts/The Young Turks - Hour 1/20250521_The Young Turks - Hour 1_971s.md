"To borrow from Stephen A. Smith, voters  "don't care. They don't care" if the GOP bill will raise the deficit. 

60% overall and 74% of GOP want tax cuts, even if they raise the deficit.

No wonder the last president to lower the debt over his presidency was Coolidge. "

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# There's ONE Major Issue That Americans Really Don't Care About
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc)
*  Cut taxes even if the deficit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=0.0s)]
*  increases. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=2.0s)]
*  Look at this, 60% overall say, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=3.08s)]
*  cut those taxes, baby. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=5.22s)]
*  What about Republicans? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  They're the ones who are supposedly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  so concerned over the deficit. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=10.72s)]
*  But even there, 74% say cut taxes [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=12.38s)]
*  even if the deficit increases. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=15.3s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=20.06s)]
*  Most Americans not worried about [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=21.02s)]
*  the deficit and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  honestly who can blame them? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Because the deficit hasn't really [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=26.1s)]
*  hurt us too much yet. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=29.22s)]
*  Now, yet is an interesting way of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=30.98s)]
*  putting it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=33.32s)]
*  Of course, Moody's just recently [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=34.28s)]
*  came out and lowered America's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=36.68s)]
*  AAA credit rating. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  Meaning that they have less [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=41.28s)]
*  confidence that the United States [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=43.12s)]
*  government will pay its debts. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=45.36s)]
*  They're worried that there's a [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=48.08s)]
*  higher risk that the US could [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=50.06s)]
*  default on its debt. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=51.84s)]
*  That's pretty terrifying. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=53.72s)]
*  Now to be fair, this is the third [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=55.44s)]
*  time the US credit rating has [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=57.74s)]
*  dropped. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=59.94s)]
*  And the past two times, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=61.82s)]
*  it was mostly symbolic. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=63.26s)]
*  It didn't end up being a disaster. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=64.82s)]
*  I believe 2011 was the previous, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=66.98s)]
*  more recent time that our credit [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=69.86s)]
*  rating was lowered. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=72.62s)]
*  But it doesn't really inspire [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=75.1s)]
*  confidence. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  Moody's did this in response to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=78.58s)]
*  Trump's big beautiful bill. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=80.78s)]
*  They're worried that because of how [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=83.02s)]
*  much debt it will add to the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  ballooning US debt, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  which is at $36 trillion. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=88.61999999999999s)]
*  It's going to make it more and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=90.52s)]
*  more expensive for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  the United States to service its [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=93.28s)]
*  debt. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  Last year, we paid close to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  a trillion dollars to do so. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=97.3s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  And it's not something that most [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=100.44s)]
*  Americans are feeling yet, but [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=102.44s)]
*  it could balloon to a point where [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  they're going to feel it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  So with that in mind, look, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=108.12s)]
*  they're not worried about the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=109.96s)]
*  deficit because what's hurting them [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=112.08s)]
*  in the immediate environment is the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=115.33999999999999s)]
*  fact that they don't have a lot of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  money in their pockets. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  This economy is crushing a lot of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=121.17999999999999s)]
*  Americans and they want a little [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=123.02s)]
*  bit of relief. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=124.94s)]
*  So the idea of paying a little less [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=126.22s)]
*  in taxes is exciting for Americans. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=128.44s)]
*  And so I want to get into that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=131.29999999999998s)]
*  So here's how Americans felt, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=132.82s)]
*  like 30 years ago, Americans might [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  have felt a little differently. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=137.78s)]
*  So Harry Enton decided to delve [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=140.18s)]
*  into that polling from last [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=141.98s)]
*  December that showed how voters [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=143.52s)]
*  want the tax cuts regardless of how [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=145.3s)]
*  it impacts the deficit. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=147.28s)]
*  And that is a massive change from [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=149.32s)]
*  how Americans felt about the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=151.16s)]
*  deficit only 30 years ago, all [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=152.76s)]
*  right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=154.48s)]
*  So things do change and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=155.0s)]
*  here's what I mean. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=156.2s)]
*  Cut taxes even at the deficit [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=158.56s)]
*  increases now, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=160.0s)]
*  it's that 60% we spoke about. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=160.8s)]
*  But back in 1996, the real last [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=162.88s)]
*  time where there really was a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=164.8s)]
*  movement to bring that deficit [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=166.4s)]
*  down, bring that debt down, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=168.1s)]
*  it was just 23% who said cut taxes [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=169.8s)]
*  even if the deficit increases. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=171.9s)]
*  So we've nearly seen a tripling, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=174.06s)]
*  far more than doubling of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=176.14s)]
*  the percentage of Americans who say [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=177.82s)]
*  that we should cut those taxes, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=180.06s)]
*  even if the deficit increases. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=182.06s)]
*  And that's where we're standing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=184.34s)]
*  right now basically amongst [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=185.66s)]
*  the American public. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=186.78s)]
*  Who says 1996 instead of 1996? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  Harry Enton does. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=194.66s)]
*  Look, I think Harry Enton does [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=196.06s)]
*  a great job with broadcasting and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=197.46s)]
*  I love that he delves into these [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  holes and shows like the historical [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=200.72s)]
*  context because yeah, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=202.6s)]
*  things have changed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=203.88s)]
*  I suspect that things have changed [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=205.32s)]
*  because Americans are feeling more [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=207.28s)]
*  crushed by the economy today than [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=209.28s)]
*  they did in the past. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=211.04s)]
*  And look, this is all speculation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=212.44s)]
*  I don't have evidence to back what [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=214.6s)]
*  I'm about to say up, but just based [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=216.6s)]
*  on my own personal feelings lately [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  about taxes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  Look, no one likes to pay taxes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  Everyone would like to keep more of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=224.76s)]
*  their money in their pockets, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=226.44s)]
*  obviously. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  However, I'm also very much open to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=228.74s)]
*  paying more in taxes if the money [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=231.72s)]
*  specifically goes towards social [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=234.26s)]

*  wants to do? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=360.34s)]
*  He's going to get the state [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=360.97999999999996s)]
*  Medicaid program. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=362.34s)]

*  If you are so poor, then you [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=364.38s)]

*  the poorest people in the state? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=384.54s)]
*  Just absolute scumbag. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=388.36s)]
*  So look, Americans would like to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=390.48s)]
*  keep more of their money, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=392.52000000000004s)]

*  their own finances, of course. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=396.44s)]
*  But also because they look at [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=398.24s)]
*  the government, they see where [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=399.9s)]
*  their money's going and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=401.5s)]

*  They're not happy about it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=403.7s)]
*  And I don't blame them. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=404.86s)]
*  Who can blame them? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=406.74s)]
*  Americans keep paying more and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=408.94s)]
*  more in taxes. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  They see their quality of life [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=410.82s)]
*  diminish, who can blame them? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=412.06s)]
*  Now, obviously here I'm talking [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=413.74s)]
*  about working class Americans. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=415.42s)]
*  When it comes to corporations, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=417.9s)]
*  when it comes to the wealthiest [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=419.46s)]
*  among us, they get to enjoy all [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=420.94s)]
*  sorts of little tax breaks and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=422.5s)]
*  deductions that ordinary working [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=424.02s)]
*  class people don't get to enjoy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=425.78s)]
*  And I think it's unfair that if [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=428.96s)]
*  we're going to pay taxes, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  oftentimes they pay a far smaller [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=432.29999999999995s)]
*  percentage of their income in [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=434.56s)]
*  federal taxes compared to working [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=436.52s)]
*  class Americans. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=438.64s)]
*  That unfairness, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=440.08s)]
*  something needs to be done about [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=441.2s)]
*  that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=443.44s)]
*  Now, obviously you have lawmakers [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=444.68s)]
*  heeding the warning that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=447.28s)]
*  fear mongering about the deficit [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=449.08s)]
*  is not going to play well with [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=451.44s)]
*  the American people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=453.44s)]
*  So I want to give you a sense of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=455.47999999999996s)]
*  what their messaging and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=457.14s)]
*  what their priorities happen to be. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=458.5s)]
*  So while Republicans want to cut [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=460.74s)]
*  Medicaid to lower the deficit, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=462.74s)]
*  Bernie Sanders doesn't. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=464.78000000000003s)]
*  This is what he wrote on X. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=466.74s)]
*  There are 85 million Americans who [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=468.54s)]

*  So embarrassing that that's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=472.26s)]
*  the case. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=473.7s)]
*  Republicans want to make a bad [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  situation worse by slashing [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=476.02s)]
*  Medicaid in order to give massive [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=477.6s)]
*  tax breaks to billionaires. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=479.42s)]
*  Wrong. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=481.5s)]
*  We should do what other major [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=482.94s)]
*  countries do and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=484.66s)]
*  guarantee healthcare for all. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=485.64s)]
*  Now look, there were various [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=488.64s)]
*  analyses done in regard to [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=490.44s)]
*  Medicare for all when Bernie [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=492.0s)]
*  Sanders was running for president. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=493.7s)]
*  And I remember when a libertarian [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=496.2s)]
*  think tank came out with their [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=498.12s)]

*  Medicare for all system was actually [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=501.56s)]
*  going to save like $2 trillion in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  10 years. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=506.04s)]
*  So I mean, we pay more than any [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=508.2s)]
*  other developed country for [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=510.2s)]

*  Hakeem Jeffries didn't go nearly as [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=519.9s)]

*  indicating that Trump told [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=540.98s)]
*  Republicans in the House don't [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  f around with Medicaid. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=544.62s)]
*  We'll see what ends up happening, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=546.9200000000001s)]
*  right? I don't know who to believe, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=548.48s)]
*  especially when it's anonymous [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=550.24s)]
*  sources telling reporters that [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=551.84s)]
*  that's what Trump is saying behind [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=553.38s)]
*  the scenes. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=555.08s)]
*  We also heard that Biden was [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  pressuring Israel to do a cease [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=558.12s)]
*  fire and that turned out to be [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=560.08s)]
*  complete and utter lies. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=561.84s)]
*  So I'll believe it when I see it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=563.36s)]
*  However, Alissa Farah Griffin and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=565.48s)]
*  Republican strategist, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=567.6400000000001s)]
*  sure Michael Singleton think that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=569.26s)]
*  they did as well. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=571.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=573.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, let's take a look. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=573.98s)]
*  There's kind of been so [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=576.1800000000001s)]
*  much posturing if they're going to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=577.02s)]
*  slash this, if they're going to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=578.22s)]
*  slash this until people feel it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=579.22s)]
*  I feel like it can kind of feel [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=580.98s)]
*  like empty noise from the guys. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=582.0600000000001s)]
*  I agree 150%. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=583.0600000000001s)]
*  And if you're a Democrat, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=585.0600000000001s)]
*  I think you have to be careful [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=585.86s)]
*  here because from Republicans, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=586.74s)]
*  I would argue we could frame this [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=587.98s)]
*  as if you're an able to body [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=589.34s)]
*  person, should that person go out [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=590.62s)]
*  and work? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=592.62s)]
*  Most people would say, well, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=593.74s)]
*  hell yeah, Kate, they should work. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=595.02s)]
*  We're not saying that if you don't [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=596.38s)]
*  make enough beyond a certain [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=597.78s)]
*  threshold that you shouldn't still [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=598.98s)]
*  be able to tap into a safety net. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=600.38s)]
*  You also got millions of people [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=601.48s)]
*  who are going to lose benefits. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  They can lean on that. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=603.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=604.48s)]
*  They can, but I just don't know how [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=604.98s)]
*  effective that's going to be when [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=606.08s)]
*  the average person is saying, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=607.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm working my butt off. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  Everybody else should also be out [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=609.12s)]
*  there working. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=610.36s)]
*  That statement from sure Michael [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  Singleton is pretty accurate [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=616.0400000000001s)]
*  actually, right? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that there's a lot of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=618.88s)]
*  resentment right now among working [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=620.48s)]
*  class Americans who are barely [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=622.52s)]
*  getting by. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=624.2800000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately, there's a lot [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=625.1600000000001s)]
*  of propaganda out there that makes [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=627.32s)]
*  it appear as though people are [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=629.5s)]
*  getting paid to be lazy bums and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=631.46s)]
*  not work. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=633.54s)]
*  It's important to know what [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=634.9s)]
*  the reality is though, because that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=636.34s)]
*  resentment unfortunately comes from [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=638.3000000000001s)]
*  a place of being misinformed. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=640.32s)]
*  Of course, you're always going to [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=642.0600000000001s)]
*  have bad people take advantage. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=644.34s)]
*  But the important thing is you have [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=646.74s)]
*  to take a step back and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=648.58s)]
*  look at what the trends are. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=649.74s)]
*  Is this a wide scale issue when it [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=651.1800000000001s)]
*  comes to Medicaid recipients? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=653.7s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is it's [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=656.34s)]
*  not. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=658.38s)]
*  Now, unfortunately more than 60% [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=659.42s)]
*  of voters, including 47% of [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=661.74s)]
*  Democrats support the idea of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=663.68s)]
*  a work requirement in order to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=665.72s)]
*  receive Medicaid. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=667.7s)]
*  Work requirements are significantly [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=670.14s)]
*  more popular than straight up cuts [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=672.14s)]
*  to Medicaid, which is good, right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=674.02s)]
*  I mean, it's not good that people [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=675.9s)]
*  are like, Look, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=678.06s)]
*  I'm not against work requirements [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=679.18s)]
*  necessarily, I'm against the idea [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=681.62s)]
*  that Medicaid recipients are all [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=684.08s)]
*  like lazy bums who don't want to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=686.28s)]
*  work and are taking advantage of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  the system. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=690.4s)]
*  I find that so offensive, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=691.3599999999999s)]
*  especially because of what I know [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=693.16s)]
*  and what the data shows. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  And Americans are really hard [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=697.24s)]
*  working people generally speaking. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=699.0999999999999s)]
*  Americans want to feel they have [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=701.52s)]
*  a purpose in life. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=703.3s)]
*  They don't want to sit around and [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=704.3599999999999s)]
*  do nothing all day. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=706.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes, you're going to find examples [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=707.3199999999999s)]
*  of people who do fall under that [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=709.28s)]
*  category. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=711.0s)]
*  But I'm talking about generally [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=711.5999999999999s)]
*  Americans want to have a job, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=713.7199999999999s)]
*  they want to have a job, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=715.4s)]
*  have a purpose in life. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=717.26s)]
*  So let's get to the work [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=719.74s)]
*  requirements and how they fare [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=721.5s)]
*  compared to straight up cuts to [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=724.0s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=726.3399999999999s)]
*  So just 17% of respondents said [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=727.2199999999999s)]
*  they supported cuts to Medicaid. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=729.3s)]
*  40% said they wanted to keep [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=731.5s)]
*  spending unchanged and 42% said [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=733.8599999999999s)]
*  they would like it increased. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=736.6999999999999s)]
*  So that might be due to [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=739.62s)]
*  misconceptions about the program. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=740.6999999999999s)]
*  That's why I get irritated by this [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=743.0999999999999s)]
*  conversation or [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=744.8199999999999s)]
*  whole debate because guess what? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=745.72s)]
*  A majority 62% of the public [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=747.4000000000001s)]
*  incorrectly believe that most [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=749.72s)]
*  working age adults on Medicaid are [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=752.36s)]
*  unemployed, but they're not. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=755.2800000000001s)]
*  So like about 40, I'm sorry, 64% [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  of Medicaid recipients are either [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=761.6s)]
*  working full time jobs or [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=764.2s)]
*  part time jobs. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=766.08s)]
*  The rest of the individuals who [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=767.8000000000001s)]
*  are not working are either going to [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  school or they are caretakers for [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=771.9200000000001s)]
*  elderly or elderly family members [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=774.22s)]
*  or individuals who have fallen ill [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=776.6s)]
*  in their family. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=779.1s)]
*  So the way that the work [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=781.26s)]
*  requirements are currently being [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=782.98s)]
*  proposed for this reconciliation [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=785.4000000000001s)]
*  bill, you work what? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=787.98s)]
*  40 hours, I believe it was for [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=789.86s)]
*  the whole month and [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=791.98s)]
*  you would qualify for Medicaid. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=793.24s)]
*  Well, nothing would change. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=795.82s)]
*  The only thing that would change [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=798.6600000000001s)]
*  if the bill passes with those work [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=800.1800000000001s)]
*  requirements is that there would be [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=801.86s)]
*  an extra paperwork for recipients [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=803.72s)]
*  to have to file to get approved for [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=805.8000000000001s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=807.76s)]
*  And some people might have [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=808.48s)]
*  difficulty with that paperwork. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=809.96s)]
*  Some people might have a difficult [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=811.88s)]
*  time navigating however their [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=813.88s)]
*  state sets up the bureaucracy in [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=815.6400000000001s)]
*  order to carry out that program, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=817.5400000000001s)]
*  in order to check to make sure [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=819.44s)]
*  they're working. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=821.08s)]
*  And if it's too difficult, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=822.2800000000001s)]
*  it might serve as an obstacle [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=823.96s)]
*  between them and getting the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=825.6s)]
*  healthcare that they're entitled to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=827.2s)]
*  and the healthcare that they need. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=829.2800000000001s)]
*  And that is what happens [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=831.36s)]
*  typically, or typically I should [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=832.62s)]
*  say. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=834.26s)]
*  Some states by the way, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=834.78s)]
*  don't want to do the work [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=836.14s)]
*  requirements because guess what? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=837.5s)]
*  You have to prop up a bureaucratic [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=839.26s)]
*  system to process applications and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=841.66s)]
*  do the checks to make sure these [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=844.1s)]
*  people are working and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=846.1s)]
*  that costs tens of millions of [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=847.46s)]
*  dollars. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=849.34s)]
*  In Georgia, it costs $40 million [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=849.9s)]
*  according to one analysis. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=851.94s)]
*  So it ends up actually costing more [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=853.9s)]
*  in taxpayer money to do this work [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=856.6600000000001s)]
*  requirement program than not. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=859.3000000000001s)]
*  So let's get to seven years ago [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=862.04s)]
*  where the state of Arkansas tried [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=863.8199999999999s)]
*  to implement Medicaid work [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=865.8s)]
*  requirements and [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=867.52s)]
*  here's how it turned out. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=868.56s)]
*  The state used the requirements to [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  remove 18,000 adults from the [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=872.88s)]
*  Medicaid rolls in just four months. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=875.04s)]
*  Yet subsequent studies found that [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=877.88s)]
*  it had no positive employment [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=880.28s)]
*  effect. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=882.28s)]
*  And when you take a look at who [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=883.88s)]
*  received Medicaid in 2022, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=885.64s)]
*  let's take a look at that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=887.4399999999999s)]
*  Look at that, 46% were either [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=889.24s)]
*  children or 65 years old and up, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=891.3s)]
*  meaning they were elderly. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=893.86s)]
*  Of the remaining 54%, only 6% were [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=896.18s)]
*  not working long term. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=899.66s)]
*  That's just 3% of all Medicaid [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=901.6999999999999s)]
*  recipients. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=904.3s)]
*  So that was an analysis that was [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=905.06s)]
*  done using Census Bureau [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=907.5799999999999s)]
*  information back in 2022. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=909.62s)]
*  We'll see how this whole bill ends [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=912.02s)]
*  up, but it's definitely not going [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=914.6999999999999s)]
*  to balance the budget. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=917.5s)]
*  It's definitely not going to [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=919.68s)]
*  balance the budget, that's for sure. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=920.76s)]
*  But on top of that, I think what's [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=922.12s)]
*  being targeted by the Republican [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=924.12s)]
*  Party kind of shows you what their [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=926.24s)]
*  priorities are. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=928.24s)]
*  I mean, there are definitely areas [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=929.8399999999999s)]
*  where we can save a lot of money. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=931.68s)]
*  Maybe we stop funding foreign wars, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=933.48s)]
*  that's one possibility. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=935.88s)]
*  Maybe we allow our Medicare system [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=937.88s)]
*  to negotiate pharmaceutical drug [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=940.24s)]
*  prices so American taxpayers aren't [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=942.52s)]
*  getting fleeced on pharmaceutical [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=944.92s)]
*  drugs. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=947.24s)]
*  But notice how those are the areas [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=948.5s)]
*  that are totally being neglected [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=950.4000000000001s)]
*  when it comes to balancing [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=952.2800000000001s)]
*  the budget. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=953.6600000000001s)]
*  Nickel and diming the American [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=955.58s)]
*  people on healthcare programs is [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=957.38s)]
*  pretty sick, but that's what [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=959.3000000000001s)]
*  they're focusing on. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=960.84s)]
*  And Americans don't care about [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=962.7s)]
*  the deficit. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9cZwTEiSc&t=963.7800000000001s)]
