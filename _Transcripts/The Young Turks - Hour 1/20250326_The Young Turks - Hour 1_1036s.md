TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# SHOCKING Video of Masked Thugs Abducting A Pro-Palestine Student
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI)
*  Yesterday, men dressed in street [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=0.0s)]
*  clothes who identified themselves [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=2.46s)]
*  as simply the police arrested [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=5.14s)]
*  Tufts University student Rumiessa [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=7.38s)]
*  Ozturk after she co authored [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  an op-ed that was critical of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=12.42s)]
*  Israel, and that's it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=14.84s)]
*  She simply co authored an op-ed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=16.98s)]
*  that was critical of Israel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Now before we get into her so [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=21.64s)]
*  called anti-Israel activism, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=23.1s)]
*  as some people have decided to put [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=24.82s)]
*  it, here's some more on who she is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=26.62s)]
*  and what happened. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=28.62s)]
*  So Ozturk is a 30 year old Turkish [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=30.14s)]
*  national who is currently a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=32.56s)]
*  doctoral student at Tufts. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=34.42s)]
*  Now this happened in a residential [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=36.78s)]
*  neighborhood at around 530 when [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=39.56s)]
*  Ozturk was heading out to meet [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=42.0s)]
*  some friends for Iftar, a meal that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=44.22s)]
*  actually breaks the fast during [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  Ramadan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=49.22s)]
*  Now according to residents in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=50.42s)]
*  the neighborhood who apparently [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=52.34s)]
*  witnessed this, these DHS agents [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=54.44s)]
*  all had their faces covered and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=56.78s)]
*  they were in unmarked vehicles. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=59.74s)]
*  So you saw the footage for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  yourselves, you saw the men, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  you can notice that their faces are [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=64.52s)]
*  covered and their vehicle was [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=66.16s)]
*  an unmarked car. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=67.7s)]
*  Now according to Ozturk's attorney, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=69.5s)]
*  her name is Masha, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=72.4s)]
*  when reports started coming out, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=73.88s)]
*  he stated we are unaware of her [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=76.36s)]
*  whereabouts and have not been able [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=78.7s)]
*  to contact her. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=81.2s)]
*  No charges have been filed against [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  her to date that we are aware of, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=84.76s)]
*  the lawyer said in a statement. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  Now Ozturk has a visa allowing her [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=89.16s)]
*  to study in the United States. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=91.24s)]
*  So she's not a permanent resident, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=93.44s)]
*  she's not a green card holder, but [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  she does have a visa and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  is in the United States legally. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=97.8s)]
*  As I mentioned earlier, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=99.88s)]
*  she's a doctoral student. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  Now according to Salon though, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=101.72s)]
*  as of this evening, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=103.6s)]
*  the ICE database listed her as [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=104.8s)]
*  being detained at an ICE processing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=106.44s)]
*  center in Louisiana. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=108.52s)]
*  If you can recall, Mahmoud Khalil [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=110.28s)]
*  was also sent to a detention [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=112.6s)]
*  facility in Louisiana. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  And this dispute, and by the way, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  this is despite a federal judge [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=118.8s)]
*  stating just yesterday that ICE [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=120.92s)]
*  could not remove Ozturk from [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=123.0s)]
*  Massachusetts, where she currently [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=124.84s)]
*  resided without notice. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  I don't understand why it took [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=129.16s)]
*  the government nearly 24 hours to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=131.0s)]
*  let me know her whereabouts. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=133.16s)]
*  Why was she transferred to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  Louisiana despite the court's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=136.44s)]
*  order is beyond me? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=138.16s)]
*  Rumiessa should immediately be [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  brought back to Massachusetts, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=142.44s)]
*  released and allowed to return to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=144.68s)]
*  complete her PhD program. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=146.84s)]
*  I want to ask you, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=148.88s)]
*  this is a statement from [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=149.72s)]
*  her attorney. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=150.96s)]
*  I want to get into whether or [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=151.76s)]
*  not Ozturk posed any kind of threat [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=153.44s)]
*  as a doctoral student on a visa in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=155.64s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=158.0s)]
*  We'll get to that in just a minute. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=159.56s)]
*  But Cenk, this is freaking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  terrifying because literally all [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=162.76s)]
*  that's been cited is that she [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=165.0s)]
*  co-authored an op-ed that Israel [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=166.8s)]
*  doesn't like. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=169.0s)]
*  I mean, it's- [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=170.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=170.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=171.6s)]
*  No, so that's the Israeli thought [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=172.2s)]
*  police on American streets, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=174.8s)]
*  kidnapping Americans or in this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=177.48s)]
*  case, people that are legally [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=179.52s)]
*  allowed to be here on a student [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=181.4s)]
*  visa. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=183.32s)]
*  They have also done it to legal [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=183.84s)]
*  residents who have green cards. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=185.32s)]
*  And they're saying apparently the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=187.0s)]
*  biggest crime in America now is [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=188.56s)]
*  criticizing Israel. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=189.96s)]
*  And part of the reason they're [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=191.0s)]
*  doing it to these folks is because [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=192.68s)]
*  they think they can. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=194.6s)]
*  It's a little bit harder to arrest [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=195.96s)]
*  American citizens for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=198.24s)]
*  criticizing Israel, but [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=199.84s)]
*  we're warming up to it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=201.56s)]
*  But when they came for [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=203.64s)]
*  someone with a student visa, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=204.68s)]
*  you didn't fight back because you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=206.28s)]
*  weren't on a student visa. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=207.96s)]
*  And they came for [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=209.8s)]
*  someone who's a legal resident, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=210.36s)]
*  but you didn't fight back because [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=211.56s)]
*  you're not a legal resident. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=212.68s)]
*  When they come for you, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=214.0s)]
*  there'll be no one here to defend [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  So that's the idea, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=217.0s)]
*  you intimidate, you bully. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  If anyone dares criticize Israel, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=220.12s)]
*  you see masked men on American [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=222.16s)]
*  streets picking them up, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=223.72s)]
*  just saying we're police. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  We don't even know who they are. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=226.28s)]
*  There's the irony that one of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=227.60000000000002s)]

*  it's not Erdogan, it's in America. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=252.68s)]

*  You've got to identify yourself. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=295.96s)]

*  You can hear it in the video. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  And are you the police or [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=303.0s)]
*  are you ICE? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=304.2s)]

*  But I'm sorry, I don't want to ask [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=308.44s)]
*  too many questions because Israel [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=310.12s)]
*  might remove me from America for [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=311.92s)]
*  asking questions about Israel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=313.48s)]
*  This is just the most outrageous. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=315.76s)]
*  And this is all under America [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=317.4s)]
*  first? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=319.2s)]
*  That's becoming a sick joke. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=320.64s)]
*  And guys, this is over a published [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=322.28s)]
*  flop ed that she co-authored that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=324.56s)]

*  if you're here on a visa and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=330.35999999999996s)]

*  No, they don't actually. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=336.32s)]
*  The Supreme Court has weighed in on [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=337.47999999999996s)]

*  their political views, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=355.72s)]
*  their beliefs, okay? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=357.36s)]
*  And in this case, I mean, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=358.8s)]
*  it's just an op-ed that's critical [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=360.24s)]

*  Court precedent, etc. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=374.56s)]
*  But also because those same folks [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=375.72s)]
*  can criticize America all they like. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=377.64000000000004s)]

*  Now Ozturk came to the US to get [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=477.28s)]
*  her master's degree at Columbia as [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=478.88s)]
*  a Fulbright Scholar. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=480.88s)]
*  Wow, she sounds very dangerous. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=482.12s)]
*  Now she researched media literacy, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=484.48s)]
*  representation in children's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=486.52s)]
*  television, and pro-social [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=488.32s)]
*  development according to a 2021 [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=490.03999999999996s)]
*  social media post. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  She was also the co-founder of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=494.0s)]
*  an independent children's media [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=495.52s)]
*  initiative in Istanbul. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=497.32s)]
*  Yeah, sounds super dangerous, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=498.96s)]
*  maybe a terrorist. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, children programming, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=501.52s)]
*  my God, what an outrageous threat [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=503.4s)]
*  to national security. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=505.4s)]
*  So Blige also says that Ozturk is [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=507.08s)]
*  very soft spoken. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=509.2s)]
*  If you were actually to have a chat [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=510.76s)]
*  with her for about five minutes, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=512.88s)]
*  you would understand how kind and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=514.88s)]
*  how decent a person she is. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=516.92s)]
*  So look, there's no indication. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=518.68s)]
*  I haven't seen a single thing that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=521.52s)]
*  indicates that she is a threat, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=523.24s)]
*  that she is in any way hindering [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=524.96s)]
*  the foreign policy objectives of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=526.64s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=528.36s)]
*  So according to Salon, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=530.44s)]
*  Ozturk was allegedly flagged by [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=532.08s)]
*  the pro-Israel organization [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=534.48s)]
*  Canary Mission for having engaged [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=536.6s)]
*  in anti-Israel activism in March of [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=539.2s)]
*  2024. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=542.0s)]
*  So a year ago, an interest group [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=542.52s)]
*  that apparently is monitoring [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=544.8000000000001s)]
*  people in this country for [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=546.96s)]
*  not being adequately pro-Israel [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  enough flagged her. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=551.28s)]
*  That activism, according to the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=552.88s)]
*  group, consisted entirely of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=555.08s)]
*  co-authoring an op-ed in [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=557.0400000000001s)]
*  the Tufts Daily, a student [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  newspaper. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=560.52s)]
*  Bro, what are you guys doing? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=561.4000000000001s)]
*  That group, are you on a mission to [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  increase anti-Semitism in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=565.4000000000001s)]
*  the United States? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=567.36s)]
*  Apparently. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  You're going after the authors of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  an op-ed in a university paper. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=572.88s)]
*  Okay, well, you just drew a lot [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=576.12s)]
*  more attention to that piece. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=578.32s)]
*  I hadn't read it, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to read it now. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=581.44s)]
*  I might actually do a segment on it [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  on the show tomorrow. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  But nonetheless, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  that's what this is all about. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=586.48s)]
*  So it's in the Tufts Daily, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=588.68s)]
*  a student newspaper in which she [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=590.16s)]
*  and three other graduate students [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=591.88s)]
*  called on the school to acknowledge [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=593.88s)]
*  the Palestinian genocide and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=595.88s)]
*  divest from companies with ties to [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=597.68s)]
*  Israel as called for in resolutions [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=599.72s)]
*  passed by the Student Senate. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=601.96s)]
*  We as graduate students affirm the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=603.96s)]
*  equal dignity and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=605.88s)]
*  humanity of all people. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=606.88s)]
*  The students wrote in the article, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=608.12s)]
*  wow. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=609.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=610.48s)]
*  Sounds dangerous. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=611.68s)]
*  I feel like our national security [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=613.12s)]
*  is really under threat. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=614.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=616.2s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't know anybody [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=616.92s)]
*  spreading more anti-Semitism than [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=618.8s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu groups like [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=621.12s)]
*  Canary Mission. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=623.04s)]
*  And look, among all the terrible [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=624.28s)]
*  consequences of this is I'm worried [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=626.24s)]
*  about my Jewish friends and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=628.4399999999999s)]
*  my Jewish family. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=630.12s)]
*  Because these guys are going around [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=631.96s)]
*  and go, if you criticize Israel, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=633.56s)]
*  we're going to snatch you up off [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=635.0s)]
*  the streets, show you you can [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=636.28s)]
*  never criticize. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=637.56s)]
*  Are you insane? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=638.36s)]
*  Are you insane? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=639.52s)]
*  What is that going to do? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=641.16s)]
*  That's going to get everybody to [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=642.68s)]
*  see the Jews run the world. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=644.44s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=646.2800000000001s)]
*  My friends don't run the world. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  They got nothing to do with this. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=648.36s)]
*  Some of the best peace protesters [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=649.76s)]
*  are Jewish, but you idiot lunatics [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  are going around being giant thugs [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=653.6s)]
*  to everyone who disagrees. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=655.6s)]
*  Cut off Columbia's funding. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=657.1600000000001s)]
*  Arrest anyone who criticizes her. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=659.48s)]
*  You know why they're so [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=661.5200000000001s)]
*  upset about her? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=662.6s)]
*  Because the op-ed called for [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  an economic boycott. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=664.88s)]
*  And that's the thing that there's [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=666.5200000000001s)]
*  two things that triggers the [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  Israeli supporters more than [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=668.6s)]
*  anything else. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=669.72s)]
*  One, if you call them colonial, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=670.76s)]
*  what they're doing colonialism. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=674.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=676.0s)]
*  it just went like this, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=677.3199999999999s)]
*  I didn't understand in the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=679.76s)]
*  beginning either. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=680.52s)]
*  I was like, why do you care so [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=681.0799999999999s)]
*  much about that? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=681.9599999999999s)]
*  And I thought maybe it was [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=683.36s)]
*  a racial thing or they don't want [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=684.0s)]
*  to be called white and they're [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=685.12s)]
*  actually originally from the area. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=686.16s)]
*  So no, it turns out they don't want [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=688.56s)]
*  you to talk about how they become [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=691.16s)]
*  an imperial empire. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=693.64s)]
*  because what is Eretz Israel? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=695.5999999999999s)]
*  What is greater Israel? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=697.0s)]
*  What is this Benjamin Net Yahoo [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=698.3199999999999s)]
*  described it from the river [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=699.88s)]
*  to the sea? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=701.5999999999999s)]
*  Israel wants to control more land. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=703.36s)]
*  And they brag about it in Israel. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=705.52s)]
*  The American media almost never [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=708.04s)]
*  talks about it, but they want [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=709.56s)]
*  the West Bank, Gaza Strip, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=711.04s)]
*  Southern Lebanon, and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=712.56s)]
*  Western Syria. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=713.88s)]
*  And lo and behold, there they are [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=715.8399999999999s)]
*  in Western Syria, West Bank, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=717.56s)]
*  Gaza Strip, and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=719.04s)]
*  was recently in Southern Lebanon. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=719.9599999999999s)]
*  Let me take over for a second. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=722.52s)]
*  And it's a very easy, clear message [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=724.0s)]
*  which I'm sure that the folks over [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=726.48s)]
*  at the Canary Organization [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=728.8399999999999s)]
*  are going to reject. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=730.76s)]
*  But that's okay, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=732.04s)]
*  we can continue rejecting it, but [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=732.76s)]
*  everyone else sees it for [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFX-rDuaBKI&t=734.16s)]
