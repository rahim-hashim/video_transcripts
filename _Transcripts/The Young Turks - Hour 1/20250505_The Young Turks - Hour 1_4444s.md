# Trump Doesn't Know If He Has To Uphold U.S. Constitution?! - May 5, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw)
*  All right, welcome to the Young Turks, Jane Huger, Sharon Reed with you guys today. Sharon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=0.0s)]
*  is of course, TYT contributor you see throughout all of our shows, Damage Report, Indisputable, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=5.04s)]
*  you name it, but also one of the hosts of Rebel HQ. Sharon, good to see you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=9.84s)]
*  Good to see you too. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  All right, so I'm in a dour mood. The story, the rundown has lots of stories of racism and bigotry [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=17.04s)]
*  and things that were never supposed to happen again happening. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=26.0s)]
*  And in the background, a low level hum of the American robbery continues. So we're going to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=28.88s)]
*  tell you about how the Republicans are planning to rob us. Trump is unhinged as usual. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=35.92s)]
*  And so it's a heavy show and Sharon, we're gonna start with the heaviest of stories. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=42.72s)]
*  So- Yeah, you got it, Cenk. The Gaza takeover, things are not coming to an end over there, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=47.04s)]
*  not the way people might want it to be. Israel's security cabinet has just voted to expand the war [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=54.96s)]
*  in Gaza. Yaddaf is now set to occupy the Gaza Strip for an indefinite amount of time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=61.28s)]
*  They also plan to carry out a large scale evacuation, Palestinians into the south. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=67.28s)]
*  A lot of details to cover, a lot still unfolding. But Cenk, before we get any further, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=75.92s)]
*  initial thoughts on this one, you said heavy, this checks that box. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=81.28s)]
*  Yeah, so we're in the third month of Israel's starvation campaign against Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  They're literally starving the people of Gaza to death, including the children. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=91.84s)]
*  This is collective punishment. And now, as you're gonna hear in the details of the story, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=95.68s)]
*  they are announcing their plans proudly to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians and drive [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=101.44s)]
*  them all out of Gaza and take the entire Gaza Strip for themselves. That's exactly what we [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=107.28s)]
*  told you they would do. In fact, we've got a poll up. And because there's still tons and tons of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=113.04s)]
*  leftovers of folks who are saying no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they just happened to stumble into [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=117.52s)]
*  taking all the land. That was not the plan all along. But there was nothing we could do. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=122.64s)]
*  We had to murder 52,000 people in there. We had to not even give a damn about the hostages. By the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=128.16s)]
*  way, the hostages are also starving to death right now. We had to take all of their land. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=133.28s)]
*  Golly gee, we just had to do it. The Palestinians made us murder their children. They made us do it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=140.08s)]
*  We had no agency, no control at all. So we're asking you guys, I'm curious what you guys are [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=146.08s)]
*  gonna say. You don't have to be a member to vote at TYT.com. You just take 10 seconds to register [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=152.48s)]
*  on the website so that we know you're a real person. Do you think the Israeli government has [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=157.84s)]
*  a planning to take Gaza all along? And I'm sure that tons of people are gonna say no, no, no, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=162.56s)]
*  no, no, it's just an accident. Golly gee, did we wind up stealing all of their land after murdering [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=167.28s)]
*  at least 52,000 people there, including at least 15,000 children? Did we accidentally starve them [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=174.48s)]
*  to death? If you starve someone to death, how can you claim you're not a terrorist? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=182.08s)]
*  Did you, how could it be collateral damage if you purposely starve a child to death? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=187.2s)]
*  But anyway, let's answer all these questions because now as Sharon's gonna tell you, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=193.44s)]
*  they voted unanimously and they literally voted for ethnic cleansing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Literally, it is amazing. It's one of the most outrageous actions by a government I have ever [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  seen in my lifetime. Go ahead, Sharon. Here's what we know about the IDF's plan so far. Again, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=211.28s)]
*  as Cenk said, announcing it. The war plan approved Monday includes conquering the strip, holding the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=218.8s)]
*  territory, according to an Israeli official, Wall Street Journal contributing to the reporting. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=224.32s)]
*  Palestinian civilians will be moved during the powerful new operation in Gaza. Netanyahu said [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=229.36s)]
*  in a video posted on social media, adding that his forces would not launch raids inside the enclave [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=235.6s)]
*  and then retreat. Senior Israeli security officials stated that unlike in the past, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=241.28s)]
*  the military will remain in every area it secures to prevent the return of terror. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=247.68s)]
*  That is the justification for it, they say. An Israeli government spokesperson stated that the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=254.96s)]
*  plan would not involve a permanent occupation of Gaza. Plan was approved unanimously, as Cenk said, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=259.84s)]
*  by the Israeli security cabinet. Tens of thousands of reserve soldiers will be mobilized [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=267.6s)]
*  to carry out the operation. According to that same plan, Israel will be changing how aid [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=273.36s)]
*  will be distributed inside the Gaza Strip. And when Israel lifts the blockade on humanitarian aid, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=280.56s)]
*  which has now entered into its third month, six to 10, and distribution sites, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  aid distribution sites rather will be established. They will be based in the southern portion of the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  Gaza Strip and they will be guarded by US private security contractors. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=300.56s)]
*  Humanitarian groups have spoken out against the change, stating it gives Israel too much control [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  over the flow of aid. It remains to be seen when aid will be allowed back into Gaza, according to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=313.36s)]
*  a statement from a senior Israeli security official there is this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=321.2s)]
*  The humanitarian blockade will continue and only later, after the operational phase begins and a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=325.92s)]
*  large scale civilian evacuation to the south is completed, will a humanitarian plan be implemented. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=333.68s)]
*  The national security minister, not only arguing for the blockade to continue, but also calling [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=342.64s)]
*  for the IDF to bomb food warehouses and generators. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotri, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=348.48s)]
*  calling for the occupation of Gaza. Both he and Netanyahu have been promoting [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=357.36s)]
*  President Donald Trump's plan to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=360.72s)]
*  Others in Israel are speaking out against the escalation of the war. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=366.72s)]
*  Inav Zangwaker, whose son, Matan, is being held hostage spoke at a Nasset community meeting Monday, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=370.16s)]
*  calling on soldiers not to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons, the AP reported. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  The Hostage Families Forum headquarters said in a statement this, expansion of military operations [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  puts every hostage at grave risk. It also threatens the lives of our soldiers, deepens the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=392.88s)]
*  toll on countless Israeli families already carrying the burden of this war. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=399.04s)]
*  According to the Israeli government, the ground war will be expanded slowly at first. That's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  because Trump will be in the Middle East later this month in order to work towards a ceasefire. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=410.32s)]
*  If those negotiations fail, then the Israeli military will rapidly escalate its operations. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  Netanyahu has claimed that the goal is to rescue the remaining hostages and eradicate Hamas. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=421.36s)]
*  Let's remember what Antony Blinken had to say about Hamas last January after over a year [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=428.32s)]
*  of fighting in that region. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=434.08s)]
*  We've long made the point to the Israeli government that Hamas cannot be defeated by [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=435.35999999999996s)]
*  a military campaign alone. That without a clear alternative, a post-conflict plan, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=440.88s)]
*  an incredible political horizon for the Palestinians, Hamas, or something just as [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=446.0s)]
*  important and dangerous, will grow back. That's exactly what's happened in northern [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  Gaza since October 7th. Each time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=456.0s)]
*  Hamas militants regroup and reemerge because there's nothing else to fill the void. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=461.76s)]
*  Indeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=467.52s)]
*  So Antony Blinken, Cenk, basically saying that what you're doing is creating and strengthening, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=473.04s)]
*  if you will, for the future Hamas. Do we believe any of this? Netanyahu wants the hostages. Netanyahu [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=483.36s)]
*  just wants to eradicate Hamas. Netanyahu wants to safely secure Gaza. These people, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  Palestinians, are being temporarily relocated. Did he sign off on this or does he even care [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=496.48s)]
*  about the little details? Yeah, look at the Trump too. All right, first of all, Anthony Blinken, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=505.20000000000005s)]
*  as a paid spokesperson for the Israeli government, his lobbying group appears to be working with the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=510.32000000000005s)]
*  Israelis. Now, everything is secretive because they don't want to tell you that our secretary [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=517.28s)]
*  state actually worked for Israel. But it doesn't really matter. Both of our presidents, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=522.56s)]
*  both Biden and Trump, both work for Israel. If you're saying the money has not affected them, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=526.7199999999999s)]
*  you can say that, but you sound absolutely asinine. Yeah, Miriam Adelson and Sheldon [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=532.4s)]
*  Adelson gave Trump $337 million, but Trump is such a good guy, it didn't affect him. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, I dare you to say that. I dare you to make it complete and utter ass of yourself. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=543.1199999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden got more money from AIPAC than any other donor in his career. But go ahead, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  tell me Joe Biden doesn't care about the money. He's such an angel, he just only looks out for [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=553.76s)]
*  others, right? He wouldn't do anything selfish at all, like run for president when he has dementia. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  Okay, and it doesn't matter. These guys are all paid and everyone who now denies that they're paid [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=563.3599999999999s)]
*  by Israel, even though we literally have the receipts of AIPAC being the number one donor [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=568.16s)]
*  in this election cycle. You're lying on behalf of Israel, you're doing propaganda on behalf of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=573.76s)]
*  Israel. You can say anything you want about what you think you're doing. You're definitely [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=579.5999999999999s)]
*  not doing journalism. You're purposely lying if you don't point out that our government is [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=583.3599999999999s)]
*  obviously owned by Israel, obviously. So go ahead, you liars in mainstream media, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=588.64s)]
*  pretend that, golly gee, the politicians got 500 million from AIPAC, but they're such angels. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=594.8s)]
*  They'd never be affected by that money, it would never influence them. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=601.04s)]
*  Okay, all right, so we're past that. So now next thing is, they say, well, okay, we weren't gonna [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=604.56s)]
*  take the land, but the Palestinians made us do it. We weren't gonna starve them, but they made us do [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  it. Okay, so they had all these things about like, well, okay, human shields and it's not our fault, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  Hamas was there. And so we had to kill everyone near Hamas and we killed 52,000 people at a [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=623.76s)]
*  bare bare minimum, 120,000 injured kid, destroyed 90% of the buildings in Gaza. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=630.88s)]
*  And there was collateral damage? When we destroyed 90% of the buildings in Gaza, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=636.48s)]
*  there was collateral damage. Golly gee, we didn't mean it. We didn't intend to do terrorism. No, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=641.12s)]
*  you intended to murder those people and you murdered them and that is terrorism. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=646.4s)]
*  You intended to starve the Palestinians, that they also blocked all medicine going in and all the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=650.96s)]
*  people who died, including the kids who died because they couldn't get their medicine, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=655.76s)]
*  were Israel intended to murder them and Israel did murder them. I know for some people here in [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=659.04s)]
*  America, they say, no, that's offensive, Cenk. And you hurting my feelings is so much more [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=665.52s)]
*  important than the lives of those babies. So what? Yeah, Israel dropped a bomb and they lit [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=670.48s)]
*  those babies on fire. Yeah, Israel starved those babies to death, but their lives are not important, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  Cenk. They're stupid Muslims like you, so they don't count at all. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=682.48s)]
*  Only we count, only we count. So we're allowed to starve everyone, we're allowed to murder, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=686.9599999999999s)]
*  we're allowed to steal their land and announce it. Now we're proudly announcing it. Yes, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=693.76s)]
*  we're going to conquer Gaza. Yes, we're gonna take, and what do you think the Palestinians are gonna [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=697.92s)]
*  know? If you don't know the definition of ethnic cleansing, it is to target a specific ethnic group [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=701.76s)]
*  like the Palestinians and drive them from their land. Now, I would know a thing or two about this [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=706.24s)]
*  because the Turks did the Armenian genocide. And that's what the Armenian genocide was. You [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=710.0s)]
*  drive people from their land and that's called ethnic cleansing and that's called a genocide. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=713.84s)]
*  You see how I can be Turkish and still say that and not say to people who point out accurately [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=718.72s)]
*  that the Armenian genocide happened. You're all 80 Turkish. Turks didn't do anything wrong. You [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=726.0s)]
*  offended me. That's 10,000 times more important than some Armenians that died. That's what it [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=731.44s)]
*  sounds like when Israeli supporters say, who cares that we're starving your children to death? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=737.5200000000001s)]
*  Our feelings are so much more important than your children. They're just Muslims, practically [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  worthless. But by the way, you're offending me. I'm not offending you by saying your babies are [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=752.1600000000001s)]
*  worthless and I will slaughter them. But you are offending me by pointing out that I am in fact [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=757.2800000000001s)]
*  doing that. I am in fact supporting that. Okay, so look, please have the decency to just, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=764.4s)]
*  if you're in that camp, by the way, do not make assumptions about religion. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=772.48s)]
*  Some of the best fighters we have for peace and for two states, for everyone to get along, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=776.24s)]
*  are Jewish Americans, as some folks in Israel, okay? Again, Brave New Films, great movie about [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=782.24s)]
*  Palestinian journalists murdered by Israel. You should check that out. We'll have the link in the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=790.08s)]
*  description box. Robert Greenwald is an angel. Glenn Greenwald, Dave Smith, I can name it, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=794.4000000000001s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, tons of wonderful Jewish American brothers and sisters doing exactly the right [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=800.0s)]
*  thing. And they see what we see. But unfortunately, there are many still Israeli supporters who say, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=804.96s)]
*  never again, I meant for us. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=814.24s)]
*  You Muslims can go pound sand. Of course we're gonna do it to you. Who cares about you? I need [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=816.2399999999999s)]
*  your land. Give me your goddamn land, okay? Never again. No, BS, you never meant it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=822.0s)]
*  If you're still supporting Israel starving those kids to death, you never meant a word of it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=828.2399999999999s)]
*  You just meant me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=833.28s)]
*  give me everything and slaughter everyone else. Who cares? They're not me. Be honest, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=837.3599999999999s)]
*  have the decency to be honest and never ever utter the words never again. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=842.64s)]
*  So I can't take it. I can't take the hypocrisy. I can't take the lies. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=848.96s)]
*  Seeing those kids dying every single day as the supporters of Israel dance. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=853.76s)]
*  So what? It's all the Palestinians fault. Get the f out of here. Jesus Christ. Do you have a shred [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=860.56s)]
*  of decency in humanity? A shred of decency in humanity. And if you haven't spoken out [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=867.92s)]
*  against what Israel's doing now, and now all of a sudden you turn around after saying, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=872.8s)]
*  you jank, you sing, they're gonna take the land. Antisemitic. Now they're saying, yeah, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna take the land. Okay, so you were wrong. Are you gonna have any decency and admit that you [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=882.7199999999999s)]
*  were wrong? Admit that they meant to steal the goddamn land in the first place. This never had [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=889.8399999999999s)]
*  anything to do with self-defense. Are you going to admit that? If you're not going to admit that, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=894.32s)]
*  then shut up. Never talk about any crime against humanity again. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=900.4000000000001s)]
*  You can't do a crime against humanity, right? It's not in the past. It's not in the past. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=906.5600000000001s)]
*  Again, if you are supporting the current genocide in Gaza, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=912.1600000000001s)]
*  then you love crimes against humanity. You just don't want it to happen to you. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=918.32s)]
*  But you're very, very happy if it happens to others. The decency of honesty is all I'm asking [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=922.08s)]
*  for. Look, and for all the people, we all finance this, guys. We're literally taking money out of [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=929.0400000000001s)]
*  our paychecks. Every single person watching, they've taken money out of your paycheck [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  to murder those people and to steal their land. They took it out of my check too. I paid for that [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=942.5600000000001s)]
*  genocide. I paid for that ethnic cleansing. Our corrupt, sick politicians, here, I'm gonna go [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=947.52s)]
*  to that right now. I wanna show you some monsters, some terrorists. Let's go to Randy Fine. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=956.48s)]
*  So Rashida Tlaib says, hey, you're starving Palestinians to death. This guy says, this is [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=962.56s)]
*  representative Andy Fine. Tell your fellow Muslim terrorists to release the hostages and surrender. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=969.68s)]
*  Until then, hashtag starve away. Congressman Fine, you are a terrorist. You're a terrorist. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=975.44s)]
*  And your face is gonna go in a future Holocaust museum, future genocide museum. The people who [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=987.0400000000001s)]
*  celebrated the starvation of the Palestinian children and Randy Fine's picture is gonna be [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  up there. What a monster. What a despicable human being. And speaking of despicable human beings, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=999.84s)]
*  the mentally damaged senator from Pennsylvania, John Fetterman. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1006.32s)]
*  Okay, look, I said the other day, I have some sympathy for him because apparently the stroke [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1010.0s)]
*  gave him massive brain damage. And if you have massive brain damage, you'd be in favor of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1013.76s)]
*  genocide. That makes sense. So here he is saying, this is not enough. He says we should bomb Iran [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1018.1600000000001s)]
*  and start a bigger war. Why? Because his handlers, or as Tom Massey calls them, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1023.44s)]
*  his babysitters for Israel that track literally every single congressperson according to Tom Massey. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1028.56s)]
*  There's an Israeli handler for every single congressperson in America. I didn't say that, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1035.92s)]
*  Representative Massey did. So his handler told him, shut up, John, and order a war against Iran. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1041.92s)]
*  Make America's pay for it. Make America's fight it. And Fetterman is like, yes, sir, of course, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1048.96s)]
*  sir. And he writes, we cannot negotiate with Iran. It's time to destroy their nuclear program and [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1054.48s)]
*  neutralize their remaining capabilities of its proxies. I remain steadfast with Israel, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1060.56s)]
*  provide whatever is necessary to carry this out. The senator from Israel has weighed in and saying [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1065.92s)]
*  that we should murder more people in the Middle East. And later, after we murder all those Muslims, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1071.8400000000001s)]
*  they'll come back around and say, well, the Muslim lives are worthless, worthless. Of course, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1077.44s)]
*  we slaughtered their children. Their children are irrelevant. They're not human. So we slaughtered [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1081.76s)]
*  all of them. We made America pay it. And you know what? Golly gee, never again. I guess they'll laugh. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  Never again. So this does not apply to anyone that does not support Israel right now [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1099.12s)]
*  as they carry out the continued slaughter in Gaza, the stealing of Gaza's land, and the starvation [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1106.4s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. If you don't agree with that, none of this applies to you. If you do agree [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1111.52s)]
*  with this, it definitely applies to you. And it is inarguable. And you are not a good person. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1115.76s)]
*  If you say slaughter them and starve their children, I'm good with it. Under no circumstances are you a [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1122.96s)]
*  good person. Okay, I think I made myself clear. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1131.04s)]
*  There are [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1138.64s)]
*  catnip. Others are doing their part to fight for justice. Director Robert Greenwald has just [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1154.5600000000002s)]
*  released the trailer for his upcoming film, Gaza Journalists Under Fire. We want to show you this [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1161.2s)]
*  excerpt. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1166.08s)]
*  Such a massacre against journalists in such a short period of time is unprecedented. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1186.24s)]
*  The [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1190.48s)]
*  journalists have been deliberately targeted. That would constitute a war crime. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1193.36s)]
*  Since no foreign journalists are allowed in unless they are embedded with the Israeli army, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1201.4399999999998s)]
*  these local journalists are the eyes and ears of the world. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1205.4399999999998s)]
*  It's more truth. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1220.8799999999999s)]
*  Cenk, here's the thing. I know everything that you told us and what that film shows is the truth. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1222.8s)]
*  You've told us the truth about US politicians, US presidents, Netanyahu, the IDF, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1231.04s)]
*  APAC, and everything you said is true. And it's enraging. And your passion is palpable and needs [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1240.32s)]
*  to be. It's necessary. But then I think what the hell can we do about it? You have the war crimes, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1249.36s)]
*  the warrants for Netanyahu and his former defense minister. Nothing's going to be done. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1257.04s)]
*  What the hell? You talked about two camps, the camp who says genocide's okay with them [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1264.3999999999999s)]
*  and the rest of us. What the hell can ever be done about this? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1271.52s)]
*  Yeah, let me tell you one other terrible thing and then I'll tell you the only sense of people [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1276.56s)]
*  who could possibly stop it. So in the Wall Street Journal, I don't want you to gloss over this. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1280.56s)]
*  Donald Trump said something BS today about how no more will protect the Palestinians. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1286.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he needs to protect them as we remove them, as we kill them. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1291.2s)]
*  Where are you moving them to? You're gonna move them to the Sinai desert, right? Where they'll [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1294.88s)]
*  have to live in tents the rest of their lives as refugees. So again, definition of ethnic cleansing. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1298.32s)]
*  So in reality, what's happening is we go to the Wall Street Journal. Israel's cabinet on [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1302.88s)]
*  Monday also approved a plan to resume aid to Gaza by setting up six to 10 aid distribution sites. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1306.8000000000002s)]
*  That would be protected by private US security contractors. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1312.3200000000002s)]
*  So it turns out, of course, it is going to be us. Now they get to say, no, it's okay. It's a [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1318.96s)]
*  private contractor. So Israel paid them, but don't worry, it's not gonna be Israelis that die [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1324.0s)]
*  removing the Palestinians from Gaza. It's gonna be Americans for a price. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1330.56s)]
*  We told you it was gonna be Americans. Israeli lives are more precious than all other lives on [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1337.2s)]
*  the planet combined, according to supporters of Israel. So they're like, well, of course, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1343.12s)]
*  we're gonna kill the Palestinians at a disproportionate rate. Hamas killed 36 of our [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1347.68s)]
*  kids. We've already killed 15 to 20,000 of their kids. And obviously, because their lives are [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1352.0s)]
*  worthless, the 36 kids are worth a billion Muslim kids. Muslim kids are worthless, okay? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1356.4s)]
*  And then on top of that, now we're not gonna drive out the Palestinians ourselves. That would [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1361.76s)]
*  get a lot of Israelis killed, and their one life is worth a billion of any other life. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1367.2800000000002s)]
*  So hey, stupid Americans, come in here and clean up our mess. Here, we'll give you some money. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  Where did we get the money? We got it from you, bunch of suckers. Israel's taken $300 billion [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1376.24s)]
*  from the US over the lifetime of Israel, adjusted for inflation. They get blank check after blank [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1382.32s)]
*  check. You remember how Trump canceled all foreign aid asterisks, except he didn't. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1389.12s)]
*  The only foreign aid that wasn't canceled for Israel and Egypt, which is Israel's ally in a [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1393.52s)]
*  peace treaty. So Israel's still taking the money. Biden gave him a blank check. Trump is gonna give [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1398.0s)]
*  him a blank check, has already done so. And we will pay for US security contractors to go get killed [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1402.96s)]

*  So these are the things that are actually happening in the real world. And I try not [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1416.3200000000002s)]

*  I think America should stop funding Israel. And when I said never again, I meant never again. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1449.6s)]
*  I don't mean go do it to Palestinian kids. Under my name, you're calling this a Jewish state? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1455.44s)]
*  When these right wing fascist monsters have taken control over it, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1461.04s)]
*  it they should be saying, this is not the Israel I love. It's not that hard. They always say, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1466.24s)]
*  no, no, no, you can't put pressure on anybody. Nope, nope, nope, anti-Semitic or whatever the [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1472.8799999999999s)]

*  But no, you can't ask supporters of Israel to ever do that. No, they can send endless money. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1494.88s)]
*  And they could force America to do this. And yes, your donations, brothers and sisters, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1500.88s)]
*  a lot of you might not realize it. But your donations are then being used to literally, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1505.2800000000002s)]

*  was doing with the occupation was brutal and terrible, right? But I wanted two states and I [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1529.6000000000001s)]
*  want Israel to be safe and I want Palestine to be safe and independent and free. I want them both [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1534.4s)]

*  surprised that anti-Semitism is on the rise? I hate anti-Semitism. I got Jewish family and I got [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1550.96s)]
*  nothing but Jewish friends. And so I don't want them harassed. That's terrible. It's terrible. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1557.92s)]
*  Look at what happened to Portnoy today. We're gonna talk about it later in the show, okay? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1564.08s)]
*  But if the Turks are chopping up Kurds on TV and then people start hating the Turks, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1568.32s)]
*  I'm not gonna be like, I don't know why it happened. I'm so surprised. Well, that's because we lit the [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=1574.88s)]

*  whose deportation your administration called an administrative error. You said in a recent [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2070.4s)]
*  interview you could bring him back, but you won't. Are you defying the Supreme Court? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2074.88s)]
*  No, I'm relying on the Attorney General of the United States, Pam Bondi, who's very capable, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2079.84s)]
*  doing a great job. Because I'm not involved in the legality or the illegality. I have lawyers [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2085.28s)]
*  to do that. And that's why I have a great DOJ. We have a great one. We had a very corrupt one [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2091.84s)]
*  before. Now we have a great one. And they're not viewing the decision the way you said it. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2097.52s)]
*  They don't view it that way at all. They think it's a totally different decision. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2103.28s)]
*  They're into alternative facts. And I think Trump is right. Pam Bondi is doing a great job. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2108.88s)]
*  She's doing a great job of backing everything he wants her to do, being the perfect wingman, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2113.92s)]
*  wingwoman. It's just incredible that he's just saying all this out loud. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2119.52s)]
*  And there are still some of my mega Republican friends who are still saying it. He's just trolling. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2124.16s)]
*  It's just, that's Trump. And he's actually doing it too. We just cannot seem to get to these [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2133.3599999999997s)]
*  intellectually honest conversations. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2139.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. And so here's another excuse they'll use. Well, later he said he'd listen to [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2141.68s)]
*  the courts, except she asked them, the Supreme Court ruled nine to nothing to quote unquote, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2149.36s)]
*  bring him back. Well, I don't know. Well, then so you're not listening to the courts. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2154.32s)]
*  So when someone asks you and you're the president, will you uphold the Constitution? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2160.48s)]
*  The correct answer is not I don't know, which is literally what he said. The correct answer is yes. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2165.6800000000003s)]
*  If you say, hey, listen, there's parts of the Constitution I don't love and I want to propose [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2172.32s)]
*  an amendment and we gotta get two thirds of Congress to approve our states, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2177.44s)]
*  to call for a convention and then three quarters of states to confirm. No problem, no problem. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2180.88s)]
*  It's a perfectly good, healthy amendment process. If you say, yeah, Supreme Court ruled nine to [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2184.96s)]
*  nothing, but did they? Pam Bundy says that it's the opposite of what they said. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2189.84s)]
*  Okay, I know George Orwell was a prophet, we understand that. But they said bring him back [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2196.2400000000002s)]
*  and you must follow due process. And you're saying I'm not gonna follow due process and [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2202.48s)]
*  I'm not going to bring him back. And you see how I'm listening to the Supreme Court. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2206.48s)]
*  No, I see how George Orwell was right. And you're a giant liar and you never cared about the [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2210.72s)]
*  Constitution. And how do we know that? I told you before the election, he literally wrote [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2216.32s)]
*  after 2020, we should terminate the Constitution because of massive fruit against me. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2222.56s)]
*  There was no fraud against him. He went to court 61. Why do you think he won't listen to the courts? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2228.64s)]
*  He went to court 61 times to prove that he won the 2020 election. He presented a total sum of [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2231.92s)]
*  zero evidence in all those trials. He lost every trial, including to Republican judges [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2237.44s)]
*  and Trump appointed judges. And that's why he doesn't wanna listen to the courts, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2242.64s)]
*  cuz the courts are where you have to present evidence. And Donald Trump has never had any [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2246.48s)]
*  evidence in his entire goddamn life for anything, for anything. He's an obvious huckster and a fraud [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2250.08s)]
*  and a con man. It's so obvious. And I'm trying to snap some people out of it, some, I know, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2256.96s)]
*  hardcore MAGA, a billion excuses. He'll come over and come to your house and sleep with your wife [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2263.04s)]
*  and you'll go, you did me a great favor, I'll buy your meme coin. Okay, those guys are hopeless. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2269.12s)]
*  Go ahead, okay? Give him your money, give him your wife, give him whatever you want, okay? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2274.4s)]
*  But independents and some portion of MAGA that actually thought he was gonna uphold the [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2278.32s)]
*  constitution. He just told you he's not going to. Go ahead, make more excuses. Now, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2282.56s)]
*  let's go to how unhinged this guy is, cuz I also wanna ask you guys, are you okay? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2287.36s)]
*  Remember, Shannon, I distinctly remember every Trump supporter telling us how anti-war they were. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2291.12s)]
*  No way war, no way. So I wanna show you Kristen Welker asked about Greenland. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2298.7999999999997s)]
*  Let's watch the anti-war president, watch. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2303.84s)]
*  That's- You and I talked and I asked you if you would rule out military force to take Greenland, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2307.2s)]
*  and you said no, you don't rule out anything. Would you rule out military force to take Canada? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2314.0s)]
*  Well, I think we're not gonna ever get to that point. It could happen, something could happen [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2318.48s)]
*  with Greenland, I'll be honest, we need that for national and international security. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2323.4399999999996s)]
*  But not with Canada? But I think it's highly unlikely. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2328.08s)]
*  I don't see it with Canada, I just don't see it, I have to be honest with you. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2330.56s)]
*  But you are not ruling out military force to take Greenland. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2334.08s)]
*  I don't rule it out, I don't say I'm gonna do it, but I don't rule out anything, no, not there. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2338.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay, Sharon, we're gonna invade it, apparently he wants to potentially invade Mexico as well. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2344.56s)]
*  We'll get that in one second. But if I was president and I ran on an anti-war platform, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2350.08s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that I would rule out invading Greenland. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2357.7599999999998s)]
*  Am I the crazy one, Sharon, or does that not sound anti-war? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2364.56s)]
*  That's you, that's you, that's not him, okay? And tomorrow he may say something different, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2370.56s)]
*  although he's been pretty consistent about this Greenland situation and that military force [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2375.6s)]
*  belongs on the table. You mentioned Mexico, the president, Claudia Shambon, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2381.12s)]
*  revealed over the weekend that Trump pressured her to allow American troops [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2386.7999999999997s)]
*  into her country to fight the cartels. Here's the statement, he said, how can we help you [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2390.4799999999996s)]
*  fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2397.04s)]
*  And you know what I said to him? No, President Trump, sovereignty is not for sale. Sovereignty [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2402.0s)]
*  is love and defendant. White House National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2410.8s)]
*  effectively confirmed that this happened. Yeah, saying, president has been crystal clear that [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2417.1200000000003s)]
*  Mexico must do more to combat these gangs and cartels. And the United States stands ready to [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2423.28s)]
*  assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries. I mean, this guy, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2429.44s)]
*  this Trump jank doesn't think he's king of America. He thinks he's king of the world. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2436.8s)]
*  He can do whatever he wants to, whomever, wherever. He believes he's actually [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2442.5600000000004s)]
*  king of the world. No wonder he put out the meme, the AI doctored photo of him as the pontiff as [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2449.6800000000003s)]
*  well. I mean, he actually believes he can do this and he has all of our resources and money. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2456.32s)]
*  I mean, he's stolen it all. Is he willing to spend some of it on war? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2461.76s)]
*  Yeah, so later we'll tell you about his corruption and how he's funneling money into World Liberty [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2466.4s)]
*  Financial. And some of the Gulf countries, the Arab countries are giving him $2 billion [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2472.32s)]
*  at a time. I mean, the corruption is so through the roof. To be fair, at least for Mexico, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2479.28s)]
*  it wasn't an involuntary invasion. He offered to invade them. He said, we could bring our military [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2485.28s)]
*  into your country and occupy you. Would you like that? And surprisingly, they said no. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2491.36s)]
*  Okay, so at least he asked. We're fair. Has he invaded Greenland yet? No. Is he threatening [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2496.4s)]
*  the invading Greenland? Yes, you just saw it. He said, that's an option. It's an option to invade [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2502.8s)]
*  Greenland. And you know what a lot of, again, hardcore magr guys will say is, yeah, we voted [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2509.1200000000003s)]
*  for this. Brother, you might have voted for this, but the outer edge of his voters voted on inflation [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2514.5600000000004s)]
*  and immigration. They didn't vote to invade Greenland. Did Trump say before the election, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2519.68s)]
*  hey guys, I'm anti-war, but if you elect me, I might invade Greenland. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2524.24s)]
*  And I might use US troops to ethnically cleanse Gaza, and I'm not gonna uphold the Constitution. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2528.64s)]
*  And if the Supreme Court rules against me, nine nothing, I'm gonna ignore them. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2535.7599999999998s)]
*  Did he say those things? No, he didn't say any of those things. So no, they didn't vote for this. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2539.44s)]
*  I told him he was a madman. Unfortunately, not enough people listened, but he's a madman. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2544.72s)]
*  He's been a madman this entire time. So now we gotta bear through this for another three, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2549.68s)]
*  four years. And yes, my friends on the left, that's why I told you to get Biden out of the [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2554.48s)]
*  goddamn race. We ran against the madman, and then madman wins, and you're like, well, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2558.64s)]
*  I couldn't have seen that coming. Except we all saw it coming. The guy was shaking hands [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2564.96s)]
*  with invisible people, and we're like, please take him out of the race. Please run a strong candidate. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2569.04s)]
*  Democrats are like, nope, nope, we obey, we obey. Joe Biden is young and dynamic. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2574.16s)]
*  Joe Biden is young and dynamic. Okay, so here we are, young and dynamic. I can't believe young and [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2578.96s)]
*  dynamic couldn't complete a sentence in a national debate. Shocking, that's the next story. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2584.3199999999997s)]
*  The Democrats are still pretending to be shocked. Please give them an alternative, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2588.88s)]
*  something decent that they could vote for, so they stop voting for a madman. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2594.0s)]
*  I'm not asking for too much. All right, we gotta go, otherwise we'll never get to the rest of the [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2598.48s)]
*  story. Sorry, all right, we're gonna take a quick break when we come back. The disaster of the [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2604.4s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2611.2000000000003s)]
*  All right, back on TYT. Cenk and Sharon with you guys and also Curtis McLaurs. Curtis, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2627.84s)]
*  thanks for signing up, brother. He hit the join button below on YouTube. You can do likewise, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2635.36s)]

*  what's next? Some people don't like the words cover up, Cenk, but it's still a cover up, watch. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2643.76s)]
*  I think there's a consensus that the media generously missed and ungenerously covered up [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2649.6s)]
*  Joe Biden's frailty. I think cover up is such a loaded phrase. People use that term as they [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2659.2s)]
*  relate to Watergate or the covering up of not sharing public information about a war. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2664.24s)]
*  I'm not accusing anybody of a crime. I understand, but other people have used that term and I think [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2669.7599999999998s)]
*  it's a bit of a dangerous term. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2673.84s)]
*  Or it's dead on. Last week, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki objected to the word [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2675.28s)]
*  cover up. Might imagine she would when it comes to the media's coverage of Joe Biden's mental [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2683.1200000000003s)]
*  decline or lack thereof. And just a minute, we will play a clip of Psaki insisting that she did [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2688.32s)]
*  not know about what was going on with Biden. I think I know the answer, but I'll ask the [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2696.2400000000002s)]
*  question anyway, should we believe her? So here's the thing, Sharon, folks put [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2701.76s)]
*  us in a difficult position, right? So I don't wanna say that Jen Psaki's a liar [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2707.76s)]
*  because it's awkward, it's uncomfortable. She's a human being and she's gonna [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2713.44s)]
*  get hurt over that, etc., right? But they put us in an untenable position. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2718.2400000000002s)]
*  What do you want me to say? Really, you guys, none of you saw it in your day to day interactions [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2722.88s)]
*  with Joe Biden when we saw it here from the outside. When he shook hands with an invisible [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2728.24s)]
*  person on stage, Jen, did you ask anyone, hey, was there anyone there and I just didn't see them on [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2734.64s)]
*  date? What was going on? Or did you think, yeah, the president's obviously in mental decline, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2740.72s)]
*  let's go lie, okay? When he couldn't, you're telling me the first time you noticed that he [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2747.12s)]
*  couldn't finish his sentences were during the debate. How come we played a thousand tapes here [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2752.72s)]
*  on the Young Turks? Cuz we actually wanted a strong candidate against Trump. We actually [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2758.0s)]
*  thought democracy was on the line and we were right. But Jen thought that protecting her boss [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2761.84s)]
*  and her own job and her own prestige and reputation was way more important than democracy, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2768.0s)]
*  way more important. Are you really telling me that you never saw Biden have a verbal gaffe [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2774.0s)]
*  behind the scenes as we saw him have a million verbal, not gaffes, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2779.6s)]
*  like literally can't finish a sentence we don't know what he's talking about. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2784.64s)]
*  We saw it with our own eyes on air, but you're saying that when you went back into the White House, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2788.64s)]
*  all of a sudden you went from, hey Jen, let's do this and here's my action plan, etc. Why? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2794.64s)]
*  Why would he do that? Why would he fake having dementia on air when he was perfectly fine off [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2802.64s)]
*  air? But you expect us to believe all that. And then when I say I think Jen Psaki might be lying, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2808.24s)]
*  I'm the bad guy. And all of Washington was like, now have you not only offended Joe Biden, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2814.8799999999997s)]
*  you've offended Jen Psaki. And Jen Psaki is still a very important person in Washington. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2821.12s)]
*  And her feelings are so much more important than Democrats winning an election, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2828.4799999999996s)]
*  people being honest with you. The press, come on, the press didn't cover it up. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2834.8s)]
*  All right, let's hear the rest of the story and then let's all make our own conclusions about [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2841.6800000000003s)]
*  whether the press covered it up or not. Go ahead, Sharon. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2845.76s)]
*  Sockie's comments came on the mixed signals podcast by Seema4, which is hosted by [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2848.32s)]
*  Max Taney and Ben Smith. Here's that clip of Jen Psaki stating that she did not see Biden's decline. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2854.0800000000004s)]
*  I left in May of 2022 just for the facts here. And I have seen Biden once since then. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2860.48s)]
*  I never saw that person, not a single time, and I was in the Oval Office every day [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2868.56s)]
*  that was on that debate stage. I'm not a doctor, aging happens quite quickly. Were things that [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2874.16s)]
*  people saw during that period of time that were similar to that or would have been in a category [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2879.6s)]
*  of that? I don't know, possibly, right? And all these books are gonna tell us. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2884.2400000000002s)]
*  She's either the smartest Washington insider or she just has no clue what's going on around her. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2887.36s)]
*  According to the Wall Street Journal, Biden's decline was apparent almost as soon as his term [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2894.88s)]
*  began. A sign that the bruising presidential schedule needed to be adjusted for Biden's [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2898.88s)]
*  advanced age had arisen early on, just the first few months of his term. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2904.48s)]
*  Administration officials noticed the president became tired if meetings went long and would make [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2909.04s)]
*  mistakes. They issued a directive to some powerful lawmakers and allies seeking [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2914.16s)]
*  one-on-one time. The exchanges should be short and focused, according to people who received [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2919.2799999999997s)]
*  the message directly from White House aides. Ideally, the meetings would start later in the [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2924.3999999999996s)]
*  day since Biden has never been at his best first thing in the morning, some of the people said. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2930.96s)]
*  The staff made these adjustments to limit potential missteps by Biden, the people said. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2936.96s)]
*  That aside, we do have more of the Seymour Ford podcast episode to show you. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2944.16s)]
*  One point Smith asked Saki if the media failed to cover Biden's decline properly. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2948.3199999999997s)]
*  Let's see how she responded to this one. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2953.68s)]
*  What I don't know, Ben, and maybe we'll learn from these books is what the facts were behind [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2956.64s)]
*  the scenes. So what the media missed and maybe the media missed a lot. And so maybe in retrospect, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2960.48s)]
*  which is always easier to be critical of the media about frankly, right? There were major [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2965.2s)]
*  stories and moments missed. What I think is challenging if you don't know about what's [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2970.4s)]
*  happening privately, right? Is that Joe Biden was, he was in his early 80s during that period of [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2976.32s)]
*  time. We all knew his age, that was not a secret. What was happening behind the scenes, I don't know. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2982.48s)]
*  What was also true that I would find actually a little tricky if you're a reporter of any kind, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2989.36s)]
*  is that while we know there were problematic things behind the scenes now in 23 and 24. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=2995.52s)]
*  There was an aggressive all out pitching operation from the right wing and from [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3000.88s)]
*  the Republicans about Joe Biden's age and how he was in decline and sleeping in the Oval Office. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3005.36s)]
*  A lot of which wasn't true. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3010.64s)]
*  She left in May 2022, so everything she's talking about speculating on is after she left. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3012.0s)]
*  Former NBC host Chuck Todd made similar comments last month. Let's check out what Chuck said. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3020.88s)]
*  This is not a media failure. This is a failure of the Democratic Party. And I just sort of the [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3025.52s)]
*  virtue signaling that some people have done to try to say that the media missed this story. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3032.0s)]
*  They didn't miss this story. I just refuse to accept this stupid premise because it's a right [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3037.92s)]
*  wing manufactured right wing premise in order to stain the media. The media has got plenty of things [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3042.8s)]
*  to attack them for. And there are MSNBC and CNN and pundits that absolutely carried water for Joe [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3047.7599999999998s)]
*  Biden. But they're not journalists. They're former strategists that carried water for Joe Biden. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3054.64s)]
*  The people at fault are Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3060.7999999999997s)]
*  Jill Biden, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, every elected member of Congress. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3064.3199999999997s)]
*  I guess Jen, for me, it's like, but who are they rubbing shoulders with all that time? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3069.04s)]
*  The Washington game, it's an insider game. Many of them are one in the same, it seems like. They [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3075.68s)]
*  lunch together, they chat offline or on signal together. With Jen Psaki, remember, even after [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3082.48s)]
*  she left the White House and her job there, her media superpower is supposedly she's got that [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3088.72s)]
*  direct line. She knows everything that's going on inside the building, but yet she doesn't see any [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3095.2s)]
*  of this. She doesn't know anything that went down here. As Joe Biden is falling over sandbags and [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3100.64s)]
*  falling off his bike, those could be, you could explain those things away. But the fact that [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3107.2s)]
*  Chuck Todd and Jen Psaki are so protective of this media bubble, this machine that works [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3112.24s)]
*  in concert with the party, it's sick. It's not, well, maybe it is as sick as the other side [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3119.9199999999996s)]
*  sometimes. I don't know, your thoughts. Yeah, it's a great point about her being an insider. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3126.4799999999996s)]
*  I'll come back to that. And it's also a great point what you just said. So Trump lies all the [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3131.2799999999997s)]
*  time, right? And we just did a huge segment about his lies a minute ago on the outteraks, right? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3136.3999999999996s)]
*  Watch the show live at 6 to 8 PM, you'll see it all, okay? Now, mainstream media, and Trump says, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3142.08s)]
*  don't believe your lying eyes. I said terminate the Constitution after I lost the last election, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3149.04s)]
*  but don't believe your lying eyes. I said I was anti-war, now I wanna invade Greenland, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3154.24s)]
*  but don't believe your lying eyes, okay? So now mainstream media comes in and tells us, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3158.24s)]
*  no, we held Biden accountable and we said that he was in mental decline. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3162.72s)]
*  Guys, we were right here. We saw it with our, no, you didn't, none of you said that. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3166.56s)]
*  None of you said that. But it's not just that, that whenever anyone did come out and say, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3171.04s)]
*  for example, forget people like us. Of course, the mainstream media would never dare to talk, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3175.92s)]
*  online media is saying that Biden is old. Geez, isn't he young and dynamic? Let's report that on [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3182.16s)]
*  air. But guys, are you really, do you think you're gonna gaslight us into thinking that you held him [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3189.6s)]
*  accountable when we all have eyes and ears and we saw that none of you held him accountable? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3196.0s)]
*  That in fact, forget us, like I said, when Robert Hur, you remember the lawyer who talked to Biden? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3201.68s)]
*  He came out and said, well, he's not guilty, but rather he's having trouble concentrating. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3207.2s)]
*  What happened? The media was like, okay, Robert Hur, no, the Democrats are right and [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3212.32s)]
*  Robert Hur is wrong, and he's a Republican plan. It was just Democrats who said it. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3217.44s)]
*  It was mainstream media. Mainstream media are the attack dogs, and not of Democrats, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3221.44s)]
*  of establishment politicians. If you're a corporate politician like Mitch McConnell or Joe Biden or [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3227.76s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi or Marco Rubio, mainstream media will kiss your ass from here to eternity. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3233.84s)]
*  And then again, proving George Orwell right, and then they'll turn around and go, no, he didn't. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3240.32s)]
*  No, man, we checked Joe Biden. Did you, Chuck? Did you? Show me. Show me you are going on air [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3245.2000000000003s)]
*  and say, what the hell's going on here? Here's one video, the next video, the third. We did it. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3252.56s)]
*  Did you do it, Chuck? Did you do it once, Chuck? If you didn't do it once, why don't you shut the [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3256.48s)]
*  F up? And put, the media, they blame the media. Brother, I've been on the air during the Iraq [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3262.4s)]
*  war. We've been around forever, oldest internet show in history. And back then we were on radio. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3270.08s)]
*  We were on the air and we were saying, Iraq didn't attack us. Iraq didn't attack us. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3276.88s)]
*  And all mainstream media was going, no, Dick Cheney says that they're in the general region [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3283.2799999999997s)]
*  from which the terrorists came. And seven out of 10 Americans on the day we invaded Iraq thought [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3287.44s)]
*  that Saddam Hussein had attacked us. Why? Mainstream media. Mainstream media helped [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3293.28s)]
*  Republicans lie us into that war 100%. And it's not like there weren't people like us [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3300.7200000000003s)]
*  screaming. They didn't attack us, you goddamn liars. They didn't attack us. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3308.1600000000003s)]
*  And now they say, no, we called out Biden. We were really tough on him. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3314.48s)]
*  Get that F, then show me, show me, show me. You can't show a single clip, can you? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3318.88s)]
*  Okay, so Chuck Todd, sorry, brother, sorry, but you're a giant liar. All you've ever done is cover [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3325.2s)]
*  up for politicians on the Republican and Democratic side. If they're a corporate establishment [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3331.84s)]
*  politician, you love them. You aided and abetted them your entire career. All right, so let's go [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3337.12s)]
*  back to Saki. She says, well, I guess the books will have to tell us what happened. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3343.04s)]
*  Jen, you were right there with the hell you need a book for. You were literally his mouthpiece. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3348.7999999999997s)]
*  You spoke for him. You need a book to tell you what happened? And this super comedian, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3357.04s)]
*  excuse me, I left in 22. I left in 22. Biden was in great shape in 22, was he? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3363.36s)]
*  But then to Sharon's point, why did you get the MSNBC? I'm an insider. I know the scoop from the [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3368.4s)]
*  Biden administration. Biggest insider there is. Now, I don't know what you think. A book will have [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3374.08s)]
*  to tell me. I'll have to read it, like a history book or something. I didn't know a single thing [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3380.48s)]
*  that happened in the Biden administration. So Jen, did you know everything or did you know nothing? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3384.56s)]
*  Which one is it? If you know nothing, why is MSNBC still hiring you? Apparently, you're the worst [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3388.16s)]
*  insider in the world. You literally didn't know anything. So then take back the marketing campaign [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3393.68s)]
*  and your show, etc. God, these guys' lies are unbelievable. And she's like, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3398.96s)]
*  we'll have to figure out what happened in retrospect. In retrospect, you were there day to day. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3405.68s)]
*  You have to wait later to figure out that he couldn't finish sentences. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3414.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, you guys get it. The mainstream media lies almost as much as Donald Trump. That's why no one [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3418.32s)]
*  believes them when they call out Donald Trump. So yeah, I know. And Mitch McConnell wasn't freezing. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3424.56s)]
*  And Dianne Feinstein, mainstream media didn't even call out Dianne Feinstein, man. They're wheeling [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3430.08s)]
*  her around in a wheelchair. She couldn't speak. Nancy Pelosi's daughter was wheeling around going, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3437.2799999999997s)]
*  the Senator Feinstein thinks corporations are awesome and will be voting with them. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3443.92s)]
*  But don't worry, Senator Feinstein is fine. Feinstein was like, what? Right? And they're like, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3447.92s)]
*  shh. By the way, John Fenterman right now has brain damage. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3453.04s)]
*  John Fenterman's pro-Israel. He doesn't have brain damage. What do you mean? There's a giant story [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3459.44s)]
*  about all of his staffers going, my God, he's got brain damage. He walks into traffic, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3465.2000000000003s)]
*  not knowing what's happening. You check your calling them out, right? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3470.7200000000003s)]
*  Get the F out. I mean, God, they're ridiculous. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3477.12s)]
*  Guys, I'm sorry, I'm going crazy today. I can't stand these stories. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3480.64s)]
*  All right, Sharon, we're gonna do the next story. I'm nuts. Let's do the next story. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3485.2s)]
*  Let me just say, remember when Senator Feinstein and she, were you voting yes or no? And they had [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3488.72s)]
*  to say, put your hand down and vote up. It was crazy. It was absolutely crazy. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3493.76s)]
*  It's like Weekend at Bernie's. It's like literal Weekend at Bernie's. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3498.16s)]
*  Literally. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3501.84s)]
*  And mainstream media goes, I don't see it. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3502.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3504.48s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3504.88s)]
*  Do you ever leave the White House? She's talking to the same friends. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3506.64s)]
*  Including Obama. Remember when he was out West and he was doing the fundraiser and Obama had [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3510.08s)]
*  to kind of lead Biden off the stage. It was tragic, but nobody saw it. Nobody saw anything. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3515.04s)]
*  This next one, Jen, just a horrific racist attack. Is this where we are? It used to be, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3540.64s)]
*  you tell your kid, listen, if I'm not around, you need help. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3547.2s)]
*  Just find a mom. Trust a mom. Just not this mom. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3550.24s)]
*  Did you call him a child? Did you call the child a child? It is my own business. Okay, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3555.12s)]
*  why don't you have the boss to say it right now again? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3565.76s)]
*  All right. That's what you say. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3571.1200000000003s)]
*  Nobody dig into your [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3576.32s)]
*  little kid. You call him a little child. Are you about to hit him? You're chasing him here. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3580.1600000000003s)]
*  So that gives you the right to call the child five year old and inward. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3589.0400000000004s)]
*  If that's what he's going to ask. That's what you're going to call him. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3592.5600000000004s)]
*  That's what he's going to act like. You know, that's a hate speech. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3594.72s)]
*  And you can do that. I don't give a. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3598.24s)]
*  Okay, we'll see about that. What the enemy has to say about you. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3602.96s)]
*  Just remember her body language in that clip too. Does she look afraid? That's going to come back. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3607.2s)]
*  Minnesota woman at a local playground. Her older Rachel slurred a five year old black [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3612.8799999999997s)]
*  boy after accusing him of getting too close to her child's diaper bag. When Sharmaek Omar [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3617.3599999999997s)]
*  witnessed the incident stepped in to defend the child who like Omar is of Somali heritage. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3623.92s)]
*  The woman identified as Shiloh Hendrix turned her attention to him. She didn't just use the slur [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3628.64s)]
*  again and again and again. She went further telling Omar and his wife they shouldn't have [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3635.2000000000003s)]
*  more children because they drain the welfare system. So none of this was said in private [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3640.56s)]
*  jank. She was defiant on camera. She stands by her words, her behavior even when confronted. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3647.04s)]
*  And it just made me think has public shaming. He's holding the camera there rolling. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3654.8s)]
*  Has public shaming lost all power? No, it's much worse than that as we're about to show you [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3659.52s)]
*  because she got greatly rewarded for this. So I got a lot of words for the people who contributed [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3666.0s)]
*  to her. So that's coming up in a minute. But so far on the things that we've already covered. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3671.7599999999998s)]
*  The kid that she was calling the N word repeatedly to is five years old. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3677.04s)]
*  If I'm at a park and a five year old goes through my baby's bag, do I think he's stealing something? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3682.96s)]
*  No, I think he's a five year old. I go hey little fella, what are you doing? Where's your parents? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3690.88s)]
*  Right? And I bring him back to his parents. I don't accuse him of being a thief, let alone the N word. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3695.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't go to his parents and tell them that they're taken from the welfare system when I [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3701.6s)]
*  don't know anything about them. And now it might turn out that the kid's also autistic, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3706.4s)]
*  but it doesn't matter. That's not even important. He's a five year old. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3711.84s)]
*  Now, okay, so first of all, let me be super clear. She is definitely racist. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3717.76s)]
*  So let me be very clear about that. So look, these days we're telling people don't blame the [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3724.8s)]
*  voters, right? Republican, Democrat, etc., blame the leaders, etc. And don't go around calling [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3732.0s)]
*  everybody racist and fascist and Nazis. It's not that productive, okay? We wanna win people back. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3738.72s)]
*  But when a person calls a five year old the N word and says, yeah, I bet you guys take [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3743.76s)]
*  welfare money, you black people. Well, what do you want me to call her? You want me to call her not [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3750.0s)]
*  racist? No, she's definitely racist. But wait till you see all the other racist [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3755.44s)]
*  that financially rewarded her. Add a girl, way to take on a five year old black kid and [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3763.92s)]
*  try to ruin his life and call him dirty racial words. Add a girl, they said. Let's find out about [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3770.2400000000002s)]
*  that. Got to teach him young. Rochester police say they've received multiple calls and are [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3776.64s)]
*  investigating the incident. They've apparently concluded that investigation and they've sent [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3782.16s)]
*  things over to the DA's office. We'll see what happens. Meanwhile, the local branch of the NAACP [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3788.24s)]
*  called for the woman to face criminal charges, suggested the slur against the child could [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3793.52s)]
*  constitute rather a hate crime. They made it clear no one should face that kind of abuse, especially [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3798.48s)]
*  not a five year old child at the playground. But we wanna show you this. This is what Cenk [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3804.72s)]
*  was referring to. I mean, this was just a couple hours ago. She might be a millionaire by now. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3810.32s)]
*  The aftermath took a disturbing turn. This is what we're doing. The woman launched a crowdfunding [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3814.7200000000003s)]
*  campaign on Give Send Go, that platform known for hosting right wing fundraisers, quickly pulled [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3820.0s)]
*  in more than a half a million dollars. Currently showing at least last check, 670,000. Comments on [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3826.0s)]
*  the fundraiser were so full of vitriol that the site had to shut them down. Some donors cheered [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3835.2000000000003s)]
*  her on, rewarding her, not despite her racism, but because of it. She now says she plans to use [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3839.76s)]
*  the funds to move someplace safer, less black. Perhaps I added that part. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3845.6800000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Rochester NAACP raised about half of that amount, half to support the child's [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3852.2400000000002s)]
*  family. Here is their poster board on GoFundMe. Ms. Hendricks, meantime, recently posted an update [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3859.2000000000003s)]
*  on her fundraising page. Hello, where do I even begin? The overwhelming support that my family [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3866.9599999999996s)]
*  and myself have received is unbelievable. I've never felt so scared, yet reassured in my life. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3873.9199999999996s)]
*  It's truly a whirlwind of emotions. We're currently doing okay. No one has been harmed, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3880.3999999999996s)]
*  and we are getting by. We are taking the proper procedures in order to stay safe from these [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3886.8799999999997s)]
*  constant threats. I'm still very frightened, and I don't think I will feel safe until [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3892.88s)]
*  we can escape completely. It's ironic, because I could use those same words of someone who looks [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3899.44s)]
*  like me in a circumstance like that. It's not exactly like what Israel's doing, of course. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3906.8s)]
*  But again, I ask, where is the hope, Jane? If this is what we're doing, she's loud, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3915.84s)]
*  she's violent in her words, and disgustingly racist. And yet, my fellow Americans are not just [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3923.12s)]
*  cheering her on or accepting it, right? Accept it, then cheer her on. They're actually, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3931.6800000000003s)]
*  in these difficult times, opening up their wallets and giving to this woman. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3937.04s)]
*  Some people could only afford to give $5, $10. They're doing it, though. That's who they identify [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3941.52s)]
*  with from watching that video. It's so gross. I ask you, what can be done about it? Where's the [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3948.0s)]
*  hope? This is just what we have to deal with. Yeah, so I talk about not blaming the Trump voters, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3955.2s)]
*  because why? Because they voted for one person and against another person, and a lot of them [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3963.52s)]
*  voted against the establishment. And it was a generalized vote. It was voting, again, for one [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3970.48s)]
*  person or against another person. And there was talk of inflation and immigration and so many [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3976.96s)]
*  different issues, right? So somebody might have voted on inflation. Another one might be hardcore [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3982.8s)]
*  mago voter form, because he thinks Trump might be racist, and he loves it, right? So there's a giant [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3987.44s)]
*  range of people. In this case, that doesn't apply, because these people have raised their hand [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3992.56s)]
*  on a specific issue, right? So she sees a five-year-old black kid, and she thinks, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=3999.28s)]
*  I gotta get to safety. All the N-words are all around here, and they're little five-year-olds. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4004.72s)]
*  You probably took money from welfare. You, N-word, this, okay, you're a racist, that's obvious, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4011.4399999999996s)]
*  right? But the people who gave her money, you guys didn't vote on a generalized thing. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4015.68s)]
*  You didn't do this based on inflation or anything else. No, you were like, you called a black kid [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4021.9199999999996s)]
*  the N-word. Congratulations, here's my hard-earned money. I love racism. I love racists like you. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4027.52s)]
*  I love you racist so much that I fund them and try to make them millionaires. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4035.12s)]
*  Everyone who gave to that fund, if they understood the whole situation, is obviously racist. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4041.2000000000003s)]
*  You wanna cry? You wanna cry now? Just because we call little black kids N-word, and then we used [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4046.16s)]
*  to think, great job, Adam Gould. Show that little black kid who he is. He's an N-word. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4052.64s)]
*  Well, I'm not racist. No, you are. You're a baboon, and you're a racist who wants to reward racism. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4059.6s)]
*  You raised your hand for it. I didn't make you raise your hand for it. It wasn't a general election. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4067.2799999999997s)]
*  You said, I love this racist, and I want to finance her. By the way, you know what's gonna [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4071.6s)]
*  happen next, Sharon? Now, all bets are off. Tons of people are gonna go around calling people to [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4075.52s)]
*  N-word and then try to fundraise off of it. They're gonna be like, I called someone an N-word too, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4081.68s)]
*  because somebody give me money. I'm just as racist as she was. You know what? They'll try to one-upper. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4086.48s)]
*  They'll say, yeah, watch how terrible I treated a black person or a Latino or a woman or whatever. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4092.3999999999996s)]
*  Now, give me a million dollars. So- The comments were literally, what you were [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4098.08s)]
*  mockingly, literally the comments said things. They almost verbatim what you were saying there. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4104.32s)]
*  I didn't even see the comments. I'm not surprised, cuz that's who gives money to an avowed racist. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4108.8s)]
*  So now she says, I'm afraid because somebody threatened me online. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4116.64s)]
*  Okay, first of all, nobody should threaten anyone that defeats the whole point. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4123.04s)]
*  Never do violence, never threaten violence, never talk about violence, etc. But look, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4126.8s)]
*  this platform she's raising money is a quote unquote Christian platform. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4133.360000000001s)]
*  No one does more damage to Christianity than so-called Christian leaders, okay? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4136.96s)]
*  This platform also raise money for Kyle Reddenhouse. If you go to a Black Lives Matter [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4141.6s)]
*  protest and you kill a couple of people, we wanna reward you. Let's get you some money, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4145.12s)]
*  some cold hard cash. You call a five-year-old black kid the N-word, let's reward you. Let's [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4149.84s)]
*  see, give you some cold hard cash. By the way, we're Christians. Are you? It doesn't look like it. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4154.24s)]
*  So. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4159.599999999999s)]
*  Can I tell you one other thing, Cenk? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4161.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4162.48s)]
*  She was initially asking for less, but she has just increased the fundraising goal to [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4163.12s)]
*  $1 million. Does she get it while it's hot? Let it keep rolling in. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4168.72s)]
*  No, no, I mean, everyone, the people giving, that's all you're just telling on yourself. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4174.24s)]
*  I'm not gonna do anything about it. I'm not gonna track you down. I'm not gonna be a weirdo, okay? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4179.2s)]
*  But all of you, you gotta live with yourself, right? And you're the person who said, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4183.36s)]
*  I love racism. I like to finance racism. So, okay, that's who you are. Look yourself in the [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4188.88s)]
*  mirror every day, get up and say, man, I love discriminating. Yes, I hate black people. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4194.64s)]
*  It's said, that's who you are. Just own it, okay? Just own it. And don't like now, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4198.96s)]
*  Sharon, I guarantee you, this humans are easy to figure out. Incentives and disincentives. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4203.76s)]
*  This story just provided an enormous financial incentive for all of us to fight each other. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4209.4400000000005s)]
*  And in all directions, okay? If you're racist, bigoted, etc., there's people out there who are [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4215.68s)]
*  gonna give you money for it. So now you're gonna see, if you thought racism and bigotry were bad [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4221.360000000001s)]
*  before, wait till you see it after she raises a million dollars. But you mentioned fighting each [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4226.0s)]
*  other and I know we gotta go. But can we acknowledge that the side who is fighting for, and not [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4231.84s)]
*  everybody, but the side that's fighting in favor and cheering on this racist are much more motivated. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4237.92s)]
*  If we just do the math, I told you the NAACP raised half. Maybe they're just not as good [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4243.44s)]
*  at calling for, I don't know. But it just is ironic to me that this woman raised more than [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4248.5599999999995s)]
*  the autism communities fundraising over the same period too. So these are really motivated [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4255.919999999999s)]
*  racists. They're not just, hey, I say yay, but I'm not gonna get off my couch. These are [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4265.12s)]
*  activist racists. I mean, they gotta stop egging people on, man. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4272.4s)]
*  If you called my kids some kind of word like that, I don't know what would have happened. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4278.08s)]
*  And so this is a runaway freight train. Look, last thing, if you said it about a Jewish person, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4282.32s)]
*  there'd be a congressional hearing, let's be honest, and you would be arrested and maybe deported, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4290.879999999999s)]
*  right? So are we gonna protect black people in the same way? Let's be honest, we're not, right? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4295.5199999999995s)]
*  So imagine if someone says something deeply anti-Semitic, which I would despise. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4302.4s)]
*  In a park like that to a five-year-old Jewish kid, right? Heartbreaking, terrible. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4307.44s)]
*  And then they raise the million dollars. The rest of the country was like, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4313.5199999999995s)]
*  oh boy, way to be an anti-Semite and yell at the five-year-old Jewish kid and call him this word [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4317.599999999999s)]
*  and that word. Oh boy, here's a million bucks. We'd all lose it, right? I mean, that would [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4323.5199999999995s)]
*  definitely be headline news. Why is this on cable news 24-7? Did I miss it? Maybe it's here and [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4328.64s)]
*  there. I hope MSNBC is covering it. But how is this not to, I mean, where's the congressional [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4335.52s)]
*  hearings? Okay, so some people you can do things to and other people you can't. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4340.56s)]
*  This isn't about Israel or anything like that. I don't want anybody getting called any names [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4347.68s)]
*  under any circumstances, okay? But don't tell me that black people have the same power. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4352.88s)]
*  Don't tell me that there isn't racism when somebody just got nearly a million dollars to be racist. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4359.84s)]
*  So you're gonna get a lot more of this going forward and it's gonna be absolutely disgusting. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4366.32s)]
*  And then the people up top are gonna laugh their ass off as we rip each other to shreds. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4371.52s)]
*  And then they'll get another five trillion taxes. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4376.24s)]
*  You said if someone says something anti-Semitic and then deporting. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4379.04s)]
*  If somebody just said, hey, stop the killing of the babies that on U Penn's campus or somewhere [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4383.04s)]
*  else or writes an op-ed and suddenly bam, you're out of here. But this is, we gotta go. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4390.16s)]
*  It just brings up a lot that you were right when you said this first hour is not, this is heavy. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4398.32s)]
*  Yeah, not for the faint of heart. Okay, hey, breaking news, we found out we're not equal. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4406.0s)]
*  Both you and me, Sharon. Definitely not equal. Well, all right, love you. We'll see you soon. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4413.44s)]
*  Guys, everybody stick around. We got Michael Schur coming up and we have more disastrous [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4421.36s)]
*  Trump stories. We also have disastrous anti-Semitic story. So bigotry for everyone. We'll be back. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4427.919999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8ry1dfb6lw&t=4435.44s)]
