**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU)
*  Welcome to the Young Turks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm your host Anna Kasparian. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2.22s)]
*  And for today's show, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=4.04s)]
*  I will not be doing a solo hour. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=5.32s)]
*  Cenk Uygur is running late, but [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=7.18s)]
*  he will be here very soon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=8.92s)]
*  However, I will be covering [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=10.64s)]
*  a really important update to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=12.6s)]
*  possible Medicare cuts by the House [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=14.64s)]
*  GOP in the first segment. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=17.2s)]
*  Later in the show, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=19.72s)]
*  along with Cenk Uygur, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=20.92s)]
*  we'll cover a whole host of other [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  stories in the news today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Including the absolute fear of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=25.8s)]
*  the absolute fury that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=28.36s)]
*  President Donald Trump has been met [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=29.92s)]
*  with in regard to the possibility [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=32.68s)]
*  of him accepting a $400 million [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=35.24s)]
*  plane from the Qatari Royals. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=38.04s)]
*  It seems like there is bipartisan [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=40.96s)]
*  anger in regard to that very notion. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=43.76s)]
*  And it's really interesting because [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  you don't see the same type of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=49.16s)]
*  anger when it comes to other forms [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=51.08s)]
*  of government corruption. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=53.32s)]
*  I mean, I remember the story about [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=55.44s)]
*  the little boy Henry Cuellar up in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=57.56s)]
*  Texas, a Democratic lawmaker, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  of course, allegedly taking bribes [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  from Azerbaijan. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=63.6s)]
*  Whatever happened to that? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=64.88s)]
*  I didn't really hear much about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=66.04s)]
*  that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=67.8s)]
*  There wasn't all this anger and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  fury about a foreign government [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=70.44s)]
*  bribing, allegedly, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=72.56s)]
*  a member of Congress. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, of course, Bob Menendez, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=75.88s)]
*  a Democratic senator, ended up [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=78.16s)]
*  getting prosecuted and convicted [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=80.44s)]
*  for taking illegal bribes from [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  foreign countries. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=85.28s)]
*  And will now serve time in prison [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  as a result of that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=88.92s)]
*  But that story didn't get nearly as [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=89.92s)]
*  much attention as this story [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=92.08s)]
*  involving the Qatari Royals and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=93.84s)]
*  their relationship with Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=95.72s)]
*  So we're going to get to all of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  that later in the show. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  First, though, I do want to talk [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=100.04s)]
*  a little bit about what the latest [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  updates are on the House budget [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=104.04s)]
*  bill, which does, in fact, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=106.04s)]
*  include some cuts to Medicaid. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  Let's get to it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=110.0s)]
*  Protesters representing healthcare [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=117.12s)]
*  workers, people with disabilities, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  and Planned Parenthood stormed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=122.92s)]
*  the Rayburn Building during [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  a congressional hearing on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=127.4s)]
*  potential Medicaid cuts today. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=129.4s)]
*  And as a result, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=131.8s)]
*  Capitol Police are reporting that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=132.8s)]
*  26 people have been arrested for [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=135.08s)]
*  not taking part in the protest, but [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=137.32s)]
*  for disrupting the House hearing on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=139.84s)]
*  the budget bill, and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  the big beautiful budget bill that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump is urging Congress to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=147.0s)]
*  pass, which of course will include [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=149.56s)]
*  nearly $5 trillion in tax cuts. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=152.0s)]
*  And to offset the cost of those tax [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=154.36s)]
*  cuts, we've been hearing over and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  over again that Congress will be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=158.68s)]
*  cutting wasteful spending. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=160.56s)]
*  Well, where do you think [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=162.36s)]
*  they're looking? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  They're looking at Medicaid, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=164.28s)]
*  of course. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Now Medicaid is basically a state [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=166.56s)]
*  run public service, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=168.88s)]
*  it's a public service that's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=170.4s)]
*  a run public healthcare program. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  But it is funded in large part by [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=178.04s)]
*  This was a huge part of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=180.48s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  It expanded Medicaid coverage in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  states by providing additional [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  federal resources in order to do so. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, of course, Medicaid appears to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=191.44s)]
*  be on the chopping block to some [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=193.6s)]
*  extent for House Republicans, but [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  they're trying to do it in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=197.16s)]
*  a very tricky, posicky way. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=198.48s)]
*  Let me explain how. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  What are the proposed cuts? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=201.04s)]
*  Well, if you can recall, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=202.6s)]
*  the House's budget blueprint had [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=204.4s)]
*  directed the House Energy and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=206.8s)]
*  Commerce Committee to find $880 [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=208.92s)]
*  billion in cuts over the next [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=211.4s)]
*  decade. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=213.52s)]
*  Now this also happens to be [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=214.8s)]
*  the committee that's in charge of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=216.28s)]
*  the social programs like Medicaid. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=218.16s)]
*  And so as a result, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=220.8s)]
*  House Republicans have released [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=221.84s)]
*  their plan to cut Medicaid [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=223.72s)]
*  spending, well, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=225.2s)]
*  technically cut Medicaid spending. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=226.4s)]
*  And I'll give you the caveats and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=229.16s)]
*  the details in just a moment. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  But some fiscal hawks in the party [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  are actually complaining that these [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  proposed cuts don't go far enough. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  So what am I referring to? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=239.16s)]
*  What do I mean when I say [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  technically they're cuts? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=242.55999999999997s)]
*  Well, the dollar amount provided to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  states to expand their Medicaid or [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  keep their Medicaid programs will [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  remain the same. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  That's what they're alleging. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=252.88s)]
*  However, it will include work [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=253.88s)]
*  requirements. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=256.36s)]
*  So if you are an individual who [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=257.96s)]
*  does not make enough money, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=260.44s)]
*  does not have enough income in [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=262.12s)]
*  order to pay for your own private [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=264.08s)]
*  health insurance, or if you don't [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=266.32s)]
*  have a job that provides health [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=268.56s)]
*  insurance maybe because you're [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  working part time. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, in order to qualify for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=273.84s)]
*  Medicaid, the federal government, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=275.52s)]
*  Republicans in the federal [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=277.64s)]
*  government specifically want to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=279.2s)]
*  ensure that able bodied [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=281.08s)]
*  individuals are working in order [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=282.56s)]
*  to qualify. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=284.52s)]
*  This will also include more [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=285.24s)]
*  frequent eligibility checks in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=287.08s)]
*  order to ensure that people [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=289.36s)]
*  receiving these benefits are [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=291.4s)]
*  eligible to do so. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=293.88s)]
*  And I should note it doesn't lower [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=295.48s)]
*  the minimum share the federal [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=297.88s)]
*  government contributes to Medicaid [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=299.96s)]
*  in each state or the cap per person [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=302.52s)]
*  spending in the program. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=304.96s)]
*  So this is the tricky, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  posicky way they are cutting [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=308.36s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=310.0s)]
*  What they're essentially doing is [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=311.0s)]
*  saying like no, no, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=312.8s)]
*  the dollar amount is going to be [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=313.68s)]
*  the same. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  It's just that we're going to make [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=315.68s)]
*  it harder for people to be [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=317.48s)]
*  eligible for Medicaid. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=319.04s)]
*  So people will be kicked off [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=320.4s)]
*  the rolls. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=321.8s)]
*  And as a result of that, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=322.44s)]
*  the federal government will be [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=323.76s)]
*  saving some resources. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=325.6s)]
*  I just find it interesting that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=327.24s)]
*  whenever it comes to cutting [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=329.52s)]
*  spending, the first thing on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=331.52s)]
*  the chopping block tends to be [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=333.52s)]
*  programs that help the most [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=335.32s)]
*  vulnerable people in this country. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=337.0s)]
*  Fellow Americans who desperately [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=339.36s)]
*  need healthcare coverage, but [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=341.52s)]
*  don't have the means or the money [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=343.6s)]
*  to be able to afford it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  So as far as the work [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=347.4s)]
*  requirements go, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=348.64s)]
*  let's get granular. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  Let's see what they're proposing [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=351.12s)]
*  here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  The bill would require Medicaid [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=353.56s)]
*  recipients to work, volunteer or [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=355.56s)]
*  attend school for 80 hours per [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=357.82s)]
*  month. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so the requirement would [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=361.64s)]
*  apply to most able bodied adults [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  through age 64 without dependents [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  and includes exceptions for [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=368.02s)]
*  pregnant women, people with [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  substance use disorders and others. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=371.84s)]
*  Now, I need a little more clarity [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=374.56s)]
*  on this because what happens if [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=376.36s)]
*  you are searching for work but [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=378.32s)]
*  are unable to find work? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  Something that might become more [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=382.6s)]
*  of a problem if Donald Trump does [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=384.6s)]
*  intend to move forward with some of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=386.48s)]
*  the more astronomical tariffs that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=388.56s)]
*  he is implementing on our trade [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=390.72s)]
*  partners, right? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=392.64s)]
*  So if it's more costly to get [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=394.24s)]
*  the parts you need for your [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=396.04s)]
*  business, if it's more expensive to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=397.76s)]
*  get the products you need to sell [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=400.0s)]
*  in your business, you're likely [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=401.92s)]
*  going to shut your business down. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  It's going to file for bankruptcy [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=405.6s)]
*  or you're going to lay off workers. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=407.48s)]
*  So that's just something to keep [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  in mind, all of these different [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  proposed policies don't just stand [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=412.92s)]
*  alone in a vacuum. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=414.90000000000003s)]
*  You have to look at the bigger [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=416.48s)]
*  picture, the current economic [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  conditions and what House [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  Republicans are proposing here. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  So when Arkansas, by the way, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=423.24s)]
*  briefly implemented work [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  requirements for Medicaid [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=427.12s)]
*  recipients, one in four [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=429.0s)]
*  participants in that state, which [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=430.72s)]
*  amounted to about 18,000 people, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=433.16s)]
*  had health care coverage and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=435.4s)]
*  that was the point, okay? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=437.47999999999996s)]
*  So that is what the House [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  Republicans are trying to do here, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=441.23999999999995s)]
*  just make it more difficult for [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=443.47999999999996s)]
*  people to be eligible for [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=445.44s)]
*  Medicaid benefits. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=446.96s)]
*  So there's this assumption that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=448.32s)]
*  Americans who need help from [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=450.84s)]
*  the social safety net are just [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=453.12s)]
*  these lazy people who are unwilling [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=455.56s)]
*  to earn an income and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=458.32s)]
*  take care of themselves. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=459.84s)]
*  But I actually want to go to this [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=461.76s)]
*  analysis that was done by the Kaiser [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=463.6s)]
*  Family Foundation. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=465.68s)]
*  Now KFF is not in any way associated [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=466.72s)]
*  with Kaiser, meaning the healthcare [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=469.08s)]
*  system, the hospital, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=471.64s)]
*  this is entirely separate. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=473.2s)]
*  But they did an analysis to see [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=474.6s)]
*  what percentage of Americans are [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=477.12s)]
*  actually working while receiving [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=479.76s)]
*  these benefits. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=482.36s)]
*  And by the way, they're eligible [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=484.16s)]
*  for the benefits, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=485.92s)]
*  meaning they're working but [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=487.0s)]
*  they're still not generating [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=488.52s)]
*  enough income to be able to afford [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=490.24s)]
*  health insurance on their own, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=492.04s)]
*  which is why they're [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=493.6s)]
*  eligible for Medicaid. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=494.6s)]
*  Well, let's take a look at this [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=495.76s)]
*  breakdown, this fun pie chart. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=497.4s)]
*  So if you look at this, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=499.72s)]
*  it'll show you that 64% of Medicaid [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=501.08s)]
*  recipients are working. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=503.2s)]
*  And by the way, this data is from [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=504.8s)]
*  2023, as you can see, work status [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=506.8s)]
*  and barriers to work among Medicaid [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=508.96s)]
*  adults, 2023. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=511.2s)]
*  So it focuses specifically on [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=512.68s)]
*  adults, so that's 26.1 million [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=515.12s)]
*  people, and 64% of them are [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=518.0s)]
*  actually working, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=520.76s)]
*  they are employed. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=521.96s)]
*  44% of them are working at least [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=523.0s)]
*  35 hours a week, which this [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=525.96s)]
*  analysis has considered full time [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  work. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=532.0s)]
*  20% of the individuals are actually [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=533.28s)]
*  working part time. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=535.72s)]
*  The rest are not working though, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=537.44s)]
*  due to illness or disability, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=539.64s)]
*  school attendance, or because [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=541.72s)]
*  they're a caregiver to a loved one. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=543.76s)]
*  Okay, I'm now learning firsthand [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=546.6s)]
*  how labor intensive it is to take [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=549.24s)]
*  care of a loved one who has fallen [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=551.6400000000001s)]
*  ill. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=554.24s)]
*  It's a difficult job to do, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  it's hard to balance a full time [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=556.76s)]
*  job while doing that simultaneously. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=558.48s)]
*  So I would like to live in a [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=561.2s)]
*  country that actually supports our [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=562.76s)]
*  fellow Americans as they're going [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=564.84s)]
*  through what could be the hardest [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=566.84s)]
*  period of their lives, taking care [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=568.76s)]
*  of a loved one who has fallen ill [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  or is trying to recover from [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=573.0s)]
*  a serious injury. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=574.9200000000001s)]
*  So the data on whether this will [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=576.28s)]

*  So a 2023 analysis from the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=587.76s)]
*  nonpartisan community has [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=589.96s)]
*  shown that the data on whether this [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=592.08s)]
*  was saved money by the way is [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=594.92s)]
*  mixed and I think it's really [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=597.44s)]
*  important to know that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=600.2s)]
*  So a 2023 analysis from [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=603.12s)]
*  the nonpartisan community has [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=604.4s)]
*  shown Congressional Budget Office [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=606.08s)]
*  found that imposing work rules on [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=608.2s)]
*  Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=610.2s)]
*  who are not parents or caregivers [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=612.32s)]
*  would cut federal spending by [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=614.36s)]
*  an estimated $109 billion over [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=616.2s)]
*  the next 10 years. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=618.2800000000001s)]
*  Wow, that sounds like a lot of [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=619.6s)]
*  money until you remember that the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=621.2s)]
*  tax cuts that Trump implemented in [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=623.12s)]
*  2017 cost our federal government [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=625.12s)]
*  a whopping $10 trillion. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=627.24s)]
*  $10 trillion, that's insane. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=629.0s)]
*  Okay, and he wants to implement [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=633.08s)]
*  additional tax cuts which will [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=634.8000000000001s)]
*  amount to close to $5 trillion. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=636.6800000000001s)]
*  And so you look at this $109 [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=638.72s)]
*  billion over the next 10 years [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=640.96s)]
*  that would be saved allegedly [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=643.12s)]
*  through Medicaid cuts, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=645.24s)]
*  drop in the bucket. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=646.96s)]
*  But that's the analysis that looks [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=648.84s)]
*  pretty good for the case that [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=651.32s)]
*  Republicans are making. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=653.32s)]
*  But as I mentioned, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=655.36s)]
*  the data is mixed. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=656.76s)]
*  So also in 2018, the CBO estimated [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=658.32s)]
*  that states would incur $65 billion [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=661.48s)]
*  in administrative costs over 10 [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=664.68s)]
*  years to implement and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=667.3199999999999s)]
*  manage work requirements. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=668.9599999999999s)]
*  Because remember, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=671.16s)]
*  if you're going to impose work [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=672.7199999999999s)]
*  requirements on Americans who want [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=675.0799999999999s)]
*  to qualify for Medicaid, well, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=677.88s)]
*  you gotta add to the bureaucracy, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=680.4s)]
*  bro. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=683.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, who's going to check to make [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=685.0799999999999s)]
*  sure these people are working? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=686.4s)]
*  You're going to have to hire [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=688.0s)]
*  people. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=689.12s)]
*  That onus, by the way, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=689.64s)]
*  will be placed on the states. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=690.8s)]
*  So the federal government is going [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=692.64s)]
*  to force the states to incur [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=694.36s)]
*  additional costs in order to carry [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=696.24s)]
*  out this work requirement policy [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=698.88s)]
*  for Medicaid, which is just being [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=701.44s)]
*  used as a ridiculous facade in [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=703.96s)]
*  saving money to justify additional [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=706.08s)]
*  tax cuts. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=708.7600000000001s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=709.4000000000001s)]
*  So here are the other ways the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=711.12s)]
*  Republicans in the House plan to [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=713.2s)]
*  save money by cutting eligibility [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=715.44s)]
*  to Medicaid. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=718.0s)]
*  So the legislation seeks to ensure [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=719.7600000000001s)]
*  only those who are eligible remain [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=721.8000000000001s)]
*  in Medicaid roles, delaying [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=723.88s)]
*  Biden-era rules on looser [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=725.88s)]
*  eligibility checks and blocking [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=727.64s)]
*  federal funds for [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=729.76s)]
*  Medicaid recipients whose [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=730.92s)]
*  citizenship or immigration status [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=732.6s)]
*  is unverified. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=734.8s)]
*  So the bill would also reduce [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=735.96s)]
*  federal Medicaid payments to [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=737.76s)]
*  states that provide healthcare [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=739.68s)]
*  coverage for immigrants in [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=741.84s)]
*  the country illegally. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=743.72s)]
*  So look, this is going to be [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=745.48s)]
*  a huge problem for states like [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=747.16s)]
*  California and New York, which have [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=749.2s)]
*  publicly provided Medicaid coverage [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=751.8399999999999s)]
*  to individuals in the country [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=754.3599999999999s)]
*  illegally. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=756.3599999999999s)]
*  And so I want to give you an [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=757.3599999999999s)]
*  example of California, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=759.12s)]
*  because California actually is in [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=760.88s)]
*  a little bit of trouble financially [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  as we speak. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=765.5999999999999s)]
*  We've lost a huge portion of our [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=766.4799999999999s)]
*  tax base which has left the state [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=768.64s)]
*  to find more affordable places to [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=770.8399999999999s)]
*  live obviously at the same time. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=773.16s)]
*  Because of all these nonprofit [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=776.3599999999999s)]
*  griffs that have popped up since [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=778.68s)]
*  2020, we have lost tens of [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=781.12s)]
*  billions of dollars in funding [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=782.9599999999999s)]
*  that was allocated specifically to [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=785.16s)]
*  build housing and help the homeless. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=787.7199999999999s)]
*  That money is still unaccounted for [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=790.16s)]
*  it is unbelievable that there hasn't [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=792.48s)]
*  been any justice with that massive [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=795.0799999999999s)]
*  loss of taxpayer resources. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=797.56s)]
*  And so there have been budget [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=799.88s)]
*  shortfalls in recent years. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=801.7199999999999s)]
*  LA specifically is dealing with [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=803.8399999999999s)]
*  a massive $1 billion budget [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=805.8399999999999s)]
*  shortfall. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=807.64s)]
*  And so there have been some [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=808.68s)]
*  close cuts to all sorts of services [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=810.22s)]
*  in the state of California. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=812.38s)]
*  At the same time, look, it is true, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=814.78s)]
*  providing healthcare to all, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=817.58s)]
*  including those who might not be [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=819.98s)]
*  documented, is a costly endeavor. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=822.3000000000001s)]
*  And so in 2023, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=825.0600000000001s)]
*  California expanded MediCal, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=826.62s)]
*  which is the state's Medicaid [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=829.5s)]
*  program, to include all undocumented [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=831.9s)]
*  immigrants regardless of age. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=834.82s)]
*  Now, the Newsom administration [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=836.94s)]
*  under estimated how much this would [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=840.54s)]
*  cost, he initially projected the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=842.86s)]
*  cost would be $6.4 billion. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=845.1999999999999s)]
*  However, in March, he requested [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=847.98s)]
*  state lawmakers approve an [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=850.22s)]
*  additional $2.8 billion loan to [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=852.22s)]
*  help cover for [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=854.62s)]
*  the state's soaring Medicaid costs. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=855.6s)]
*  So that's just a little bit of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=858.6999999999999s)]
*  a tangent out of everything that's [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=860.9399999999999s)]
*  being proposed in regard to saving [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=863.98s)]
*  money or doing cuts or [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=866.62s)]
*  making it more difficult to [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=868.7s)]
*  qualify for Medicaid. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=870.98s)]
*  I would say this is the one area [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=873.5s)]
*  where Republicans have a little bit [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=875.22s)]
*  of a point. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=877.06s)]
*  However, I also know that [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=878.38s)]
*  Republicans are very heavy handed [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=880.14s)]
*  in wanting to make it very [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=882.3s)]
*  difficult for people to qualify or [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=883.8s)]
*  be eligible for Medicaid. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=885.86s)]
*  So I would rather them not touch [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=888.26s)]
*  Medicaid at all, but let me continue [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=890.1s)]
*  with the other things they want to [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=892.14s)]
*  do. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=893.94s)]
*  So the proposal would also require [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=894.44s)]

*  because he understands how [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1206.58s)]
*  politically unpopular it would be [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1207.9399999999998s)]
*  to do so. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1209.6599999999999s)]

*  I'm waiting to hear what he has to [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1212.5s)]
*  say, because if you think cutting [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1214.3s)]
*  Medicaid eligibility is the right [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1216.3799999999999s)]

*  you've got another thing coming. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1226.74s)]
*  There will be consequences, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1229.02s)]
*  there will be blood. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1230.78s)]
*  Just not in the form of a nurse [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1232.54s)]

*  preventative care. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1240.86s)]

*  bring you a Dusty Johnson, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1309.3s)]

*  Okay. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1312.74s)]
*  All right, that's what happened [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1313.94s)]
*  today, apparently. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1315.14s)]
*  All right, also later today, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1315.98s)]
*  the story I'm most animated about. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1317.94s)]
*  Look, I know we've been over [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1320.38s)]
*  100 times, but mainstream media [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1321.7800000000002s)]
*  just figured out Biden's too old. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1323.38s)]
*  And so we're going to talk about [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1326.18s)]
*  that, and we're going to talk about [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1327.38s)]
*  other older Democrats. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1328.66s)]
*  And speaking of tyt.com, our poll [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1329.5800000000002s)]
*  there, our daily poll there is, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1331.5s)]
*  should we respect senior [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1333.1000000000001s)]
*  Democratic leaders like [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1334.1000000000001s)]
*  James Clyburn? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1335.3000000000002s)]
*  I have strong opinions on that, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1336.6200000000001s)]
*  okay? But a lot of people think, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1337.94s)]
*  of course, you do respect. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1339.3000000000002s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1340.8200000000002s)]
*  All right, Casper, what's next? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1341.42s)]
*  There is chaos in the DOJ. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1343.66s)]
*  Let's get to it. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1346.1000000000001s)]
*  Honestly, every single day, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1348.14s)]
*  Pam Blondie is on Fox News. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1349.9s)]
*  She's on Fox News more than she [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1351.66s)]
*  does her job, and other people are [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1353.1000000000001s)]
*  starting to realize it. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1354.7s)]
*  And that might be by design, but [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1357.5s)]
*  Pam Blondie is not happy about it. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1359.82s)]
*  So it turns out that, well, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1362.26s)]
*  last week, Laura Loomer, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1364.3400000000001s)]
*  as you just heard, fumed at [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1366.18s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Blondie for [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1367.9s)]
*  spending all of her time doing [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1370.1000000000001s)]
*  these Fox News appearances. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1371.9s)]
*  But according to a new report by [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1373.9s)]
*  the New York Times, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1376.46s)]
*  Blondie really does see her media [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1378.2s)]
*  touring as part of her job. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1380.8200000000002s)]
*  The problem is it's kind of become [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1383.3400000000001s)]
*  her only job, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1385.5800000000002s)]
*  according to this report. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1386.5400000000002s)]
*  So the same report explains that [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1387.94s)]
*  Pam Blondie is more of a mouthpiece [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1390.94s)]
*  or, I guess, the outward-facing [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1394.02s)]
*  representative of the DOJ, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1397.02s)]
*  as opposed to the person calling [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1399.34s)]
*  the shots. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1401.7s)]
*  That's really the thesis of this [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1402.46s)]
*  whole piece. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1404.6599999999999s)]
*  And that really does raise [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1406.06s)]
*  an important question, Cenk. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1407.54s)]
*  If it's not Pam Blondie serving as [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1409.3799999999999s)]
*  the attorney general in [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1411.6599999999999s)]
*  the Department of Justice, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1413.34s)]
*  who is calling the shots? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1415.34s)]
*  Yeah, well, we have some answers [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1417.7s)]
*  to that, as this story's [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1419.18s)]
*  going to reveal. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1420.22s)]
*  But I'm torn on this story. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1420.98s)]
*  So I'm not torn in terms of [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1423.5s)]
*  the policy or substance. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1424.86s)]
*  No, it's a disaster, that DOJ. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1426.62s)]
*  It's as bad as you could have [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1428.3799999999999s)]
*  imagined. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1430.1399999999999s)]
*  But is it true that a lot of the [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1430.6999999999998s)]
*  job is optics and [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1432.8999999999999s)]
*  that the Democrats didn't [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1434.1399999999999s)]
*  understand that? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1436.1399999999999s)]
*  Yes, that part is true, okay? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1438.82s)]
*  That comes at the very end. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1440.9399999999998s)]
*  But first, let's find out who's [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1441.9399999999998s)]
*  actually in charge of the Justice [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1443.22s)]
*  Department and [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1444.54s)]
*  making the decisions. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1445.06s)]
*  You'll see it's a person who's not [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1446.54s)]
*  even a lawyer. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1447.74s)]
*  Well, we'll get to that shortly, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1449.02s)]
*  actually. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1450.02s)]
*  But before we get to who the person [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1450.52s)]
*  calling the shots happens to be, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1452.4199999999998s)]
*  the piece titled as White House [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1454.1799999999998s)]

*  And I think it will be [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1543.74s)]

*  I put it in here to show you [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1559.78s)]
*  earlier, you can barely see it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1561.18s)]
*  It looks like one grain, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1563.22s)]
*  this is salt not fentanyl, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1564.66s)]
*  one grain is all it takes to kill [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1566.3s)]

*  ladies and gentlemen. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1572.82s)]
*  Now, again, the big question is if [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1574.46s)]
*  she's just doing media appearances [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1576.46s)]
*  and that's really the only role [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1578.54s)]
*  that she has within the Department [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1580.3s)]

*  It turns out it's Stephen Miller. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1584.46s)]
*  Yeah, well, well, well. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1587.4199999999998s)]
*  All right, so first of all, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1589.02s)]
*  we got a poll in the live chat. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1590.3799999999999s)]
*  What's worse, having Pam Bond in [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1592.02s)]
*  charge or Stephen Miller in charge? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1593.7s)]
*  I have thoughts on that as well. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1595.58s)]
*  And so already Miller is worse. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1597.7s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1601.78s)]
*  Watch the show live 6 to 8 PM. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1603.42s)]
*  He's certainly going to be part of [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1605.1399999999999s)]
*  the show here. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1605.94s)]
*  All right, so first of all, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1606.82s)]
*  those appearances, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1608.34s)]
*  two thoughts on it. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1609.74s)]
*  Number one, it's embarrassing. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1611.34s)]
*  Like when you go out there and [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1614.54s)]
*  you are so over the top like she [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1616.06s)]
*  is, he won with a great majority. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1617.54s)]
*  He won by two points, okay, which [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1620.94s)]
*  for Republicans is like a minor [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1622.62s)]
*  miracle because they almost never [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1624.02s)]
*  won the popular vote in [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1625.58s)]
*  the national election. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1626.6599999999999s)]
*  But don't pretend that it was like [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1627.82s)]
*  60% and everybody's falling at [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1629.3s)]
*  his feet, especially when his [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1630.74s)]
*  polling is at 39%, 40% in that [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1632.1799999999998s)]
*  ballpark right now. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1633.82s)]
*  So it's on the other hand, this is [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1636.1s)]
*  the problem with the Republican [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1637.78s)]
*  Democratic Party, they have [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1639.1s)]
*  completely divergent problems, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1640.5s)]
*  okay, but at the same time, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1642.26s)]
*  serving the same purpose. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1643.74s)]
*  So Merrick Garland didn't know what [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1646.26s)]
*  a television camera was, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1648.3s)]
*  never saw one, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1649.86s)]
*  didn't understand what a microphone [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1650.6599999999999s)]
*  was, couldn't make his case if his [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1652.54s)]
*  life depended on it and slept in [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1654.34s)]
*  a, he was Rip Van Binkle if you [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1656.1799999999998s)]
*  remember that old story. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1657.9399999999998s)]
*  Like just sitting in a, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1659.5s)]
*  sleeping in a cave somewhere. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1660.6999999999998s)]
*  That's terrible, that's terrible. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1662.54s)]
*  You gotta go and be aggressive and [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1664.1799999999998s)]
*  make your case, etc. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1665.82s)]
*  She on the other hand, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1667.26s)]
*  all she does is TV and [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1668.4199999999998s)]
*  she just comes on and she's like, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1669.4599999999998s)]
*  my God, I don't know if you know, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1671.1799999999998s)]
*  but Donald Trump is a great person [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1672.9399999999998s)]
*  to have a look. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1674.6999999999998s)]
*  You're like, Jesus Christ, man. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1675.62s)]
*  I just look, I get that the heads [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1677.4599999999998s)]
*  of federal government agencies, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1679.82s)]
*  bureaucrats and even elected law [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1683.14s)]
*  man, especially elected lawmakers [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1685.22s)]
*  lie, that's what they do, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1687.46s)]
*  they're liars, right? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1689.0600000000002s)]
*  And so I'm not shocked that she [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1690.46s)]
*  went on Fox News and lied about [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1692.6200000000001s)]
*  the Epstein files. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1694.7800000000002s)]
*  But it was just such a brazen [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1696.46s)]
*  specific lie. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1698.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1700.5s)]

*  tomorrow Jesse Waters, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1702.14s)]
*  you're going to see the Epstein [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1703.46s)]
*  files. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1705.1000000000001s)]
*  Did we see the Epstein files [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1705.6200000000001s)]
*  though? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1706.8200000000002s)]

*  I think that's one of the really [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1708.8600000000001s)]
*  interesting parts of the story and [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1710.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm very curious to see if it's [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1712.02s)]
*  going to then land on Stephen [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1713.62s)]
*  Miller's shoulders, okay? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1714.86s)]
*  Because in the old days, if you [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1716.3s)]

*  Joe Biden's the youngest person [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1725.7s)]
*  who's ever lived, right? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1727.54s)]
*  And then with Trump team for [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1729.18s)]
*  the MAGA crew, if you said Donald [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1730.78s)]
*  Trump is eight feet tall and [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1732.82s)]
*  shoots lightning bolts out of his [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1734.46s)]
*  arse, right? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1736.42s)]
*  They would be like, of course he [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1737.26s)]
*  does, of course he does, right? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1739.06s)]
*  And so you could tell any lie you [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1741.06s)]
*  want, if you were a Democrat or [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1742.74s)]
*  a Republican, and you would have [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1744.26s)]
*  a squadron of people in media [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1745.9s)]
*  going, it's absolutely true, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1747.22s)]
*  he's eight foot tall, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1748.82s)]
*  he's young and dynamic. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1749.98s)]
*  So now, Pam Bond is getting caught [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1751.9s)]
*  with new media at the helm, and [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1754.06s)]
*  the situation's a little bit [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1755.94s)]
*  different. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1757.78s)]
*  And so what did we tell you guys [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1758.98s)]
*  here on The Young Turks? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1760.42s)]
*  I said, look, I've been all over [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1761.42s)]
*  these shows, and they're going to [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1762.94s)]
*  splinter because they don't agree. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1764.5s)]
*  So why did Pam Bondi get caught? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1766.42s)]
*  Did she get caught by [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1769.26s)]
*  the New York Times? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1770.3s)]
*  This is a really good story, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1771.54s)]
*  it has really interesting details [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1772.58s)]
*  we didn't know, like Stephen [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1773.98s)]
*  Miller's in charge, etc. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1775.1s)]
*  We'll get to more of those in [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1776.26s)]
*  a second. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1777.3799999999999s)]
*  But no, she got caught by [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1778.26s)]
*  the right wing guys. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1779.66s)]
*  And why? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1781.58s)]
*  Because she was kissing Trumps, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1782.46s)]
*  no, they don't mind that at all, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1783.54s)]
*  right? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1784.66s)]
*  No, because she said the absentee [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1785.42s)]
*  files would be there, and [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1786.74s)]
*  they weren't there. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1787.74s)]
*  And when they caught her, and [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1789.02s)]
*  they're super mad about it, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1790.42s)]
*  she's like, I don't get it. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1791.78s)]
*  I lied 24 seven, I took $25,000 [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1793.66s)]
*  from Donald Trump and [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1796.06s)]
*  dropped a case against them, and [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1797.58s)]
*  no one minded. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1799.9s)]
*  I mean, I made $3 million with [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1801.3400000000001s)]
*  another deal I made with Trump, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1802.98s)]
*  no one minded. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1804.7800000000002s)]
*  Why are you guys minding all of [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1805.5s)]
*  a sudden when I'm lying? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1807.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm supposed to lie, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1809.1000000000001s)]
*  I think that's her reaction. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1810.22s)]
*  Yeah, and look, honestly, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1811.8200000000002s)]
*  the release of the Epstein files [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1814.26s)]
*  is a priority for [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1816.8600000000001s)]
*  Trump supporters, for MAGA. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1818.6200000000001s)]
*  That is something that they wanted, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1821.5s)]
*  that is something that Trump [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1822.7800000000002s)]
*  promised to do for them. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1823.8600000000001s)]
*  And so it is a, I mean, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1825.1000000000001s)]
*  it took balls to engage in that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1828.3s)]
*  very specific lie, right? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1830.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but she didn't know, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1833.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you, she didn't know [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1833.94s)]
*  that she was going to get caught [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1835.06s)]
*  by her own side. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1835.94s)]
*  In fact, nobody knew that, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1837.06s)]
*  other than us, I'm being honest, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1838.3s)]
*  right? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1839.9s)]
*  You could have gave me four, but [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1840.42s)]
*  it's true. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1841.94s)]
*  If you ask the Democrats, is MAGA [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1842.46s)]
*  going to catch Trump's [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1844.9s)]
*  ass kissing Attorney General? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1846.42s)]
*  Every Democrat would have said, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1849.1000000000001s)]
*  no way, MAGA will never turn on [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1850.78s)]
*  the Attorney General, as long as [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1852.42s)]
*  she's got Trump on his corner, and [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1854.22s)]
*  no Republican would have believed [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1856.14s)]
*  that, etc. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1858.02s)]
*  But you can say, all right, now, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1858.74s)]
*  what I'm curious about is, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1860.54s)]
*  is Stephen Miller, then, is he [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1861.86s)]
*  involved in not releasing [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1863.54s)]
*  the Epstein files? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1864.94s)]
*  Maybe, I don't know. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1866.1s)]
*  And that's a really important [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1867.1s)]
*  question, is Stephen Miller [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1868.7s)]
*  going to get caught? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1870.26s)]
*  Or are they going to give him [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1871.5s)]
*  a free pass? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1872.5s)]
*  We'll see, we'll see. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1873.1s)]
*  But I do want to remind everyone [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1893.74s)]
*  of who Stephen Miller is. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1895.82s)]
*  So let's go to the very last video [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1898.06s)]
*  here. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1899.3799999999999s)]

*  the House of Justice. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1902.42s)]
*  Let me also just say, since we're [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1904.18s)]
*  addressing the subject of style, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1906.14s)]
*  the most stylish President and [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1908.3000000000002s)]
*  First Lady in our lifetimes are [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1910.3400000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump and Melania Trump. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1912.46s)]
*  Donald Trump's a style icon. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1915.5s)]
*  He changed American fashion [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1917.66s)]
*  in The Apprentice. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1919.18s)]
*  People spent the next 10 years [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1920.26s)]
*  trying to dress like Donald Trump. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1921.66s)]
*  So if anybody deserves a puff piece [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1923.26s)]
*  on their sense of style, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1925.38s)]
*  it's Donald Trump and [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1926.8600000000001s)]
*  the First Lady. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1928.14s)]
*  Joe Biden, to the point that [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1929.66s)]
*  Mike Huckabee made so well, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1931.46s)]
*  looks like a walking corpse. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1933.22s)]
*  The only style article that should [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1935.8200000000002s)]
*  be written about Joe Biden is how [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1937.7s)]
*  you've mastered the art of [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1939.46s)]
*  looking embalmed. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1940.94s)]
*  The scales of justice look great. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1944.7s)]
*  So he is not a lawyer, but he, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1947.66s)]
*  it was clear from the start that [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1950.38s)]
*  Miller, who is not a lawyer, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1953.1000000000001s)]
*  would exercise control inside [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1955.3400000000001s)]
*  the department, current and [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1957.46s)]

*  So look, there are two more power [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1961.14s)]
*  players in the Trump [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1963.42s)]
*  administration, or I should say in [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1964.72s)]
*  Trump's Department of Justice. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1967.0600000000002s)]

*  subordinates. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1977.42s)]
*  Now, according to the Times, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1979.14s)]

*  operations of the department. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1982.26s)]
*  And Bondi was deeply displeased by [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1984.0600000000002s)]
*  the arrangement and told friends it [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1986.26s)]

*  own organization. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1990.24s)]
*  It made no difference. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1991.88s)]
*  She has tried to adapt and [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1993.4s)]
*  has become close to Boeve, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1995.3s)]
*  a stoic enforcer who she refers to [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1997.26s)]
*  as sweet Emile, according to [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=1999.76s)]
*  several officials. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2002.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, one example of Bondi's limited [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2005.08s)]
*  power has to do with the January 6 [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2007.08s)]
*  pardons, which is a really [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2009.04s)]
*  interesting revelation from [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2010.56s)]
*  the story. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2012.2s)]
*  So she apparently only wanted [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2012.76s)]
*  pardons to be issued to the non [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2014.84s)]
*  violent individuals who had either [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2016.76s)]
*  been convicted or charged. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2019.22s)]
*  The Time reports that Bondi was [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2021.1000000000001s)]
*  blindsided by Trump's decision to [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2023.0600000000002s)]
*  just pardon everybody, blanket [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2025.22s)]
*  pardon, including the violent [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2027.3000000000002s)]
*  rioters, including the individuals [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2029.18s)]
*  who assaulted police officers. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2031.5600000000002s)]
*  It's all caught on camera. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2033.5800000000002s)]
*  So here's how the Trump [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2034.94s)]
*  administration responded to [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2036.3000000000002s)]
*  the Times' report. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2038.26s)]
*  Chad Mazzel, the attorney general's [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2039.5800000000002s)]
*  chief of staff said close [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2042.3400000000001s)]
*  coordination with the West Wing was [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2044.22s)]
*  essential to fight a liberal [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2046.82s)]
*  department workforce. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2048.86s)]
*  President Biden, he argued, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2051.82s)]
*  did not need to exert such control [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2053.62s)]
*  because most career staff members [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2055.7s)]
*  were already willing to blindly [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2057.7s)]
*  implement his agenda. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2059.62s)]
*  Cenk. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2062.74s)]
*  Yeah, so this story is filled with [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2063.38s)]
*  unbearable details of how these [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2065.74s)]
*  guys operate. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2068.12s)]
*  And I know, so this portion, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2069.2599999999998s)]
*  most of them I don't know if they'll [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2071.06s)]
*  ever know, right? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2073.22s)]
*  But it's important for [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2074.46s)]
*  all of us to know and it's most [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2075.84s)]
*  important for independents to know. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2077.6000000000004s)]
*  So the part of the story that [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2079.96s)]
*  bothered me the most is Pam Bondi [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2081.7000000000003s)]
*  goes into a meeting with one of her [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2083.96s)]
*  top lawyers. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2086.32s)]
*  And in that room, they haven't yet [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2088.52s)]
*  changed Biden and [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2090.6400000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris' and [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2091.7200000000003s)]
*  Merrick Garland's pictures, right? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2092.96s)]
*  They've only been there a couple of [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2095.4s)]
*  months, it's an oversight. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2096.6800000000003s)]
*  Nobody's trying to do anything [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2097.6000000000004s)]
*  with it, right? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2099.0800000000004s)]
*  So she sees it, she goes, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2100.1600000000003s)]
*  you should change those pictures. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2101.8s)]
*  So far, no problem. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2103.52s)]
*  Okay, they should change the [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2104.6s)]
*  pictures. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2106.64s)]
*  She walks out of the room, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2108.0s)]
*  fires the guy. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2109.12s)]
*  Like immediately? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2110.96s)]
*  Immediately, fires him. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2112.24s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2113.6s)]
*  I'm not sanctioning it. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2115.16s)]
*  I don't think it's a good thing. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2117.36s)]
*  It's just unbelievably ridiculous [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2118.24s)]
*  and egotistical to do that. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2121.08s)]
*  Like who cares? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2122.36s)]
*  So because to them, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2123.4s)]
*  the law is totally irrelevant. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2125.2s)]
*  Serving the average American voter [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2128.4s)]
*  is totally irrelevant. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2130.36s)]
*  The only thing that matters is how [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2131.96s)]
*  hard you kiss Trump's ass. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2134.16s)]
*  And this is really, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2136.8399999999997s)]
*  as an American citizen, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2137.92s)]
*  it's unbearable. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2139.2799999999997s)]
*  The Department of Justice is [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2140.8799999999997s)]
*  supposed to be independent of [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2141.96s)]
*  the White House. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2142.92s)]
*  It's supposed to be that no one is [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2143.64s)]
*  above the law, and [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2144.7999999999997s)]
*  that we're all treated equally. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2145.72s)]
*  And justice for all, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2147.7599999999998s)]
*  you remember that, right? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2149.2s)]
*  Here, they're brazen about it. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2150.8799999999997s)]
*  They're like, if you even [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2152.48s)]
*  unwittingly, subconsciously, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2154.64s)]
*  slight Donald Trump by having [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2157.2s)]
*  the wrong picture up on your wall, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2159.04s)]
*  or whatever it might be. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2160.7599999999998s)]
*  You look at me kind of funny, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2161.96s)]
*  you're fired, you're fired. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2162.92s)]
*  I talked to somebody at a Young [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2164.3999999999996s)]
*  Turks meet and [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2165.64s)]
*  greet in Chicago today. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2166.2799999999997s)]
*  He works with the government. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2167.92s)]
*  He's like, nobody looks at each [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2169.12s)]
*  other anymore in the government [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2170.44s)]
*  offices. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2171.68s)]
*  We're all so scared. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2172.2s)]
*  And we go into work, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2173.64s)]
*  we keep our head down, and [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2174.48s)]
*  we try not to get fired. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2175.64s)]
*  because you don't know what you're [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2176.92s)]
*  going to get fired for. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2177.92s)]
*  How is that different from most [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2178.8799999999997s)]
*  people working for corporations? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2179.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, no, I hear you, but [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2181.3199999999997s)]
*  they go and do their jobs, right? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2182.56s)]
*  Yeah, I get it, yeah. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2183.8799999999997s)]
*  And so, and they're not worried [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2184.68s)]
*  about it, like Gestapo-like [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2186.2799999999997s)]
*  government officials. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2187.92s)]
*  And not just like, hey, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2190.04s)]
*  are you doing something liberal? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2191.12s)]
*  Or are you doing something [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2192.3999999999996s)]
*  extreme from the past or something? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2193.72s)]
*  No, are you sufficiently loyal to [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2195.72s)]
*  the dear leader? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2198.04s)]
*  This is how a communist [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2199.44s)]
*  dictatorship runs. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2200.56s)]
*  This is how you get the tyranny of [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2201.9199999999996s)]
*  government, etc. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2204.0s)]
*  So now, speaking of tyranny, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2205.44s)]
*  we go back to Stephen Miller. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2206.8799999999997s)]
*  So the only thing worse than [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2208.3599999999997s)]
*  Pam Bondi, whose only job is [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2210.0s)]
*  apparently is puckering up for [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2211.64s)]
*  Trump, is Miller who just said [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2213.6s)]
*  a couple of days ago that we should [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2215.68s)]
*  suspend the writ of habeas corpus. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2217.96s)]
*  But how neocon of him, by the way. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2220.8799999999997s)]
*  So first of all, yeah, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2222.6s)]
*  that is a neocon position, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2223.8s)]
*  that's right. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2225.12s)]
*  And so Stephen Miller is not [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2226.36s)]
*  a lawyer, and he goes, I know, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2228.28s)]
*  I know, yeah, it's an invasion. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2230.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it is. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2233.88s)]
*  But wait, is it an invasion or [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2235.36s)]

*  because I thought you were [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2238.96s)]
*  bragging about closing the border [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2240.04s)]
*  a minute ago. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2241.24s)]
*  And if the border is closed, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2242.08s)]
*  how's it an invasion? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2243.24s)]
*  It's only been used four times [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2244.52s)]
*  every time in actual war [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2246.52s)]
*  circumstances, right? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2248.08s)]
*  This is not a war circumstance at [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2250.04s)]
*  all, right? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2251.88s)]
*  But they're like, there is an [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2253.08s)]
*  invasion of their country, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2254.4s)]
*  we are going to suspend it. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2255.6s)]
*  So if you don't know what that is, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2257.1600000000003s)]
*  is the reason why it's cornerstone [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2258.6800000000003s)]
*  of our constitution and [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2260.32s)]
*  Western civilization is. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2261.4s)]
*  In the old days, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2263.1600000000003s)]
*  tyrannical governments and [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2264.12s)]
*  kings would just grab somebody up [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2265.6s)]
*  off their property, and [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2267.4s)]
*  they'd lock them up, and [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2268.84s)]
*  they'd lock them up forever. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2270.2000000000003s)]
*  And people say, where did he go? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2271.84s)]
*  I don't care, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2272.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't have to show you, I'm king. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2273.32s)]
*  I could be as tyrannical as I like. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2275.2000000000003s)]
*  And then through the Magna Carta, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2277.48s)]
*  the lords originally got the right [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2280.48s)]
*  to say, hey, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2282.44s)]
*  you have to show me to a judge. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2283.2000000000003s)]
*  If you're going to arrest someone, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2285.44s)]
*  you have to show them to a judge [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2286.88s)]
*  and say why you arrested them. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2288.2400000000002s)]
*  If you don't have that, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2290.5600000000004s)]
*  we're back in the dark ages. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2291.6800000000003s)]
*  We're back to total [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2293.2400000000002s)]
*  dictatorships, right? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2294.0800000000004s)]
*  Guys, look, just to give you [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2295.2400000000002s)]
*  a sense of how backwards this is [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2296.96s)]
*  and how ridiculous this is. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2299.04s)]
*  I remember during the Bush [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2302.0s)]
*  administration, he actually did [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2303.6800000000003s)]
*  suspend habeas corpus specifically [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2306.1200000000003s)]
*  for suspected terrorists. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2309.2400000000002s)]
*  And just like we're hearing today [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2311.6400000000003s)]
*  with Trump supporters who are [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2313.48s)]
*  totally on board with doing away [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2315.0800000000004s)]
*  with habeas corpus for [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2316.8s)]
*  undocumented immigrants, at the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2318.0s)]
*  time during the Bush administration, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2319.96s)]
*  the big argument was, well, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2322.32s)]
*  we're suspending habeas corpus for [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2324.0400000000004s)]
*  suspected terrorists. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2326.2000000000003s)]
*  No, no, but you need due process [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2328.6800000000003s)]
*  when the federal government [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2330.2000000000003s)]
*  unilaterally points to you or [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2331.48s)]
*  points to anybody and [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2332.92s)]
*  claims that they're terrorists. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2333.88s)]
*  You should be able to have your day [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2335.28s)]
*  in court and force the federal [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2337.52s)]
*  government to provide evidence [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2339.44s)]
*  showing that you are actually [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2341.48s)]
*  engaged in terrorist activities. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2343.56s)]
*  Okay, by the way, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2346.84s)]
*  the Supreme Court struck it down. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2347.56s)]
*  I think it took about a year, but [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2349.68s)]
*  the Supreme Court finally did [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2351.36s)]
*  strike it down. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2352.92s)]
*  So the idea of suspending habeas [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2354.16s)]
*  corpus, people think they're [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2355.84s)]
*  foreigners, who cares? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2357.56s)]
*  They have no rights. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2359.28s)]
*  First of all, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2360.08s)]
*  they do have rights. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2360.7599999999998s)]
*  This has been established by [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2361.84s)]
*  the Supreme Court multiple times. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2363.52s)]
*  Our constitutional rights extend [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2365.7599999999998s)]
*  to people who are in the country [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2367.44s)]
*  but are undocumented, okay? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2369.04s)]
*  And by the way, who's to say [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2370.52s)]
*  the federal government can't [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2372.2400000000002s)]
*  accuse someone who is an American [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2374.08s)]
*  citizen, engage in a case of [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2376.04s)]
*  mistaken identity, accuse that [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2377.7200000000003s)]
*  person of being in the country [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2379.52s)]
*  illegally, accuse that person of [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2381.0s)]
*  allegedly being a gang member. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2382.8s)]
*  And if you just suspend habeas [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2384.52s)]
*  corpus in regard to those people, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2386.2400000000002s)]
*  those American citizens wouldn't [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2388.16s)]
*  have their day in court. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2390.0s)]
*  Yeah, so last things here. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2391.48s)]
*  So going along with what Ana was [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2392.48s)]
*  saying, Supreme Court has ruled [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2394.28s)]
*  for 200 years that the rights in [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2396.32s)]
*  the Constitution apply to people [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2398.2000000000003s)]
*  that are in this country, whether [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2400.2400000000002s)]
*  they're citizens or not citizens. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2402.32s)]
*  So you could say you don't agree [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2404.36s)]
*  with that, okay? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2405.88s)]
*  But once you take that right away [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2406.76s)]
*  from citizens or non-citizens, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2408.48s)]
*  you erode your own rights. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2410.32s)]
*  Yep. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2411.92s)]
*  Because the Supreme Court has said [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2412.48s)]
*  they are the same rights. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2414.1200000000003s)]
*  Okay, so now if you say, well, no, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2415.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't think they should set [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2417.44s)]
*  a new standard and [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2418.88s)]
*  non-citizens should have no rights [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2419.76s)]
*  at all. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2421.4s)]
*  I don't care about 200 years of [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2421.96s)]
*  American history or [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2423.4s)]
*  Supreme Court decisions. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2424.4s)]
*  And it should only be for [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2425.96s)]
*  citizens. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2426.76s)]
*  Okay, well, now you're on to [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2427.1600000000003s)]
*  the second problem with due [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2428.56s)]
*  process and rid of habeas corpus. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2429.76s)]
*  If they don't have to present you [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2431.6800000000003s)]
*  to a court, you could scream from [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2433.36s)]
*  inside a dungeon in Louisiana or [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2435.1200000000003s)]
*  El Salvador, but I'm a citizen. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2436.96s)]
*  But I'm a citizen, and [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2439.84s)]
*  they won't hear you because they [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2440.96s)]
*  never had to present you to a court. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2442.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2444.04s)]
*  Look, I'll give you another [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2445.1600000000003s)]

*  My husband was born in the United [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2447.7200000000003s)]
*  States, okay, in Miami. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2450.28s)]
*  He has a name that is shared by [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2453.4s)]
*  many drug cartel members, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2455.28s)]
*  apparently. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2457.24s)]
*  And I didn't know this until I [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2458.16s)]
*  finally gathered the courage to ask [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2460.04s)]
*  customs. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2462.52s)]
*  And when you fly back to the United [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2463.16s)]
*  States from a foreign country, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2465.16s)]
*  you have to go through customs. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2466.96s)]
*  And every single time they pull him [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2469.36s)]
*  to a separate room and interrogate [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2471.4s)]

*  my time? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2480.2s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2480.72s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2481.28s)]
*  Seriously, why are they doing this [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2481.84s)]
*  every time? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2483.6400000000003s)]

*  Christian Lopez, and [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2485.76s)]
*  they admitted this to me. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2487.04s)]
*  His name's Christian Lopez. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2488.56s)]
*  There are a lot of wanted cartel [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2490.08s)]

*  we have to interrogate him. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2492.96s)]
*  Well, what if a mistake is made and [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2494.52s)]
*  there's mistaken identity and [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2496.48s)]
*  he gets accused of being one of [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2498.32s)]
*  those cartel members? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2500.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, A, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2501.6400000000003s)]
*  there could be mistakes. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2502.6400000000003s)]
*  There have already been mistakes, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2503.84s)]
*  right? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2505.48s)]
*  And there's no, the Trump [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2506.0s)]
*  administration, Biden [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2507.32s)]

*  No, that doesn't make any sense. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2512.32s)]
*  That's why we have habeas corpus. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2513.32s)]
*  That's why we have due process. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2515.4s)]

*  about his views on Israel and [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2531.7200000000003s)]
*  on Trump. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2533.2000000000003s)]
*  First of all, his views on Trump and [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2533.96s)]
*  Israel, his views on anything is [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2535.56s)]
*  irrelevant. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2537.2000000000003s)]
*  He's a US citizen, right? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2537.92s)]

*  Anna with you guys, more news. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2615.92s)]
*  Cenk, all of a sudden, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2621.08s)]
*  politicians from both sides of [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2622.92s)]
*  the political aisle really [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2625.28s)]
*  about foreign corruption of [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2628.0s)]
*  our politicians, super worried [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2629.7200000000003s)]
*  about it, wow, okay, well, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2631.76s)]
*  let's give you the details. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2633.52s)]
*  I'm not a fan of Qatar. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2635.32s)]
*  I also think that the plane poses [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2636.6800000000003s)]
*  significant espionage and [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2639.04s)]
*  surveillance problems. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2641.1200000000003s)]
*  So we'll see how this issue plays [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2642.88s)]
*  out, but I certainly have concerns. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2644.6s)]
*  Republican Senator Ted Cruz, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2648.6800000000003s)]
*  who you just heard from, is far [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2650.48s)]
*  from the only politician or [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2652.48s)]
*  even the only Republican who has [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2654.4s)]
*  speaking out against their king, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2657.3999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump, for considering [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2659.8399999999997s)]
*  accepting a $400 million plane to [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2662.2s)]
*  essentially serve as Air Force One [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2664.96s)]
*  that would be gifted by [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2667.64s)]
*  the Qatari Royals. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2669.3999999999996s)]
*  Apparently, all of a sudden, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2670.8799999999997s)]
*  you have all these conservatives [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2672.68s)]
*  who are worried about government [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2674.64s)]
*  corruption. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2676.52s)]
*  In fact, conservative media [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2677.3199999999997s)]
*  personalities, representatives and [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2678.72s)]
*  senators who seem to totally be okay [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2680.72s)]
*  with corruption in all other forms, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2682.56s)]
*  suddenly have this kind of [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2684.6s)]
*  issue with Qatar bribing one of our [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2686.04s)]
*  politicians, in this case, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2688.32s)]
*  the President of the United States. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2690.04s)]
*  Others are defending Trump, but [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2692.8s)]
*  we'll get to them later, Cenk. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2694.84s)]
*  Yeah, so, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2696.7599999999998s)]
*  the shock to find gambling in [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2697.48s)]
*  this establishment. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2699.36s)]
*  So it turns out that maybe other [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2701.0s)]
*  countries are trying to influence [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2702.8s)]
*  it. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2704.68s)]
*  I wonder if the top lobbying group [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2705.24s)]
*  in the country that has the word [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2707.4s)]

*  any of these people. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2711.6s)]
*  That's so weird. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2713.24s)]
*  That's so weird. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2714.96s)]
*  None of them mention it, and [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2716.12s)]
*  neither does the media. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2717.76s)]
*  The media that's now saying, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2719.48s)]
*  I can't believe Biden lied to us. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2721.84s)]
*  It turns out he was old. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2724.76s)]
*  What are we, reporters? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2726.1600000000003s)]
*  How could we figure that out? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2727.2000000000003s)]
*  Is that is going to say one day [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2728.76s)]
*  when they get caught on AIPAC and [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2730.36s)]
*  the fact that they never, ever, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2732.12s)]
*  ever covered the fact that AIPAC [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2733.88s)]
*  was the number one donor in [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2735.52s)]
*  this election cycle, etc. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2736.76s)]
*  They will then say, I didn't know. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2739.36s)]
*  It turns out that this lobbying [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2742.0s)]
*  group was for Israel. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2743.56s)]
*  All I knew about was bad Qatar, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2745.28s)]
*  bad Qatar. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2747.2s)]
*  So we're going to give you all [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  those details, but as we give you [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2749.88s)]
*  these folks who are pretending to [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2751.12s)]
*  care about this, I need you to [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2752.36s)]
*  remember that Qatar is home to [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2753.88s)]
*  the forward headquarters of United [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2755.56s)]
*  States Central Command in [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2757.64s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2759.16s)]
*  And it also has combined air [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2761.2s)]
*  operations center for [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2763.2s)]
*  the United States in Qatar. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2764.84s)]
*  So Qatar is an actual ally that [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2767.16s)]
*  actually allows bases in their [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2769.36s)]
*  country and has greeted us with [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2772.12s)]
*  open arms throughout. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2774.48s)]
*  But they only took care of Trump. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2777.3199999999997s)]
*  They didn't take care of Ted Cruz [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2781.52s)]
*  and all the media and [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2783.3199999999997s)]
*  all the other politicians. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2784.3599999999997s)]
*  So where's the AIPAC did? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2785.72s)]
*  And all of a sudden that's why we [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2789.48s)]
*  have concerns. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2790.6s)]
*  So here's a quick compilation of [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2791.68s)]
*  various conservatives, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2793.7599999999998s)]
*  various Republicans who take issue [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2795.48s)]
*  with the notion that Trump should [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2797.72s)]
*  accept this gift from Qatar. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2799.96s)]
*  Taking sacks of goodies from [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2803.8s)]

*  the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Jazeera, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2805.84s)]
*  all the rest. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2807.1600000000003s)]
*  That's not America first. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2808.2000000000003s)]
*  Please define America first in [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2809.48s)]
*  a way that says you should take [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2810.88s)]
*  sacks of cash from the Qatari [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2812.28s)]
*  royals who are behind Al Jazeera. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2813.84s)]
*  If you want President Trump's [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2816.04s)]
*  agenda to succeed, taking jets from [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2817.52s)]
*  Qatar is not the way. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2819.4s)]
*  Taking real estate deals from Qatar [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2821.2000000000003s)]
*  is not the way. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2822.96s)]
*  The largest obstacle to any [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2824.44s)]
*  administration is scandal. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2825.7200000000003s)]
*  Obviously, we don't want to be [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2827.12s)]
*  straight up accepting any type of [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2829.0s)]
*  gift from any foreign government. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2831.28s)]
*  Certainly not one that can be [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2834.64s)]
*  viewed in a way that obviously has [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2836.84s)]
*  been presented here. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2839.48s)]
*  I do think the jet probably sends [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2841.96s)]
*  the wrong signal to people and [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2843.68s)]
*  I don't like the look or [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2845.2s)]
*  appearance of it. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2846.36s)]
*  So I would hope that he would [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2847.64s)]
*  reject it. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2848.84s)]
*  The Constitution specifically says [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2849.68s)]
*  you can't take gifts from [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2851.36s)]
*  foreign leaders. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2852.44s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2853.28s)]
*  There's a reason that people can't [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2854.56s)]
*  even buy me a steak dinner. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2856.6s)]
*  It's not necessarily that you can [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2858.24s)]
*  prove that I've got an ethical [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2859.9199999999996s)]
*  problem. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2861.4399999999996s)]
*  It's at the appearance of it [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2862.12s)]
*  doesn't look great. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2863.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, this is the kind of [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2866.7599999999998s)]
*  discussion that typically takes [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2868.3199999999997s)]
*  place on corporate media. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2870.5s)]
*  Corporate media loves to cover [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2872.64s)]
*  political bribes 24 seven. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2874.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, the real muckrakers are in [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2877.3199999999997s)]
*  the corporate press and they like [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2879.16s)]
*  to have these conversations, Cenk. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2880.7599999999998s)]
*  They really they take issue with [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2882.3999999999996s)]
*  corruption. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2883.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2884.52s)]
*  So look, some folks are upset about [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2885.02s)]
*  the plane that have nothing to do [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2886.88s)]
*  with the hypocrisy on Israel, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2888.76s)]
*  right? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2890.44s)]
*  So I'm included among them. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2890.96s)]
*  I don't think you should take [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2893.08s)]
*  the plane. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2894.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't know why another country is [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2894.6400000000003s)]
*  giving us Air Force One. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2896.28s)]
*  That seems dangerous. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2897.28s)]
*  And the fact that Trump is going to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2899.04s)]
*  keep it after the election is [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2900.88s)]
*  ridiculous. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2902.48s)]
*  So why am I concerned about [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2903.56s)]
*  Ben Shapiro, Mark Levin and [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2905.4s)]
*  all these other guys who are Israel [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2907.44s)]
*  first, all of a sudden finding out [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2909.84s)]
*  that there might be corruption in [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2912.1600000000003s)]
*  the establishment? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2914.1600000000003s)]
*  Because they never said a word [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2915.32s)]
*  about any of the other corruption. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2916.78s)]
*  They never said a word about all [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2918.6800000000003s)]
*  the lobbying, not just from APAC, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2920.2000000000003s)]
*  but from Big Pharma and oil and [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2921.98s)]
*  the bankers and all these, they [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2923.6000000000004s)]
*  love that kind of corruption. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2925.36s)]
*  They never said a word about [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2927.76s)]
*  Trump's meme coin until all of a [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2929.0s)]
*  sudden this plane issue comes up. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2930.36s)]
*  All of a sudden Ben Shapiro finds [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2932.0800000000004s)]
*  out that Donald Trump is doing [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2933.48s)]
*  meme coin. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2934.6000000000004s)]
*  They do complain about Soros. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2935.1200000000003s)]
*  We all do. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2937.28s)]
*  Bribing politicians and all that. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2938.1200000000003s)]
*  But when it comes to Trump, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2940.28s)]
*  it was like bribe away. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2941.6400000000003s)]
*  And when it comes to all the [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2943.0s)]
*  politicians in our Congress, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2944.28s)]
*  bribe away, no problem. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2945.88s)]
*  They love that. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2947.4s)]
*  So don't tell me that all of a [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2948.6400000000003s)]
*  sudden you don't like corruption. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2949.84s)]
*  And so if you don't know [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2951.4s)]
*  the background, Qatar is not, so [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2952.52s)]
*  they are on our side. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2955.1200000000003s)]
*  They're trying to be neutral to [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2957.8s)]
*  the, and if you whether you believe [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2959.5600000000004s)]
*  them or not is a different [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2961.36s)]

*  And so since they're on the side of [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2967.7200000000003s)]
*  the Palestinians, every supporter [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2969.48s)]

*  apparently got a memo. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2972.4s)]
*  I don't know how, but they all or [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2974.2s)]

*  care deeply about, right? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2979.24s)]
*  So they're like, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2980.72s)]
*  Qatar is now unduly influencing [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=2982.0s)]

*  we care about Donald Trump's [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3001.16s)]
*  corruption. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3002.52s)]
*  We've been covering it throughout. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3003.08s)]

*  right? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3006.08s)]

*  I don't like this plain thing. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3008.36s)]

*  they don't mean a thing. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3017.4s)]
*  Qatar is definitely on [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3019.2s)]
*  the Palestinian side. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3020.24s)]
*  You had Hamas leadership living in [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3021.48s)]
*  Qatar, Qatar was harboring them. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3023.88s)]
*  I'm not saying that as if we [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3027.16s)]
*  should be enemies with Qatar. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3028.68s)]
*  No, I actually love the fact that [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3030.36s)]
*  there's a country in the Middle [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3032.36s)]

*  Yeah, and- [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3037.7200000000003s)]
*  Not harboring Hamas, but [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3038.4s)]
*  specifically that they actually [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3039.96s)]
*  give a damn about what's happening [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3042.0s)]
*  to Palestinian civilians. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3044.0s)]
*  100%, and to that point, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3045.7200000000003s)]
*  what I was going to say is that, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3047.0s)]
*  remember Netanyahu funneled money [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3048.6000000000004s)]
*  to Hamas through Qatar. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3050.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3051.96s)]
*  So all of a sudden you found out [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3052.48s)]
*  that Qatar is housing the Hamas [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3054.1200000000003s)]
*  guys, no, you knew that all along. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3055.7200000000003s)]
*  And you were pretty happy with that [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3058.0s)]
*  all along. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3059.52s)]
*  And right, you had the memo saying [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3060.04s)]
*  that October 7th was going to [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3061.7999999999997s)]
*  happen, and you didn't do anything. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3063.16s)]
*  And then look at that, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3065.8799999999997s)]
*  I had to destroy all of Gaza and [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3067.0s)]
*  try to occupy it. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3068.6s)]
*  So there's no clean hands on Qatar [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3069.8799999999997s)]
*  at all when it comes to Netanyahu [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3071.72s)]
*  and the current Israeli government. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3073.44s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3076.3599999999997s)]
*  Caitlin Collins's exchange with [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3078.52s)]
*  Representative Rich McCormick. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3080.9199999999996s)]
*  She was asking him whether or [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3083.2799999999997s)]
*  not he is comfortable with Trump [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3085.12s)]
*  accepting this $400 million gift. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3087.24s)]
*  He deflected quite a bit and [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3090.56s)]
*  wanted to talk about Israel [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3091.96s)]
*  instead, let's watch. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3093.3199999999997s)]
*  This came up for [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3095.68s)]
*  a vote in Congress, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3096.4s)]
*  would you say yes to it? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3097.52s)]
*  I don't think it's going to come [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3100.6s)]
*  down to a vote, it's not either [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3101.96s)]
*  to see it's going to be illegal or [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3103.4s)]
*  illegal, I don't think Congress by [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3104.96s)]
*  the Constitution is in charge of [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3106.7999999999997s)]
*  a budget, not in which gifts [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3108.48s)]
*  the President can accept. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3110.12s)]
*  I think that's a lawyer, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3111.84s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer, I'm a doctor. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3113.16s)]
*  I'm in Congress, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3115.08s)]
*  we're not going to vote on this. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3115.7999999999997s)]
*  They'll come up whether it's [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3117.36s)]
*  acceptable or not, that's going to [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3118.96s)]
*  remain to be seen. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3120.6800000000003s)]
*  What I'm really worried about is [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3122.0s)]
*  the peace process, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3123.44s)]
*  what's going on in Israel, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3124.4s)]
*  why it happened, how do we mitigate [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3125.84s)]
*  that from happening again? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3127.4s)]
*  But Congressman, actually, if you [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3128.6800000000003s)]
*  read the emoluments clause, it says [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3130.36s)]
*  no person holding any office shall [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3132.2400000000002s)]
*  without the consent of Congress [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3134.08s)]
*  accept of any president of any kind [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3135.8s)]
*  whatever from any king, prince or [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3137.6800000000003s)]
*  foreign state. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3139.6800000000003s)]
*  You're the reporter, could you tell [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3140.6s)]
*  me if every gift we received from [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3142.52s)]
*  the Middle East had been voted on? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3144.1600000000003s)]
*  Because I don't remember that at [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3146.04s)]
*  all, so I'm just asking- [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3147.52s)]
*  I'm saying this is the emoluments [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3148.8s)]
*  clause. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3150.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, typically presidents are [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3150.6400000000003s)]
*  not supposed to accept gifts from [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3152.44s)]
*  foreign leaders. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3154.1200000000003s)]
*  But I know we have though, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3155.2400000000002s)]
*  historically, we've accepted gifts [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3156.44s)]
*  from all over the world. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3158.0800000000004s)]
*  The question is, is there a monetary [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3159.44s)]
*  value on that? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3161.0s)]
*  I don't know, I'm not a lawyer. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3161.92s)]
*  He's correct, there have been other [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3165.4s)]
*  gifts given by foreign governments [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3167.88s)]
*  to our politicians. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3170.52s)]
*  In some cases, our politicians have [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3172.6000000000004s)]
*  been prosecuted for [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3174.8s)]
*  accepting those obvious bribes. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3176.0600000000004s)]
*  Bob Menendez, a former Democratic [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3178.64s)]
*  senator, comes to mind, right? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3180.36s)]
*  He's faced some consequences for [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3182.12s)]
*  that. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3183.68s)]
*  But let's go to one more [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3184.4s)]
*  representative, this is Ryan Zinke, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3185.7599999999998s)]
*  who tried to defend Trump. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3188.2s)]
*  I don't think it's a personal gift. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3192.6s)]
*  I think it's government to [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3194.04s)]
*  government. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3195.0s)]
*  But is that a workaround because [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3195.52s)]
*  he said it's going to go to [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3196.68s)]
*  the Trump presidential library [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3197.6s)]
*  after? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3198.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, we'll see where it goes. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3199.52s)]
*  So what do you think though? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3200.96s)]
*  Are you forward against it? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3201.68s)]
*  Where do you stand? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3202.72s)]
*  Do you have any ethics concerns or [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3203.52s)]
*  constitutional concerns? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3204.96s)]
*  I'm glad Pam Bonney stepped in and [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3206.16s)]
*  looked at it from a legal point of [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3208.0s)]
*  view, which is helpful. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3209.8s)]
*  Again, I'll go back, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3211.52s)]
*  this must be one heck of a complaint. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3212.84s)]
*  Remember who President Trump is? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3215.76s)]
*  He's a billionaire businessman from [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3217.7200000000003s)]
*  New York. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3220.2s)]
*  He doesn't sleep in a sleep [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3222.04s)]

*  if Israel gave Trump $400 million [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3284.92s)]

*  100%, you know that that would be [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3289.12s)]
*  the argument. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3291.2400000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3292.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3292.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3293.46s)]
*  And so, and for the politicians and [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3294.04s)]
*  for the media, so [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3296.76s)]
*  here's how it works. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3298.08s)]
*  If any other country gives [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3299.92s)]

*  Israel's interests, it would be, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3305.7200000000003s)]
*  okay, it's another story. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3308.2s)]
*  We'll run it for a little while and [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3309.48s)]
*  then you'll never hear about it [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3311.04s)]
*  again. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3312.44s)]
*  I mean, how do I know? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3313.0s)]
*  Because to me, one of the most [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3314.04s)]
*  egregious cases was that guy who was [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3316.12s)]
*  being investigated by the SEC and [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3318.56s)]
*  gave Trump $75 million into his [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3321.0s)]
*  media company, his fake media [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3323.28s)]
*  company. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3325.5600000000004s)]
*  And so it's a digital media, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3326.88s)]
*  they can't track it. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3328.8s)]
*  And so the 75 million goes straight [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3330.36s)]
*  into Trump's pocket, right? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3332.1600000000003s)]
*  It doesn't get any worse than that. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3334.1200000000003s)]
*  That's a $75 million bribe to get [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3335.2400000000002s)]
*  out of a fraud case, right? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3337.36s)]
*  And it barely made a peep in [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3339.8s)]
*  the national media. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3341.36s)]
*  They don't care about corruption. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3342.6400000000003s)]
*  They love corruption. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3344.36s)]
*  How many foreign leaders and [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3345.44s)]
*  foreign politicians have bought [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3347.0400000000004s)]

*  the guy I'm talking about is [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3351.88s)]
*  Chinese. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3352.88s)]
*  Yeah, how many of them have bought [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3353.48s)]
*  Trump's meme coin in order to exert [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3355.6400000000003s)]

*  Trump, guys. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3364.08s)]
*  It's not just, I want to make that [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3364.76s)]
*  clear. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3366.7200000000003s)]
*  This isn't just about the president [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3367.2200000000003s)]
*  of the United States accepting [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3369.32s)]
*  foreign bribes. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3371.08s)]
*  This has been a big problem across [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3372.08s)]
*  the board in our government. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3374.4s)]
*  And there hasn't been this fury [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3376.76s)]
*  over it until now, and [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3378.88s)]
*  that's why I'm frustrated. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3380.28s)]
*  By the way, the American people, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3382.0s)]
*  they're consistent on the matter of [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3383.96s)]
*  government corruption. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3385.96s)]
*  Because even before this story, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3387.64s)]
*  polling showed that doing something [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3389.52s)]
*  about corruption happened to be one [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3391.62s)]
*  of the top concerns for [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3393.58s)]
*  American voters. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3394.68s)]
*  Democrat, Republican, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3396.0s)]
*  it doesn't matter. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3396.96s)]
*  And so in regard to this specific [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3397.68s)]
*  issue, YouGov conducted a poll to [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3399.68s)]
*  see where the hearts and [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3401.8s)]
*  minds of Americans are. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3403.16s)]
*  Should Trump accept this $400 [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3404.72s)]
*  million bribe? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3406.68s)]
*  And 30% say that it's acceptable [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3408.12s)]
*  for him to do so. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3410.48s)]
*  But 47% say no, unacceptable, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3411.84s)]
*  whereas 23% don't really know how [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3414.7200000000003s)]
*  they feel about it yet, not sure. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3417.64s)]
*  And why is it 47%? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3420.6s)]
*  First of all, it should be, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3421.88s)]
*  it should be 100%, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3422.68s)]
*  he should not take the plane, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3423.48s)]
*  right? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3424.64s)]
*  But the reason why there's [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3425.36s)]
*  a significant plurality that is [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3426.88s)]
*  saying don't take the plane is [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3428.84s)]
*  because lots of different media are [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3430.68s)]
*  attacking at the same time. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3433.0s)]
*  You got mainstream media attacking, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3435.16s)]
*  you got portions of right-wing media [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3437.08s)]
*  attacking Fox News, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3439.04s)]
*  other politicians, etc. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3440.44s)]
*  So then it seems like everybody's [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3443.36s)]
*  unanimous, don't take the plane. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3445.2s)]
*  And they create this amazing [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3447.0s)]
*  echo chamber. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3448.52s)]
*  So back to the point about [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3449.4s)]
*  the hypocrisy. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3451.7599999999998s)]
*  So guys, when the corruption was [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3453.8s)]
*  helping Israel, no one talked about [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3455.96s)]

*  they're like, corruption. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3465.82s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik0v4Cd4AwU&t=3468.4s)]
