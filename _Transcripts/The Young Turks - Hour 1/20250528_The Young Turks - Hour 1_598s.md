# New York Post's SHAMELESS Stunt
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0)
*  A veteran reporter for the New York Post has been placed on leave after writing a damning report [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=0.0s)]
*  on President Donald Trump's pick for DEA administrator. Now, according to a report [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=7.28s)]
*  from Breaker Media, the journalist in question is business reporter Josh Cosman, who's actually a [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=13.52s)]
*  16 year veteran over at the New York Post. And as you guys can imagine, New York Post's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=20.88s)]
*  conservative leaning, he's been there for 16 years. And he apparently received a tip [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=26.8s)]
*  within the drug enforcement agency in late February, alleging that Donald Trump's pick [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=33.92s)]
*  to lead the DEA, a guy by the name of Terry Cole, had a checkered pass that included [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=39.04s)]
*  leading to operations that led to unnecessary deaths. Now, that sounds serious. That seems [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  like an interesting tip. He looked into it and he says it was a pretty amazing scoop, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=51.28s)]
*  he explained to Breaker. Cosman briefed multiple editors at the post, including the business, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=56.16s)]
*  features and political editors, who all encouraged him to pursue the story. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  Now, he was able to get two sources to even speak to him on the record, in addition to over a dozen [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=67.12s)]
*  DEA top officials, former DEA top officials. But after it was written jank, after it was edited, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=73.6s)]
*  and slated to run on Sunday, March 22nd, all of a sudden the publishing of this piece was postponed, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=81.2s)]
*  they didn't do it. And eventually Cosman received an email from the post political editor saying, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=88.0s)]
*  there's no good way to say this, so I'll just say it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Keith Poole spiked the story. I sent him the most recent copy and his response was nope, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=97.12s)]
*  not running this. In a way that made clear there was no changing his mind. I'm very sorry. I thought [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=103.2s)]
*  we had the story, but sometimes decisions are made above my pay grade. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=109.36s)]
*  Now, Cenk, here at TYT, I think people feel pretty free to say what they actually think, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=115.36s)]
*  especially in regard to news stories. I think you have a pretty reasonable red line. You don't want [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=120.64s)]
*  people who work for you going around calling you a bitch, for instance. But freedom of opinion is [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=126.32s)]
*  obviously something that's allowed here. But I'm starting to think we might be one of the only [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=134.0s)]
*  places where that's allowed. Yeah, for sure. So look, let's do general rules, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=138.32s)]
*  then we'll talk about us and New York Post a little bit. So first off, everyone has a bias. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=144.0s)]
*  And so all media should be honest about their perspective. But mainstream media isn't, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=151.12s)]
*  they're the most dishonest out of all of the media. And so I wanna be clear about who mainstream [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=158.72s)]
*  media is and why I'm calling them the most dishonest. Because I'm not saying that they [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=164.32s)]
*  make up the most amount of lies. Can you find a right wing show that just makes up nothing but [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=168.32s)]
*  lies? Yeah, of course. Alex Jones is a mess. We're not winning with Alex Jones, right? Let alone [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=172.0s)]
*  a hundred other shows, right? But you know which side Alex Jones is coming from, Cuckoo Land, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=178.48s)]
*  right? You know which side the right wing shows are coming from, left wing shows, etc. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Mainstream media says, it does two problems. One is me, bias, no. My perspective is objective. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=187.92s)]
*  And so I'm going to privilege my own perspective, which is almost always for the status quo, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=197.11999999999998s)]
*  the establishment and corporate rule. And I'm going to pretend that it's the objective position. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=202.48s)]
*  That is the worst of all scenarios. Then mainstream media has a second problem. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  There's right wing embedded within mainstream media like Fox News, New York Post, etc. Certainly [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=213.12s)]
*  the editorial section of the Wall Street Journal, by the way, all of those owned by Rupert Murdoch. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  And so they hilariously pretend to be neutral and objective when they're not just in favor of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=223.44s)]
*  corporate rule like the rest of mainstream media, which they are. That's what they share, right? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  They love the status quo. They love corporate rule. That's why the Murdoch companies are always [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=234.72s)]
*  a little skittish about Trump even, right? And my God, do they despise Bernie Sanders. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=240.88s)]
*  They loathe outsiders, populists, etc. But on top of that, layered on top of that, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=245.92s)]
*  for the Murdoch companies, including New York Post, they're just brazenly right wing, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=252.32s)]
*  And right wing, it's socially, economically, etc. And so that's why in this case, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=259.28s)]
*  Trump has said, I like this Keith Poole guy at New York Post. Murdoch should put him in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=267.12s)]
*  charge of the Wall Street Journal. Why? Cuz he's like Trump loves how biased he is, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=272.16s)]
*  and how he'll kiss Trump's ass and bury stories that might go against Trump. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=277.68s)]
*  So I need you to understand that the New York Post is a piece of trash. It's useless, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=283.2s)]
*  absolutely utterly useless. It's in fact counterproductive, cuz it puts out nonsense [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=288.32s)]
*  propaganda. Even if you're in the right wing, remember, they barely tolerate Trump. This is [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=294.72s)]
*  for giant corporate propaganda, okay? So in this case, they trashed this perfectly good piece. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  But look, if you're in the right, this piece was not political. The things that he found out about [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  this person who was being nominated was apparently enormous incompetence that got people killed. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  So why would you not wanna know that? Why don't you just pick a different right winger [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=321.84s)]
*  who is not enormously incompetent? But with Donald Trump, no, he's trouble thin skin. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=326.32s)]
*  And so he just cannot ever, ever, ever tolerate being wrong about anything. So when they spike [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=333.84s)]
*  this story and they bury the truth, Trump's gonna love it, and that's why they did it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=340.88s)]
*  Now, we're never gonna know exactly what was written in Cosman's piece. However, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  a day before Cole's Senate Judiciary hearing, a different publication broke the story, right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=353.36s)]
*  A similar article with a similar subject matter. So we get a sense of what was [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  likely gonna be reported by the New York Post, but that story got spiked. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=365.44s)]
*  So CNN wrote on April 29th, years ago, the Drug Enforcement Administration was shaken by a pair [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=370.64s)]
*  of particularly deadly overseas incidents. A botched operation by a US vetted Colombian [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=378.8s)]
*  police squad that left 10 local officers dead and a cartel's brutal retaliation in a small [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=384.96s)]
*  Mexican town that killed dozens. The first of the deadly overseas incidents noted in the letter came [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=391.36s)]
*  in 2006 in Bogota, where Cole was stationed as a special agent, according to his online resume. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=398.8s)]
*  An elite group of 10 anti-narcotic Colombian police officers who were polygraphed by the DEA [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=406.64s)]
*  as part of its vetting process and worked directly with Cole, according to agents who [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=413.36s)]
*  served with him, were gunned down by a platoon of Colombian soldiers later convicted of working [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=418.88s)]
*  for drug traffickers. So according to CNN in 2011, Cole was working in the DEA's field office [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  in Dallas supervising a probe into the leadership of the Mexican drug cartel known as the Zetas. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=433.6s)]
*  And in early 2011, the Zetas carried out a mass murder that was later the subject of a year long [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  investigation published jointly by ProPublica and National Geographic. That report found that the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  border region violence was sparked when DEA officials shared intelligence produced by [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=452.96s)]
*  Agent Cole or produced by an Agent Cole supervised with Mexican federal police, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=459.68s)]
*  who then leaked it to the cartels. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=466.56s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, going back to what you said, Cenk, incompetence is a perfect word. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=468.88s)]
*  And that incompetence is something that the Senate should be aware of as they're considering [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=473.44s)]
*  confirming this guy as DEA administrator. But I guess the New York Post didn't think so. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  But luckily, CNN ended up reporting the story. Any final words on this? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=486.32s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. So look, I always think shoe on the other foot. If it was Bernie and he's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=490.23999999999995s)]
*  putting this guy in charge, I'd want to know. So don't put that guy in charge. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=496.4s)]
*  And by the way, if you're on the right, you like that this guy's information got to a drug cartel [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=500.08s)]
*  and then the drug cartel did a massacre with that information. Why is that a right-wing position? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=504.08s)]
*  That's not a right-wing position at all, right? That's just, okay, I love Donald Trump. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=508.88s)]
*  And if Daddy Trump picked this incompetent loser who got people killed and accidentally [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=513.52s)]
*  helped a Mexican drug cartel, then I'm gonna be in favor of Daddy. Okay, if that's your position, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=518.0s)]
*  have at it, boss. But that's not principle that doesn't make any sense. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=523.04s)]
*  Last thing I said, what are our standards here? Look, there's three simple standards that, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=526.32s)]
*  to me, make sense for any news organization. One is you cannot play with the facts. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=531.28s)]
*  Yeah, we did tell people, our hosts have different positions. I'm on the left, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=535.84s)]
*  I'm an economic populist. No one is confused about that. Everybody knows it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=542.0s)]
*  In fact, I'll say it and then people on the left won't even believe it. They're like, no, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=546.72s)]
*  I don't care, something else. All right, I don't really care. So they can go do whatever the hell [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=550.08s)]
*  they want. But you cannot play around with the facts. I don't care what your ideology is. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=554.08s)]
*  Facts are paramount. If it's they're not paramount in a news organization, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=560.0s)]
*  it's not a news organization, okay? Number two, you're not allowed to call for violence. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=563.76s)]
*  And number three, you're not allowed to do rando weirdo attacks against your colleagues. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=568.0s)]
*  These are not complicated rules. They make a lot of sense. I wish all news organizations had this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9uhCrkmH0&t=572.88s)]
