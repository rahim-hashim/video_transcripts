"Jon Stewart let ABC have it over the firing of ABC News anchor Terry Moran, which he called ‚Äúso stupid‚Äù on his Weekly Show podcast Thursday.
‚ÄúThey shouldn‚Äôt have fired him,‚Äù Stewart said in the episode, responding to a listener‚Äôs question about whether the network made the right call in axing Moran over his social media comments about Stephen Miller. ‚ÄúThe entire thing is because ABC clings to this facade that they somehow exist in a bubble outside all of this. It‚Äôs a joke. They‚Äôre a f***ing joke.‚Äù

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Jon Stewart SLAMS ABC News For Firing Reporter
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Terry Moran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=0.0s)]
*  And for almost 28 years, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=2.24s)]
*  I was a reporter and anchor for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  ABC News. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=6.32s)]
*  And as you may have heard, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=7.44s)]
*  I'm not there anymore. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=9.42s)]
*  Do you think ABC should have fired [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=11.28s)]
*  Terry Moran over his Steven Miller [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=13.42s)]
*  tweet? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=15.64s)]
*  Of course not, so stupid. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=16.2s)]
*  ABC News senior national [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=21.44s)]
*  correspondent Terry Moran was fired [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=23.0s)]
*  from the network earlier this week [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=25.28s)]
*  for a since deleted post that he [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=27.32s)]
*  made calling out Trump's deputy [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=29.36s)]
*  chief of staff, Steven Miller. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=31.419999999999998s)]
*  And people have some very strong [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=33.96s)]
*  thoughts on the situation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  In the since deleted post, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=37.68s)]
*  Moran wrote, the thing about [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=39.0s)]
*  Steven Miller is not that he is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=40.46s)]
*  the brains behind Trumpism. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=42.08s)]
*  He is one of the people who [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=44.16s)]
*  conceptualizes the impulses of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  the Trumpist movement and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=47.36s)]
*  translates them into policy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  But that's not what's interesting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=50.76s)]
*  about Miller, it's not brains, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  it's bile. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Miller is a man who is richly [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=55.28s)]
*  endowed with a capacity for hatred. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=56.84s)]
*  He's a world class hater. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  You can see this just by looking at [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  him because you can see that his [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  hatreds are his spiritual [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=65.52s)]
*  nourishment. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  He eats his hate. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=67.96s)]
*  Trump is a world class hater, but [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=69.36s)]
*  his hatred is only a means to an [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=71.64s)]
*  end and that end is his own [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=73.84s)]
*  glorification. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=75.8s)]
*  That's his spiritual nourishment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=77.72s)]
*  Moran was originally just [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=79.64s)]
*  suspended for the post, but later [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=81.28s)]
*  he was given the official boot [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=83.56s)]
*  two days later. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=85.4s)]
*  So Cenk, is this a fireball offense, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=86.8s)]
*  especially for a reporter? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=88.84s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=90.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so at all. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=91.48s)]
*  I'm curious what Michael thinks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=92.56s)]
*  I don't know if we're going to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=93.84s)]
*  agree or disagree here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=95.2s)]
*  I agree with John Stewart [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  completely. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=98.36s)]
*  So the idea here is that reporters [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=98.92s)]
*  are supposed to be neutral and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=103.28s)]
*  I don't agree with that idea. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=104.64s)]
*  I think the reporters are supposed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=106.16s)]
*  to be objective. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=107.48s)]
*  Those are two different things. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=108.56s)]
*  So neutral is, well, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Stephen Miller could be full of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=112.36s)]
*  hate or he could be full of love. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=115.04s)]
*  But he's not, the truth is not in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  the middle. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=120.12s)]
*  He's not full of love at all. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=120.84s)]
*  He is full of hate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=122.4s)]
*  And so do you guys remember when [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=123.64s)]
*  Mago was super mad at reporters [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=127.84s)]
*  criticizing Joe Biden or [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=131.56s)]
*  other Democrats? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=134.36s)]
*  because I don't remember that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=136.36s)]
*  But now all of a sudden when [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=138.0s)]
*  beloved Trump is criticized, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=139.8s)]
*  how dare you? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=142.0s)]
*  So I see a lot of irony and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=143.12s)]
*  hypocrisy here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  But I am curious, Michael, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=146.76s)]
*  what your take on it is. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=148.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=149.68s)]
*  it's their own networks. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=150.28s)]
*  It's not about Mago being upset [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=151.28s)]
*  about it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=152.76s)]
*  It's about ABC being upset because [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=153.28s)]
*  a reporter would have criticized [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=155.28s)]
*  Biden and you didn't see that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=157.24s)]
*  I don't think it's fireable, but [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=159.04s)]
*  I definitely, and I lean more [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=160.76s)]
*  towards a responsibility. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=162.52s)]
*  If you have Terry Moran's beat and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  you're covering the White House and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=165.92s)]
*  you're covering Congress and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=167.92s)]
*  you're covering politics and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=169.68s)]
*  you have for a long time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=171.28s)]
*  I do think that you have to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=172.48s)]
*  hew toward objectivity as much as [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=173.76s)]
*  you can. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=175.52s)]
*  I don't think that there's any, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  I wouldn't give reporters the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=178.84s)]
*  ability to tweet their personal [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=181.0s)]
*  feelings about things, but to share [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=183.16s)]
*  their stories and share their [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=185.56s)]
*  reports is one thing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=187.62s)]
*  So I would understand a network [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=189.56s)]
*  saying we just can't do that, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=191.28s)]
*  because we're going to show a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=193.0s)]
*  little bit too much about that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=194.6s)]
*  I also would have reassigned Terry [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  Moran in the worst case, right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  I would have said, okay, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=199.88s)]
*  you're going to now tell [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  different stories. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  You're not going to be posted to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  the White House. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  So I do think that there's some, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  that there's a little violation [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  from Terry Moran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=209.84s)]
*  But he's also got a long, long [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=211.4s)]
*  career of being an objective [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=213.4s)]
*  reporter at a network that has made [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  some very questionable decisions [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=217.36s)]
*  lately that I disagree with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=219.44000000000003s)]
*  wholeheartedly. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=221.08s)]
*  So I would always take the side of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  Moran there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  So I don't think he should have [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=225.24s)]
*  been fired, but I do see reason to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=226.52s)]
*  get upset with him if you're his [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=228.24s)]
*  boss and to maybe pull him off [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=229.84s)]
*  a beat and put him someplace else. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=231.52s)]
*  But firing him is silly, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=233.68s)]
*  in my opinion. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=235.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, let's get to some [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=237.4s)]
*  details on this story. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=238.8s)]
*  So according to Maria Bartiromo on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=240.08s)]
*  Fox News, this was all spurred by [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=241.96s)]
*  a post that Miller made about [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=243.8s)]
*  the details about the big, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=245.44s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  It's unclear if that's actually [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  what happened as Miller. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=249.8s)]
*  He was also mass posting about [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=251.08s)]
*  the LA protests at the same time. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=252.8s)]
*  But on Tuesday, ABC News stated [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=254.88s)]
*  that it was at the end of Moran's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  contract, which was originally [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  set to expire today. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=260.88s)]
*  And so they just decided not to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=262.72s)]
*  renew it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=264.32000000000005s)]
*  They also said that the decision [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=265.6s)]
*  was based on Moran's post being in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=267.44000000000005s)]
*  violation, like what Michael said, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  of ABC News policies. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=271.48s)]
*  So in their original statement [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  regarding his suspension, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=274.88000000000005s)]
*  they told CNN's Brian Stelter, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=276.56s)]
*  ABC News stands for objectivity and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=278.42s)]
*  impartiality in its news coverage [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=280.48s)]
*  and does not condone subjective [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  personal attacks on others. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=284.44000000000005s)]
*  The post does not reflect the views [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=286.32000000000005s)]
*  of ABC News and violated our [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  standards. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=290.12s)]
*  As a result, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  Terry Moran has been suspended [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=292.12s)]
*  pending further evaluation. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=293.96s)]
*  And again, of course later he was [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=295.96s)]
*  fired. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=297.8s)]
*  And as we stated earlier, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=298.32s)]
*  many people had thoughts about this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  whole situation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  So here is Vice President [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=302.76s)]
*  JD Vance. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  This is what he posted on X. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=305.56s)]
*  He said, ABC journalist Terry [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=307.56s)]
*  Moran posted this absolutely vile [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=309.4s)]
*  smear of Stephen Miller. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=311.44s)]
*  It's dripping with hatred. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=313.12s)]
*  Remember that every time you watch [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  ABC's coverage of the Trump [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=316.36s)]
*  administration, as it happens, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=317.79999999999995s)]
*  I know Trump well. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=319.64s)]
*  He's motivated by the love of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  our country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  He's motivated by a fear that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=323.24s)]
*  people like Terry Moran make rules [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=324.96000000000004s)]

*  without laughing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=333.6s)]

*  President Trump elected and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=336.84000000000003s)]

*  hard to implement the agenda. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=339.64s)]
*  ABC should apologize to Stephen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  What Terry posted is disgraceful. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=343.6s)]

*  Democratic politicians and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=462.23999999999995s)]
*  all kinds of other things. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=463.56s)]
*  The entire thing is because ABC [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=465.16s)]
*  clings to this facade that they [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  somehow exist in a bubble outside [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=470.48s)]
*  of all of this, it's a joke. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=473.32000000000005s)]
*  They're a joke. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=476.8s)]
*  And the problem with it all is [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=478.20000000000005s)]
*  there's no level of fealty that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  is enough. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=481.0s)]
*  You've seen him attack Fox News [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=481.92s)]
*  that is literally like a 24 hour [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=483.56s)]
*  Trump ball polishing machine. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=485.32000000000005s)]
*  And so the idea that somehow there [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  is a level of fealty that these [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=489.12s)]
*  journalists, what does he always [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=490.52000000000004s)]
*  say whenever he gets asked a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=492.0s)]
*  question? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=493.16s)]
*  That's a terrible question. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=493.68s)]
*  Why don't you ever just thank me? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=494.64s)]
*  In other words, just another one of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=497.4s)]
*  your cabinet members. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=499.36s)]
*  All right, well, Stewart wasn't [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=503.4s)]
*  the only left leaning media figure [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=505.08s)]
*  to call out ABC, Medi Hasan posted [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=506.88s)]
*  this after the suspension, said, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=508.68s)]
*  snowflakes, pretend free speech [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=510.56s)]
*  warriors, getting journalists [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=512.4s)]
*  suspended and calling for [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=514.16s)]
*  their firing hypocrites. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=515.56s)]
*  All right, well, Stewart makes some [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=518.1999999999999s)]
*  interesting points. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=519.76s)]
*  First, the $15 million, ABC's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=520.72s)]
*  decision to fire Moran comes months [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=522.68s)]
*  after the network reached a $15 [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=524.6s)]
*  million settlement with Trump. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=526.4s)]
*  Stemming from a lawsuit that Trump [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=528.36s)]
*  launched over George Stephanopoulos, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=530.32s)]
*  stating that Trump was found [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=532.64s)]
*  civilly liable for [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=534.2s)]
*  raping E. Jean Carroll, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=535.28s)]
*  which was an inaccurate assertion. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  But Stewart also makes a good point [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=539.16s)]
*  about Moran's character. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=541.12s)]
*  So let's look at this clip from [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=542.84s)]
*  an interview that Moran did with [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=544.52s)]
*  Donald Trump back in April. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=546.36s)]
*  So during this interview, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=548.44s)]
*  Moran hit Trump hard with the facts [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=549.84s)]
*  regarding Kilmar, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=551.72s)]
*  Diego Garcia and his tattoos and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=552.88s)]
*  Trump attacked him just for [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=554.76s)]
*  asking the question. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=556.52s)]
*  He had MS-13 on his knuckles. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=558.96s)]
*  He had some tattoos that are [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=561.64s)]
*  interpreted that way, but [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  let's move on. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=563.76s)]
*  Wait a minute, Terry, Terry, Terry. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=564.44s)]
*  He did not have the letter MS-13. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  It says MS-13. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=569.0s)]
*  That was Photoshopped. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=570.72s)]
*  So let me just- [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=572.2800000000001s)]
*  That was Photoshopped, Terry. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=574.08s)]
*  Hey, they're giving you the big [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=575.24s)]
*  break of a lifetime. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=576.32s)]
*  You're doing the interview. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=577.52s)]
*  I picked you because frankly, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=578.52s)]
*  I never heard of you, but [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=580.12s)]
*  that's okay. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=581.0s)]
*  I picked you, Terry, but [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=581.88s)]
*  you're not being very nice. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=583.4s)]
*  He had MS-13 tattooed- [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=585.4s)]
*  We'll agree to disagree. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=587.0s)]
*  He did have tattoos that can be [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=587.8399999999999s)]
*  interpreted that way. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=589.0s)]
*  I'm not an expert on them. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=590.12s)]
*  I want to turn to Ukraine. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=591.0799999999999s)]
*  No, no, Terry, no, no. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=592.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=594.4799999999999s)]
*  He had MS as clear as you can be, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=595.4799999999999s)]
*  not interpreted. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was Photoshopped. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=602.16s)]
*  So anyway, like many other news [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=603.4s)]
*  anchors who we have seen be let go [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=605.28s)]
*  due to their political stances for [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  major networks, Moran has since [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=609.3199999999999s)]
*  made the jump over to Substack. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=611.7600000000001s)]
*  He will continue his reporting over [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=613.5200000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  And yeah, so we lost one. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=616.2s)]
*  That interview clip with Moran and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=618.36s)]
*  Trump, that went viral because it [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=620.36s)]
*  was so ridiculous. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=622.36s)]
*  And Moran, I gave him a lot of [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=623.44s)]
*  credit at the time for just [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=625.5600000000001s)]
*  not just correcting, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=627.5200000000001s)]
*  constantly correcting Trump, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=629.08s)]
*  trying to move on. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=631.32s)]
*  And then Trump correcting him back, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=632.5200000000001s)]
*  which only made Trump look more and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  more just like a little, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=636.6s)]
*  I'm trying to find a nice word for [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=638.12s)]
*  what I'm trying to say. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=640.16s)]
*  But just like he has no idea what's [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=641.68s)]
*  going on. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=643.16s)]
*  So I don't know if there is [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=643.68s)]
*  a nice word for what I'm trying to [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=644.68s)]
*  say. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=646.04s)]
*  Yeah, so Michael, let's get to you. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=646.54s)]
*  I know you have a lot of thoughts [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  on whether or not this was a [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  justified firing on behalf of ABC. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=653.48s)]
*  Because a lot of times, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=655.8s)]
*  and like here on TYT, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=657.36s)]
*  we're an independent network. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  But there is a balance that we're [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=660.36s)]
*  always trying to strike, right? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=662.12s)]
*  You have to give people the facts. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=663.96s)]
*  You want people to have all [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=665.96s)]
*  the necessary pertinent information [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=667.36s)]
*  whenever you're presenting a story. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=669.28s)]
*  And then you commentate on it, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=671.44s)]
*  right? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=673.08s)]
*  We do that here at TYT, but [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=673.58s)]
*  the things are a little bit [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=675.2s)]
*  different at some of these bigger [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=676.76s)]
*  major corporate media outlets. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=678.6800000000001s)]
*  So what do you have to say about [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=681.0s)]
*  that? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=681.96s)]
*  Well, I don't like how the network [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=682.46s)]
*  handled that settlement with George [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=683.88s)]
*  Stephanopoulos issue. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=685.52s)]
*  I don't like even the way they [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=687.2s)]
*  reacted to the Terry Moran thing [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=688.64s)]
*  coming out and saying, well, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=690.32s)]
*  he was at the end of his contract. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=691.8s)]
*  I mean, stand by what you are doing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=693.6s)]
*  if you're going to do what you [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=695.24s)]
*  are doing, right? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=696.6s)]
*  Don't just say, well, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=697.48s)]
*  we're at the end of his contract, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=698.4s)]

*  We're just not going to renew it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=700.6s)]
*  That's fine, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=701.84s)]
*  that's your prerogative. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  But if you're going to make [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  a statement about the objectivity, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=704.76s)]
*  about the truth of your journalism [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=706.9599999999999s)]
*  and about the code that you have to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  live by to be at ABC. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=711.0s)]
*  But again, Terry Moran is not this [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=712.88s)]
*  rogue journalist and [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=714.84s)]
*  this is the eighth time he's done [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=715.92s)]
*  something and finally this was [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=717.64s)]
*  a straw that broke the camel's back. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=719.24s)]
*  He's a solid reporter. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=720.72s)]
*  He is somebody who, like you said, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=722.24s)]
*  Yaz, when he interviewed [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=724.0s)]
*  President Trump, did a very good [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=725.24s)]
*  job in pushing back on him in that [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=727.12s)]
*  interview. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=729.2800000000001s)]
*  It is an opportunity that a lot of [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=729.84s)]
*  people have dropped. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=732.2800000000001s)]
*  People have gone in there and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=733.96s)]
*  the office itself when you do an [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=735.84s)]
*  interview in the Oval Office, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  it is just by definition very, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=740.08s)]
*  very imposing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=742.24s)]
*  I thought he did a great job. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=743.5200000000001s)]
*  I would have just made a statement [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=745.2800000000001s)]
*  about what he said. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=747.32s)]
*  I would not have fired him. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=748.6s)]
*  I would have maybe, like I said [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=750.0400000000001s)]
*  earlier, reassigned him, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  reassigned him for a while until [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=753.2s)]
*  the thing blew over a little bit. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=755.0s)]
*  But part of what these networks [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=757.12s)]
*  try and strive for and fail a lot [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=760.64s)]
*  is to be totally objective. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=764.24s)]
*  And then again, when Levitt or [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=767.84s)]
*  whoever it was that was talking [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=769.2800000000001s)]
*  about Fox, John Stewart, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=770.6800000000001s)]
*  I think talking about Fox, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=771.84s)]
*  I don't think comparing ABC and [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=773.0s)]
*  Fox is necessarily fair. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=774.4s)]
*  ABC's mission is different than [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=775.96s)]
*  Fox's mission. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=777.6s)]
*  And I get why it's easy to go [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=778.76s)]
*  there, it's low hanging fruit. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=780.6s)]
*  And sometimes it's worth taking [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=782.24s)]
*  the low hanging fruit. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  But I do think that there's [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  something different that ABC's [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  trying to establish. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=787.56s)]
*  The way ABC has handled themselves [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=788.52s)]
*  with both Stephanopoulos and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=790.52s)]
*  now with Moran, I just think has [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=792.14s)]
*  been very, very sloppy at best. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=793.76s)]
*  Yeah, I want to say something at [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=795.56s)]
*  the end where I'm making you think [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=797.24s)]
*  about, wait, could ABC have been [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=800.76s)]
*  But first, let me tell you all [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=801.4s)]
*  the ways they're wrong, okay? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=802.7199999999999s)]
*  But before I even get to that, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=804.4399999999999s)]
*  JD Vance's- [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=806.1999999999999s)]
*  Sorry, yeah, JD Vance, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=807.36s)]
*  you're going to talk about it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=809.76s)]
*  To say that Terry Moran, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=812.64s)]
*  are you going to say, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=813.88s)]
*  makes the rules? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=814.9599999999999s)]
*  Is that what you're going to say? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=815.92s)]
*  No, that's a different one. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=816.64s)]
*  Okay, Terry Moran makes the rules [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=817.64s)]
*  that normal Americans don't have [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=819.4799999999999s)]
*  to follow, but [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=821.36s)]
*  well-connected people don't. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=822.4799999999999s)]
*  Can you think of any administration [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=824.28s)]
*  in American political history that [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=826.7199999999999s)]
*  doesn't protect the well-connected [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=829.0799999999999s)]
*  and make them not have any rules [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=831.4399999999999s)]
*  to follow? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=833.24s)]
*  It's just absurd. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=833.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't know what happened to JD [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=835.0s)]
*  Vance where he just buys into this [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=836.8399999999999s)]
*  or he projects in that way. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=838.7199999999999s)]
*  But sorry to interrupt you, but [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=840.28s)]
*  yeah, that Terry Moran makes [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=841.9599999999999s)]
*  the rules, huh? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=843.36s)]
*  Yeah, so I had a similar reaction [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=844.5200000000001s)]
*  to the second half of that line. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=846.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=848.5200000000001s)]
*  Well-connected people, hmm, okay, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  let's break that down. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  There are 13 billionaires in [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=853.36s)]
*  Trump's administration. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=855.2800000000001s)]
*  But JD Vance himself, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=856.8800000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you why he's doing it, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=858.0s)]
*  because he's a giant liar and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=859.5600000000001s)]
*  hypocrite. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=860.96s)]
*  You know who's a well-connected [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=861.8000000000001s)]
*  person? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=863.36s)]
*  JD Vance, he was polling in [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=863.96s)]
*  the single digits in the Ohio [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=865.6s)]
*  Senate race until the guy he's [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=867.36s)]
*  connected to, Peter Thiel, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=869.24s)]
*  gave him $10 million for [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=871.22s)]
*  that race, and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=873.4s)]
*  that's why he won that race. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=874.4s)]
*  JD Vance would not have been in any [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=876.48s)]
*  of our lives if he wasn't well [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=878.8s)]
*  connected to a Silicon Valley [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=880.88s)]
*  funder like Peter Thiel. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=883.2s)]
*  I mean, that is the height of irony [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=885.4s)]
*  to say that line. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=887.84s)]
*  Okay, now back to the other [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=889.28s)]
*  hypocrisies that they have. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=891.24s)]

*  Scarlin, not relevant. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=903.48s)]
*  Mr. Freedom of Speech, Trump, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=906.52s)]
*  Vance, all bag out, all those guys [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=908.64s)]
*  are like, you said something mean [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=911.0799999999999s)]

*  in media, okay? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=926.8s)]
*  Grow up, so what? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=928.3199999999999s)]
*  And the reality is, of course, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=930.76s)]
*  they caught feelings because of [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=932.52s)]
*  that interview. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=934.4s)]

*  anything super aggressive, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=937.64s)]
*  that the letters MS and [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=939.4s)]
*  the number 13 were photoshopped in [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=940.78s)]
*  the picture that Trump showed. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  So Moran's trying desperately to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=945.2s)]
*  get past it, but he needs to do a [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=946.88s)]
*  fact check. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=948.4s)]
*  They're photoshopped, but [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=949.2s)]
*  let me move on, and they're like, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=950.44s)]
*  no, I'm not going to let you move [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=952.0s)]
*  on, and they keep saying dumb [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=953.52s)]
*  things. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=955.12s)]
*  It was photoshopped, you moron, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=956.4s)]
*  he's trying to help you by moving [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=958.68s)]
*  on, right? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=960.88s)]
*  Terry Moran hurt my feelings, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=961.8s)]
*  cancel him, I want him canceled. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=964.52s)]
*  What happened, guys? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=967.76s)]
*  I thought you were against [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=970.8399999999999s)]
*  cancel culture. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=971.68s)]
*  So the hypocrisy of the right wing [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=973.12s)]
*  on this is even larger, okay? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=975.12s)]
*  So now, last thing to make you [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=977.8s)]
*  think a little bit, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=981.0s)]
*  if Terry Moran had or any journalists [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=983.04s)]
*  had tweeted out, Barack Obama is [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=987.24s)]
*  a world class hater. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=990.44s)]
*  And is picking person in his [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=992.96s)]
*  administration, and [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=995.48s)]
*  Valerie Jarrett filled with hate, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=997.88s)]
*  etc. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1001.2s)]
*  Would they have been fired? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1002.6800000000001s)]
*  And the answer is probably, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1004.44s)]
*  I mean, that's my sense of it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1006.08s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1008.16s)]
*  I would agree, I mean, we don't [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1008.84s)]
*  know, but I would agree. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1010.32s)]
*  Like in the hypothetical, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1011.36s)]
*  I'm sure that would have been [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1012.64s)]
*  the case because there's [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1014.0s)]
*  hypersensitivity to that as well. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1015.16s)]
*  So yeah, I would agree. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1017.88s)]
*  So my point there is not, okay, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  they should be fired for [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1021.1999999999999s)]
*  saying it about Obama, but [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1022.56s)]
*  not about Trump. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1024.0s)]
*  My point is have consistent rules. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1025.08s)]
*  And I believe that the reporters [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1027.68s)]
*  hiding their opinions doesn't [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1029.8799999999999s)]
*  really help. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1031.24s)]
*  I think that if we know their [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1032.36s)]
*  opinions, but then they try really [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1033.68s)]
*  hard to be objective in the context [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  of their job. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1036.96s)]
*  I think that that is more authentic, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1038.32s)]
*  more real, more honest than hiding [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1039.96s)]
*  your opinions and pretending that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1042.2s)]
*  you have none when we all know you [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1044.6s)]
*  do, so- [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1046.36s)]
*  You do, but Cenk, don't you think [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1047.44s)]
*  that if you were a news [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1049.44s)]
*  organization like ABC News and [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1051.04s)]
*  you said to listen to all your [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1053.28s)]
*  reporters, your correspondents, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1055.32s)]
*  your anchors, hey, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1057.72s)]
*  you can tweet your stories. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1058.96s)]
*  You can tweet teases to your [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1060.76s)]
*  stories. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1062.24s)]
*  You can tweet that you're [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1062.76s)]
*  a Red Sox fan, but there's no [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1064.2s)]
*  opinion and don't share opinions [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1065.8799999999999s)]
*  about anything else that's [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1067.8799999999999s)]
*  happening on things that you cover. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1069.56s)]
*  Do you think that's appropriate? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1072.08s)]
*  Well, look, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1074.8s)]
*  we had that situation here. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1075.3999999999999s)]
*  So our standard was when we had [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1076.6s)]
*  a great reporting team, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1078.84s)]
*  Jonathan Larson, Ken Klippenstein, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1080.6s)]
*  a lot of great reporters went [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1083.32s)]
*  through here. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1085.24s)]
*  And our standard was, you could [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1086.28s)]
*  just have any opinion you like. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1088.36s)]
*  Ken tweeted hilarious things all [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1090.56s)]
*  the time, he very strongly [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1092.9199999999998s)]
*  opinionated, etc. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1094.72s)]
*  But when you're writing your story, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1096.72s)]
*  you have to be objective. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1098.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm not interested in your opinions [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1100.52s)]
*  in the middle of their [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1102.52s)]
*  investigative reporting piece. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1103.8799999999999s)]
*  And we cared a lot about being [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1106.12s)]
*  objective in our reporting, but [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1107.8799999999999s)]
*  we didn't hide the fact that we [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1109.8s)]
*  had opinions otherwise. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1111.5s)]
*  So that's how I- [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1112.8s)]
*  But everybody has opinions, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1114.36s)]
*  like you said. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1115.56s)]
*  And I'm just saying that the Turks [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1116.24s)]
*  and ABC News for several reasons [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1118.28s)]
*  are different. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1120.4399999999998s)]
*  Can I tell you one other amazing [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1122.12s)]
*  thing actually, kind of burying [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1123.84s)]
*  this really interesting fact here. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1125.8s)]
*  So I ran into a former ABC reporter [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1128.1999999999998s)]
*  just like two days ago, no, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1130.6399999999999s)]
*  yesterday, literally yesterday. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1133.1200000000001s)]
*  And we were talking and they said [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1135.2s)]
*  that ABC told them while they were [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1137.68s)]
*  there, that they were not even [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1140.28s)]
*  allowed to go on dating apps. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1142.76s)]
*  So that's- [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1146.28s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1147.2s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1148.0s)]
*  And that person was young when [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1149.1200000000001s)]
*  they were there and they're like, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1150.8s)]
*  what do you want me to do? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1152.8s)]
*  That's how people meet each other [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1154.2s)]
*  these days, right? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1155.76s)]
*  It's like saying don't go to a bar, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1156.96s)]
*  like it's crazy, right? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1158.8s)]
*  But that cuts in both directions [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1160.92s)]
*  because I think ABC's way too [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1162.6s)]
*  stringent on these rules. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1165.12s)]
*  On the other hand, apparently [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1167.48s)]
*  they're really stringent on [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1169.32s)]
*  the rules. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1170.9599999999998s)]
*  So maybe the terror and [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1171.52s)]
*  Moran firing is not as out of [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1172.8799999999999s)]
*  places we thought. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1174.52s)]
*  I don't know, like going back to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1176.84s)]
*  what you guys were talking about [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1178.04s)]
*  earlier, I like not to use myself [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1179.4399999999998s)]
*  as an example for this. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1181.08s)]
*  But for me, especially whenever I [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1182.48s)]
*  was doing my podcast, I would [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1184.52s)]
*  always say, this is the story. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1186.24s)]
*  You'll know how I feel about it, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1188.04s)]
*  but my feelings about it aren't [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1190.08s)]
*  the whole story, right? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1191.8799999999999s)]
*  And again, even whenever I'm [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1193.36s)]
*  presenting here and this isn't me, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1194.9599999999998s)]
*  this is how we just do things here [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1196.9599999999998s)]
*  at TYT. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1198.6799999999998s)]
*  We give you the facts first, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1199.8799999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1201.04s)]
*  We say, okay, here it is, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1201.56s)]
*  here's the story and [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1202.56s)]
*  then we'll discuss it. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1203.52s)]
*  And a lot of times we don't agree [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1204.9199999999998s)]
*  with each other whenever we're in [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1206.28s)]
*  those discussions, but [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1207.56s)]
*  that comes out. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1208.6s)]
*  And that's what people tune in for [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1209.24s)]
*  because you want to hear those [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1210.9199999999998s)]
*  different perspectives. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1212.36s)]
*  And it kind of goes back to one of [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1213.56s)]
*  our commenters who was talking [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1215.3999999999999s)]
*  about the different styles of [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1217.1599999999999s)]
*  the different presenters and [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1218.8799999999999s)]
*  things like that. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1220.52s)]
*  I do think we have a good diverse [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1222.04s)]
*  team here, but [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1223.68s)]
*  there's a reason for that. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1224.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not just, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1225.8s)]
*  it's by design largely. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1226.68s)]
*  I assume Cenk, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1228.52s)]
*  he can confirm that for me. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1229.32s)]
*  But you want to have different [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1230.9199999999998s)]
*  perspectives and different people [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1232.44s)]
*  with different ways of conveying [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1234.2s)]
*  information to people. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1235.84s)]
*  Because somebody's going to [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1237.08s)]
*  resonate with one presenter and [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1238.2s)]
*  somebody's going to resonate with [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1239.48s)]
*  somebody else. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1240.84s)]
*  But as long as you start from that [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1241.6399999999999s)]
*  baseline of fact, I wouldn't feel [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1243.1599999999999s)]
*  comfortable if that wasn't what we [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1244.9199999999998s)]
*  were doing here. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1246.9199999999998s)]
*  100%. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1247.8s)]
*  So never play with the facts. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1250.8s)]
*  And that is very much true in [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1252.8s)]
*  the news stories that we present to [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1255.8s)]
*  you guys. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  Not just the written stuff that [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1260.1599999999999s)]
*  Jonathan, Ken and others did here, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1261.84s)]
*  but also in what we do. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1263.68s)]
*  First, we give you the facts and [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1265.24s)]
*  the facts are non-negotiable. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1266.52s)]
*  And a lot of times people on our [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1268.12s)]
*  own side have gotten very mad at us [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1269.68s)]
*  because we didn't change the facts. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1271.56s)]
*  Sorry, even if it's inconvenient, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1274.0s)]
*  we're going to stick with what is [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1276.08s)]
*  true. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1277.6399999999999s)]
*  That is the base. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1278.2s)]
*  Then you begin the conversation [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1279.44s)]
*  about those facts. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1281.64s)]
*  And then is it a good thing to [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1283.5600000000002s)]
*  have diversity of thought? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1285.0s)]
*  I mean, I would say, of course. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1286.52s)]
*  And that is why we have a wide [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1289.0400000000002s)]
*  range here at TYT. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1290.3200000000002s)]
*  And again, some people don't like [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1291.3200000000002s)]
*  that and say, no, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1292.92s)]
*  it should be a really narrow range, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1293.76s)]
*  my range, right? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1295.44s)]
*  But we don't do that. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1296.8000000000002s)]
*  We keep the range large enough [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1297.76s)]
*  that you guys can see what's right [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1299.92s)]
*  for you. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1302.1200000000001s)]
*  Because we're all different human [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1303.2800000000002s)]
*  beings. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1305.24s)]
*  Once you get the facts and [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1306.16s)]
*  you hear the different sides, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1307.1200000000001s)]
*  then you make up your own mind. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1308.52s)]
*  And I think that's the way it [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1310.04s)]
*  should be. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1310.84s)]
*  And if there weren't different [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1311.4s)]
*  sides, you wouldn't be able to say [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1312.6s)]
*  you're 100% wrong. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1313.92s)]
*  Yeah, and that's fun to say. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1315.64s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1316.92s)]
*  Also, Terry Moran, probably not [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1317.44s)]
*  100% wrong here. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1320.92s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, I mean, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1323.48s)]
*  we didn't comment on it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1324.64s)]
*  Bottom line. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1325.64s)]
*  The comment itself was 100% [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1326.68s)]
*  correct, right? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1328.92s)]
*  And that's the other thing. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1330.76s)]
*  I believe his comment was [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1332.1200000000001s)]
*  objective. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1333.24s)]
*  Right, one man's objectivity. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1335.84s)]
*  Right, I'm kind of kidding about [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1337.96s)]
*  that. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihHq4hV06o&t=1340.16s)]
