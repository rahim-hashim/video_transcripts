# Cenk Interviews Philly District Attorney Larry Krasner Ahead of CONTENTIOUS Primary - April 28, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs)
*  Candoms for Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=0.0s)]
*  Hot dog is my favorite meat. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2.0s)]
*  Well, hello. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3.72s)]
*  Well, the young Turks, the online new show, Cenk, you're Jordan Yule with you guys. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=30.0s)]
*  Exciting day, 100, first 100 days for Donald Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=49.64s)]
*  So exciting, I wonder how he did. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=53.08s)]
*  Well, we're gonna give you an update on that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=55.08s)]
*  And then we've got a lot of different fun topics for you guys today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=58.04s)]
*  Democrats of young guard versus old guard, we're gonna talk about that, of course. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=62.48s)]
*  And then various disasters under Donald Trump, including now sending American citizen children [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=68.4s)]
*  abroad, deporting them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=74.64s)]
*  Without of course, as always, due process. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=78.12s)]
*  So lots of disasters. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=81.2s)]
*  And then, you know how we're doing more interviews now at 8 o'clock Eastern after the main two [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=82.72s)]
*  hour show is over. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=87.18s)]
*  Today Larry Krasner, DA in Philadelphia, kind of a legendary progressive prosecutor. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=89.3s)]
*  So that should be a super interesting conversation in a lot of different ways. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=96.76s)]
*  So don't miss that one. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=100.34s)]
*  All right, my brother Jordan Yule is on rebel headquarters, of course, where he is a bit [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=101.82s)]
*  of a murderer. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=107.3s)]
*  And he's also the host of the insurgents podcast. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=108.98s)]
*  I mean, you're killing it, so hence, you're a murderer. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=111.06s)]
*  All right, Jordan, how you doing, brother? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=117.62s)]
*  You know, I'm doing all right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=122.58s)]
*  We've got some really fun ones that I'm excited for the story at the end of the hour where [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=124.82s)]
*  you and I might have a little bit of a disagreement. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=129.18s)]
*  No, me and you have a disagreement? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=132.38s)]
*  Okay, that'll be fun. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=134.74s)]
*  Let's get to it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  All right, so let's do the first story. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=139.94s)]
*  These numbers are just horrible. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=141.94s)]
*  There's no way to sugarcoat it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=143.1s)]
*  41% approval now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=144.66s)]
*  It was 44% back in 2017 around the 100-day mark. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=146.54s)]
*  You see the 41%, that is 12 points below Joe Biden. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=150.7s)]
*  That's three points below where he was in his first term. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=154.42s)]
*  Look at where Obama was, 63%. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=156.7s)]
*  He's 22 points below that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=158.34s)]
*  And George W Bush, at this point in 2001, he is, I mean, again, 21 points below. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=159.94s)]
*  And as you pointed out in your opening, Jessica Dean, I look back at all of the polling we [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=165.82s)]
*  possibly could long before I was born. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=170.18s)]
*  And Trump's 41% at 100 days is the worst on record. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=172.82s)]
*  Tomorrow will mark President Donald Trump's 100th day in office. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  And according to that CNN poll, the American people aren't happy with how Trump has kicked [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=185.34s)]
*  off his second term. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=189.9s)]
*  There is a lot more data and more interesting numbers to discuss, including some data on [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=191.74s)]
*  how the 2026 midterms are shaping up. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=197.14s)]
*  First, Cenk, what are your thoughts on that first clip? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=199.78s)]
*  Yeah, he's hurt, dog. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=203.42s)]
*  Don't ask him if he's all right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=205.34s)]
*  And then later in the show, we're gonna show you some of the things he's backpedaling out [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=206.66s)]
*  of because it's such a disaster. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=210.1s)]
*  But for the purpose of this story, what I'm interested in is what is driving down his [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=213.02s)]
*  numbers? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=219.74s)]
*  Because in the beginning of his term, his numbers are actually pretty good. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=220.74s)]
*  And for Trump, they were quite terrific. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=223.62s)]
*  And they've taken a massive turn in the last couple of months. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=226.54s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=230.26s)]
*  I think that's really interesting. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=231.26s)]
*  We'll get to that in a sec. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=232.5s)]
*  So the two issues that Trump focused his campaign on, immigration and the economy, have fallen [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=235.44s)]
*  out from underneath him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=241.16s)]
*  But according to that poll, Americans still think he's doing a good job handling one issue. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=242.74s)]
*  Let's watch more. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=247.9s)]
*  There's only one data point where Trump is above 45%. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=250.18s)]
*  When it comes to his handling of gender identity policy, he's at 51%. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=254.34s)]
*  Every other issue, immigration, where he has long been above water, look at this below [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=258.98s)]
*  water, 45%. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=263.46s)]
*  How about the economy? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=265.1s)]
*  My good disgrace is he was elected to fix the economy, just 39%. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=266.58s)]
*  And of course, the tariff war, 34% on that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=270.22s)]
*  I mean, the bottom line here is just very simply, the numbers for Donald Trump are awful, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=273.82s)]
*  awful, awful in this poll. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=279.62s)]
*  And then of course, you look again on the economy, we compare it to where we were back [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=282.06s)]
*  in 2017. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=286.82s)]
*  You see the 49% there, look here, 39%, 10 points below. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=287.82s)]
*  And Donald Trump on the economy here, it's not just the lowest for this term, it's the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=294.98s)]
*  lowest for any president on record 100 days into a presidency. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=298.46s)]
*  Now Americans aren't just unhappy over how Trump is handling the issues. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=305.82s)]
*  They're also unhappy with how he's using his authority. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=309.82s)]
*  According to CNN's polling, in December of last year, 46% of Americans had no confidence [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=313.97999999999996s)]
*  Trump would use his presidential power responsibly. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=319.7s)]
*  That number has jumped to 54% of Americans now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  That's more bad news for Trump. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=327.0s)]
*  According to an aggregate of three polls, Trump isn't just dragging down his own numbers, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=329.61999999999995s)]
*  he's also putting House Republicans in a tough spot for 2026. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=333.78s)]
*  There's more on that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=338.06s)]
*  If the House GOP is under any illusions that Donald Trump's fall in the polls won't bring [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=339.06s)]
*  them down as well, well, they are living on fantasy island. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=346.14s)]
*  What are we talking about here? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=349.82s)]
*  Let's take a look at the generic congressional ballot, Democrats versus Republicans. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=351.14s)]
*  We have three polls out within the last few weeks. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=355.22s)]
*  What do they all show? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=357.82s)]
*  They all show the Democrats up by two points in the CNBC poll, the Fox News poll that was [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=358.98s)]
*  out on Friday. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=363.74s)]
*  Look at that, Democrats up by seven. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=364.74s)]
*  The New York Times poll that was out this Friday as well, Democrats by three. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=366.38s)]
*  Where are we seeing it? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=370.7s)]
*  We've spoken about it, Mr. Berman. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=371.7s)]
*  We're talking about independence. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  This is how you know that Trump is bringing down the House GOP. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=374.94s)]
*  Look at Trump's net federal rating. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=378.5s)]
*  In October of 2024, according to New York Times, it was minus nine points. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=380.06s)]
*  Look at where it is now, minus 30 points among independents. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=383.58s)]
*  That's horrific. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=386.62s)]
*  That's historically awful. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=387.62s)]
*  So I went back through history, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=388.62s)]
*  And I looked at the opposition minority party. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=390.38s)]
*  That of course is the Democrats right now. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=392.46s)]
*  There are minority in the House to the opposition of the party in the White House. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=394.42s)]
*  Donald Trump, a Republican. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  The average House seats won by the opposition minority party 234 when leading the generic [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=398.78000000000003s)]
*  ballot this early by at least four percentage points that happened in 2006 and 2018. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  Unsurprisingly Trump is unhappy with those bad numbers and he took to Truth Social to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=413.02000000000004s)]
*  vent about it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  Writing, great pollster John McLaughlin, one of the most highly respected in the industry [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=420.02s)]
*  has just stated that the failing New York Times poll and the ABC Washington Post poll [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=425.61999999999995s)]
*  about a person named Donald J Trump, me, are fake polls from fake news organizations. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=432.17999999999995s)]
*  The New York Times has only 37% Trump 2024 voters and the ABC Washington Post poll has [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=439.14s)]
*  only 34% Trump voters. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=445.78s)]
*  They haven't even heard of numbers unless looking for a negative result, which they [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=448.58s)]
*  are. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=452.34s)]
*  These people should be investigated for election fraud and add in the Fox News pollster while [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=453.34s)]
*  you're at it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=458.9s)]
*  They are negative criminals who apologize to their subscribers and readers after I win [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=460.09999999999997s)]
*  elections big, much bigger than their polls showed I would win. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=466.14s)]
*  Loose a lot of credibility and then go on cheating and lying for the next cycle only [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=471.26s)]
*  worse. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=477.14s)]
*  They suffer from Trump derangement syndrome and there is nothing that anyone or anything [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=478.3s)]
*  can do about it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=482.94s)]
*  I wish them well, but we'll continue to fight to make America great again. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=484.38s)]
*  Now in the New York Times poll that John McLaughlin referenced, 38% of respondents voted for Trump, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=490.62s)]
*  38% voted for Kamala Harris and 16% didn't vote in the last election. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=497.38s)]
*  So the poll was in fact, evenly distributed. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=502.97999999999996s)]
*  The ABC Washington Post Ipsos poll is a similar case. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=506.98s)]
*  35% of respondents voted for Trump, rounded up, 35% voted for Harris and 30% didn't vote [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=511.22s)]
*  in the last election. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=518.14s)]
*  So Jake, it seems balanced, just seems like Donald Trump doesn't like the results. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=519.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple of issues here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=524.22s)]
*  First, let's talk about Trump's reaction because this is usual buffoonish. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=526.14s)]
*  So he misspells the word loose. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=531.4200000000001s)]
*  He says he means lose and he says loose. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=535.2199999999999s)]
*  No one corrects it, he doesn't correct it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=538.3s)]
*  I know it's not a big deal, except the president shouldn't be a child and he shouldn't rant [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=540.8199999999999s)]
*  in the middle of the night. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=546.0999999999999s)]
*  And he should have staffers who check to make sure he gets things right. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=547.0999999999999s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=551.2199999999999s)]
*  We all got used to the fact that he's spells like a third grader, he talks like a third [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=552.9s)]
*  grader. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=558.2199999999999s)]
*  And I know that that's advantages in some ways. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=559.2199999999999s)]
*  And then he says Donald J Trump, that's me. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=564.82s)]
*  Everybody knows it's you. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=567.3000000000001s)]
*  Everybody knows it's you. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=569.22s)]
*  And so the fact that folks haven't gotten tired of what a buffoon he is in that sense, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=571.1400000000001s)]
*  it's greatly frustrating, right? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=577.86s)]
*  And so now when it comes to the important matters. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=579.94s)]
*  So they should be investigated for election fraud. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=594.82s)]
*  Brother, the next election isn't for like a year and nine months. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=605.4200000000001s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=609.34s)]
*  And this stupid, stupid idea he has in his head, if somebody writes something bad about [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=610.94s)]
*  me, it's election fraud. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=616.5s)]
*  That's not a thing, man. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=619.0600000000001s)]
*  If that was true, we'd have no freedom of the press. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=620.0600000000001s)]
*  The first amendment would be in the trash. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=622.34s)]
*  And so no, or freedom of speech. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=624.82s)]
*  So when Biden was in mental decline, if anyone said he was in mental decline, should they [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=627.82s)]
*  have been locked up for election fraud? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=632.6600000000001s)]
*  Cuz that's Trump's dumb ass idea here. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=635.1800000000001s)]
*  If you insult the president, the elected president, no, it's not. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=638.74s)]
*  You're a stupid politician. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=643.14s)]
*  We get to insult you all we want. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  We get to criticize you all we want. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=646.38s)]
*  And stop crying for God's sake, man. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=648.3000000000001s)]
*  Pull yourself together. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=650.98s)]
*  So then secondly, this isn't even criticism. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=652.54s)]
*  This is just a poll. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=656.14s)]
*  And I'm so sick of politicians on definitely on both sides. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=657.9s)]
*  Whenever they're winning, they're like, we look at the polls, we're up, we're up, right? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=661.98s)]
*  Whenever they're losing, I tell them polls don't matter. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=666.54s)]
*  They're on polls. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=668.5s)]
*  They're just numbers. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=669.86s)]
*  Sometimes they're a little off. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=670.94s)]
*  Sometimes they're more off than we hoped for. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=672.5s)]
*  Sometimes they're exactly on. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=674.66s)]
*  But overall, they give you a snapshot. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=675.9s)]
*  It's not the end all be all. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=677.62s)]
*  Elections are end all be all. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=678.98s)]
*  So is the snapshot accurate here, whether every single number is or not, that Trump [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=679.98s)]
*  is declining? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=686.4200000000001s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=687.4200000000001s)]
*  Okay, so let's say that he's not losing independence by 30. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=688.4200000000001s)]
*  He's losing him by 27. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=691.7s)]
*  Does that make you feel better if you're a Trump supporter? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=693.4200000000001s)]
*  What difference does it make? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=696.5s)]
*  It's wildly off. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=697.58s)]
*  He's only losing independence by 23 points. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=698.78s)]
*  And by the way, it could be the other way. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=701.14s)]
*  What if it's off in the other direction and he's losing him by 37, right? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=703.26s)]
*  Okay, fine, say 23. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=706.4200000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=708.3s)]
*  His poll numbers are definitely going down. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=710.42s)]
*  It's the same polls that before when he was finally above 50% in the beginning of his [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=712.42s)]
*  term, the Republicans were celebrating. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=717.54s)]
*  And the same Henry Enton segments on CNN when he was showing really good poll numbers for [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=720.5799999999999s)]
*  Trump. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=726.3399999999999s)]
*  And of course, back then the Democrats were like, no, I don't believe it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=727.3399999999999s)]
*  I don't believe any poll. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=729.2199999999999s)]
*  If Kamala Harris is losing, I don't believe any poll. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=730.2199999999999s)]
*  Now all of a sudden the Democrats are back to believing Trump is back to not believing. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=732.8599999999999s)]
*  So Ken, guys, if you're a viewer or a voter out there, etc, please stop listening to politicians, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=736.82s)]
*  right? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=742.1s)]
*  So just take a look at the same poll and what's the trend, right? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=743.1s)]
*  Back in the beginning of his term, his trend was pretty good. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=747.38s)]
*  He was doing better than he did in his first term. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=750.7s)]
*  And it made sense. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=754.32s)]
*  He just won the popular vote and he did a couple of things. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=755.32s)]
*  Now we get to why they're going down. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=757.86s)]
*  He did a couple of things in the beginning that were actually very popular. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=760.0200000000001s)]
*  And again, if you're a Democrat, I know, that's it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=762.9000000000001s)]
*  You hate me forever, cuz I said that Trump did something that was popular in the beginning. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=764.86s)]
*  Go ahead, go nuts, okay? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=769.86s)]
*  But we're gonna just keep telling the truth here at The Young Turks. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=771.22s)]
*  So when he closed down the border, whether you like it or not, it was very popular with [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=774.14s)]
*  the American people, right? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=778.1s)]
*  And the economy seemed to, it was good because Biden had an economy that was doing pretty [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=779.34s)]
*  well and we talked about that a lot. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=783.62s)]
*  Okay, so what went wrong? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=785.14s)]
*  Well, he started going nuts. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=786.9s)]
*  So both sides don't understand that most of the voters are not in your bubble. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=789.3s)]
*  They're not in your bubble. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=796.66s)]
*  So by the way, there's a number in that poll that you showed. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=798.3s)]
*  There's the only thing that Trump is still popular on is transports. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=801.0999999999999s)]
*  Sorry, okay, there's a bubble on the left that thinks no, that's not the case. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=806.14s)]
*  It is the case, okay? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  It's the only thing he's holding on to. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=813.3s)]
*  Okay, so then you look at the right wing. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=815.3s)]
*  No, I mean, Trump and all the things he's doing poorly on, that's a much longer list, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=818.54s)]
*  okay? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=823.5799999999999s)]
*  So he's now underwater on immigration. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=824.5799999999999s)]
*  He closed the border, he was so overwhelmingly popular on immigration a minute ago. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=827.06s)]
*  And now why is he underwater? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=832.5799999999999s)]
*  Because he's going unconstitutional. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=834.5s)]
*  What was the need to go unconstitutional? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  Why did you have to get rid of due process, the cornerstone of Western civilization? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=839.4599999999999s)]
*  Why are you constantly ignoring the courts? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=843.6999999999999s)]
*  Why are you ignoring the Constitution? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=845.38s)]
*  This is exactly what I talked about in my debates with conservatives before the election [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=847.38s)]
*  about Trump. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=850.98s)]
*  Like, you hate the establishment, why are you voting against Trump? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=851.98s)]
*  Because Trump, forget the establishment, forget the current corrupt system. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=855.5s)]
*  First of all, he's not doing anything about that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=858.66s)]
*  All he's doing is he's about to do another $5 trillion at a minimum of tax cuts for the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=860.74s)]
*  establishment, total fake populace. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=865.46s)]
*  But on top of that, my number one concern was the Constitution, because he said, if [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=868.04s)]
*  I lose, we should terminate it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=872.14s)]
*  Massive fraud, everything with him is massive fraud. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=874.22s)]
*  So I get to burn the Constitution, I get to arrest people without due process, and I want [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=878.54s)]
*  to stop anyone from criticizing me or polling me, right? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=884.5799999999999s)]
*  No, that's not how it works, and your infantile mind doesn't understand that, okay? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=888.02s)]
*  And I'm talking about Trump here and not his voters. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=893.22s)]
*  So he lost people on immigration, an issue he had massive support on, because he always [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=895.42s)]
*  goes too far, always. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=900.5799999999999s)]
*  And why is he going too far? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=902.14s)]
*  Because he's, golly, geez, really determined to keep America safe? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=903.54s)]
*  No, he's always testing the boundaries of his power. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=907.38s)]
*  We're going to talk about that a little bit in the next story. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=910.0999999999999s)]
*  You're on the show, obviously watch Live 68 PM, get all the stories. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=913.06s)]
*  But he's, can I run for a third term? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=917.5999999999999s)]

*  Because he loves power. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=929.04s)]
*  He's obsessed with power. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=932.02s)]
*  Me Trump, me Trump. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=933.62s)]
*  That's like him in a nutshell, right? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=935.9s)]
*  Finally, 39% on the economy. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=938.8199999999999s)]
*  What a buffoon. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=942.38s)]
*  I mean, Biden handed you record low unemployment. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=943.38s)]
*  And by the way, in the first term before COVID, he done well on unemployment. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=947.42s)]
*  We're a fair show, we give you actual facts. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=951.42s)]
*  This isn't about partisanship, okay? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=953.46s)]
*  He had done well on unemployment in the first term before COVID. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=955.9s)]
*  Now, he's got, we're worried about unemployment going up because of the tariffs. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=959.06s)]
*  We're worried about inflation going up because of the tariffs. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=964.38s)]
*  We're worried about the stock market. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=966.8199999999999s)]
*  We're worried about the bond market. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=967.8199999999999s)]
*  We're worried about average Americans having to pay higher prices. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=968.9799999999999s)]
*  That used to be his pillar. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=972.7399999999999s)]
*  The economy was the strongest part of his polling for the entirety of his career. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=976.7399999999999s)]
*  And now that's in the toilet. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=982.8599999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=984.7399999999999s)]
*  Because people didn't vote for this. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=985.7399999999999s)]
*  They didn't vote for global nuclear tariffs. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=988.14s)]
*  They didn't vote for higher prices. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=990.5400000000001s)]
*  They voted for lower prices. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=991.74s)]
*  He's in his bubble where he's like, yeah, everyone around me, Stephen Miller, Steve [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=993.82s)]
*  Bannon, everybody else. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=997.02s)]
*  We're all such extremists, so people love radical extremists, don't they? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=998.34s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1002.94s)]
*  No they don't. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1004.46s)]
*  They just wanted lower inflation, low prices, and they wanted the border shut down. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1005.46s)]
*  So the reason why, and this is more news for Trump supporters. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1010.16s)]
*  If you're bewildered why these numbers are lower, it's not complicated. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1016.22s)]
*  Because you might think these radical ideas are awesome, and the Constitution, take it [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1021.82s)]
*  or leave it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1028.06s)]
*  But the overwhelming majority of Americans do not think that. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1029.06s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1032.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what's so interesting about these polling numbers. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1033.46s)]
*  It's not necessarily that his base is turning on him. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1038.66s)]
*  I think they're just gonna stick with him in the long run. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1040.58s)]
*  It is the people who didn't vote who are most interesting to me, and I'd be curious [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1044.38s)]
*  to see breakouts. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1049.9s)]
*  But you gotta imagine that this downward shift in these approval ratings on these different [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1051.0s)]
*  issues comes from people who don't have strong affinity or loyalty for Trump and the MAGA [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1056.74s)]
*  movement. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1063.22s)]
*  They wanna see some sort of change on these issues specifically like the economy on prices. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1064.38s)]
*  Trump made that the bedrock of his campaign. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1070.98s)]
*  And now that he's in office, he's telling people, no, it's not that bad. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1073.58s)]
*  Egg prices aren't that high. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1077.3s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1078.46s)]
*  Profits for the largest egg manufacturer in the country tripled. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1080.1399999999999s)]
*  Profits tripled, not revenue, profit, pure profit, year over year. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1085.86s)]
*  So they are exploiting an avian flu and keeping prices high to justify or to continue to [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1090.96s)]
*  enrich their investors and their executives at the cost of working people. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1098.98s)]
*  And Trump doesn't care. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1104.5s)]
*  He'll just try to lie to the American consumer base saying, no, it's not that bad. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1105.5800000000002s)]
*  He loosely kind of threatened auto manufacturers, don't raise prices, and then turned around [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1111.6200000000001s)]
*  a couple days later and said, I don't care if they do because of these tariffs. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1117.14s)]
*  He is creating these problems and rising prices through a haphazard implementation of tariffs [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1120.8200000000002s)]
*  that most economists say will not work and will not achieve the desired outcome that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1128.14s)]
*  he and his team, which is largely comprised of people who are just yes men, think it will. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1133.6200000000001s)]
*  So I guess I'm not surprised that these numbers are going down because they don't know what [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1140.3000000000002s)]
*  they're doing. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1144.6200000000001s)]
*  They're doing things that will deliberately inflame these problems. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1145.6200000000001s)]
*  And no one is in his circle. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1148.7800000000002s)]
*  No one's close enough to steer him in the right direction or steer him in a better direction. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1150.7800000000002s)]
*  The one thing that's just kind of ludicrous that people are at 51%, that's I wouldn't [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1155.7s)]
*  say overwhelming, but barely approve of is just gender identity, which none of that affects [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1160.3400000000001s)]
*  our material conditions. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1168.3400000000001s)]
*  None of that affects people's kitchen table issues, doesn't help them make ends meet. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1169.3400000000001s)]
*  That's just pure animus. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1173.22s)]
*  So if that's all they can hang their hat on, good luck. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1174.9s)]
*  But when it comes time for midterms, as they talked about later in that segment, that's [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1177.9s)]
*  not gonna be enough to win. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1181.98s)]
*  So Trump has been in this situation before. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1183.46s)]
*  He got into office by promising people a lot of things, couldn't deliver. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1186.16s)]
*  There was voter backlash and they lost in midterms. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1190.3400000000001s)]
*  So hopefully it's a repeat of the same situation. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1193.78s)]
*  All right, last couple of things here. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1197.38s)]
*  First, as the founder of Rebellion PAC, I'll say if you actually care about all the issues [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1199.5s)]
*  like higher wages, lower drug prices, all the economic populism that Trump promised [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1204.54s)]
*  but never delivered, go to RebellionPAC.com. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1211.26s)]
*  We're running candidates who actually will deliver as Democrats. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1214.06s)]
*  And although independents have also signed the populist plank, which is on TYT.com slash [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1217.8999999999999s)]
*  populist plank, including Dan Osborne, a great independent out in Nebraska. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1222.4399999999998s)]
*  Now, a last set of polls here. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1226.06s)]
*  66% of Americans find Donald Trump's terms so far chaotic. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1228.6999999999998s)]
*  59% find it scary. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1234.8999999999999s)]
*  So I'm gonna get to more in a second. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1239.58s)]
*  But this is why, this is why he's lost popularity. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1241.48s)]
*  This is why the Republicans have lost popularity. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1245.22s)]
*  They're doing unpopular things that are extreme and people are finding it chaotic and scary, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1247.6999999999998s)]
*  including a significant number of Republicans, speaking of which. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1253.6999999999998s)]
*  So when they asked about the sending US citizens to El Salvador, I know if you're a certain [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1258.46s)]
*  portion of MAGA, I know he didn't say send homegrown citizens to El Salvador. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1264.28s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1269.36s)]
*  Okay, by the way, half of them are like, yeah, of course you should send them to El Salvador. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1270.96s)]
*  And half of them are like, no, he didn't say that, because that's embarrassing if he said [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1274.8799999999999s)]
*  that. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1278.96s)]
*  And I'm talking about hardcore MAGA. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1279.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, the independents left the building already and MAGA doesn't even realize it. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1281.3999999999999s)]
*  So to that point, on that issue, overall on Americans, should he be allowed to send people [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1285.8s)]
*  to US citizens to El Salvador without due process, as he has said definitively that [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1290.98s)]
*  he wants to? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1296.3799999999999s)]
*  10% of Americans say yes, 73% of Americans say no, no, hell no. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1297.3799999999999s)]
*  11% of independents say yes, 73% of independents say no. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1304.7s)]
*  Good news, you're only losing independence by 62 points in that case. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1309.5s)]
*  And finally, how about Republicans? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1314.3799999999999s)]
*  They're still on board with him, right? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1316.1399999999999s)]
*  No, even among Republicans. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1317.98s)]
*  Only 21% said yes to that harebrained scheme, and 56% said hell no. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1320.3799999999999s)]
*  And then there's some that are in the middle. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1327.5s)]
*  So why? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1329.98s)]
*  Why would you talk about sending American citizens to a foreign dungeon? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1332.3s)]
*  Why are you kidnapping people off the streets because they criticized Israel? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1336.3799999999999s)]
*  And again, later in the program, even Chuck Schumer's like, what are you doing? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1340.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm worried about anti-Semitism, but you're cutting off money to Harvard, you're [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1346.0600000000002s)]
*  kidnapping people off the streets. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1350.6200000000001s)]
*  No, don't do that. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1352.66s)]
*  In fact, seven Jewish senators wrote a letter to Trump saying, what are you doing? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1355.18s)]
*  No one in Israel is, this is crazy. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1359.7800000000002s)]
*  And that's the problem with Donald Trump. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1362.38s)]
*  He is, as my dad says, the crazy, and he can't help himself. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1364.14s)]
*  So look, we have a poll, I'm curious how you guys vote. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1369.7800000000002s)]
*  This is where I'm 100 days from. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1374.02s)]
*  Better than expected, worse than expected, or what you expected. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1375.02s)]
*  And I gotta say, unfortunately, and this is why I voted against him, this is exactly what [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1378.22s)]
*  I expected. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1382.94s)]
*  I'd vote C, okay? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1383.94s)]
*  So people say worse, at least what is it, 6% say better? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1385.5s)]
*  Okay, how could this be better? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1388.94s)]
*  Even if you're a MAGA, really better than you expected? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1391.22s)]
*  Okay, you wanted higher prices, you're super psyched about that? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1394.6200000000001s)]
*  You hated the Constitution and you love that he keeps threatening to take away giant chunks [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1398.16s)]
*  of it? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1402.7s)]
*  Okay, have at it, hoss, but the rest of the country has left the building. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1403.8600000000001s)]
*  All right, we're gonna take a break here. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1407.46s)]
*  We'll take the break, read some of your comments during the social break, of course, as we [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1410.5800000000002s)]
*  usually do. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1413.8600000000001s)]
*  And then when we come back, we're gonna talk about that issue that I was telling you about, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1415.02s)]
*  which is Trump running for a third term. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1419.5800000000002s)]
*  So what does he say about it now? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1423.8600000000001s)]
*  And why is he saying that? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1425.9s)]
*  That's very interesting, we'll be right back. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1428.06s)]
*  All right, back on TYT, Cenk and Jordan with you guys. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1433.7s)]
*  Also JG214, thank you for joining, brother, we appreciate it. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1451.26s)]
*  They hit the join button below and see how gifted a Young Turks membership on YouTube [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1455.06s)]
*  and thereby became an American hero. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1459.18s)]
*  All right, Jordan, what's next? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1460.8600000000001s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1463.5s)]
*  I've had more people say, please run again. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1464.5s)]
*  They said we have a long way to go before we even think about that. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1469.5s)]
*  But I've had a lot of people. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1472.5s)]
*  People are asking me to run and there's a whole story about running for a third term. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1474.5s)]
*  I don't know, I never looked into it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1478.5s)]
*  They do say there's a way you can do it, but I don't know about that. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1480.5s)]
*  Donald Trump has been sending the American people mixed signals about whether or not [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1485.5s)]
*  he's serious about running for a third term. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1491.66s)]
*  And Cenk, you seem to have a theory about why that is, right? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1494.66s)]
*  I do. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1499.66s)]
*  So I think that he is constantly testing the limits of his power. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1500.66s)]
*  If you said to him, here's a button like your Diet Coke button. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1504.66s)]
*  And if you press it, you become dictator. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1508.66s)]
*  We are done with the Constitution, but you rule forever and you have as much money as [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1511.66s)]
*  you want. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1515.66s)]
*  Do you know how quickly he'd press that button? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1516.66s)]
*  I mean, even take out the money part, right? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1518.66s)]
*  He'll find it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1521.14s)]
*  I mean, if he's dictator, he can have whatever he wants, right? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1522.14s)]
*  So he's like, most American people think like, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1524.14s)]
*  Even if you don't, well, for the folks who don't like him now, they might finally be [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1529.14s)]
*  here at that point. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1535.5400000000002s)]
*  But I've been saying from day one, because he says it all the time. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1536.5400000000002s)]
*  He's always talking about all dictators are amazing. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1539.5400000000002s)]
*  They can kill anyone they like. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1542.5400000000002s)]
*  And when they enter the room, everyone has to applaud. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1543.5400000000002s)]
*  And I love their military parades. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1545.5400000000002s)]
*  And I don't want to leave when I lose. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1548.5400000000002s)]
*  I want a third term, etc. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1550.3s)]
*  He would press that button so quickly, right? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1551.3s)]
*  So, but now there's a twist to the story. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1554.3s)]
*  Why is there a twist? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1557.3s)]
*  Because my theory is he does turn around when he gets unpopular, really unpopular. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1560.3s)]
*  So let's see how it played out in this story. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1566.3s)]
*  Go ahead, Jordan. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1568.3s)]
*  So last Friday, the Trump organization started selling Trump 2028 merchandise. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1570.3s)]
*  Then today, the Atlantic published a long interview they conducted with Trump that covered [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1576.06s)]
*  an array of topics, including him potentially running in 2028. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1581.06s)]
*  Ashley Parker and Michael Shearer write, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1585.06s)]
*  We asked Trump about a rumor we'd heard that he had tasked his justice department with [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1588.06s)]
*  looking into the legality of his running again in 2028. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1593.06s)]
*  He said he hadn't, but then seemed to leave open the possibility. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1596.06s)]
*  That would be a big shattering, wouldn't it? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1601.06s)]
*  He mused laughing. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1604.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, maybe I'm just trying to shatter, he noted, twice that his supporters regularly [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1605.1399999999999s)]
*  shout for him to seek a third term, but concluded, it's not something that I'm looking to do. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1610.86s)]
*  And I think it would be a very hard thing to do. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1616.46s)]
*  But that's not exactly what he told Kristen Welker at NBC less than a month ago. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1619.78s)]
*  A lot of people want me to do it. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1625.4199999999998s)]
*  But I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1627.3799999999999s)]
*  It's very early in the administration. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1631.94s)]
*  Asked to clarify if he was serious about running again, Trump said, I'm not joking, but I'm [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1634.8600000000001s)]
*  not, it's far too early to think about it. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1641.14s)]
*  When asked whether he has been presented with plans that allow him to seek a third term, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1645.3s)]
*  Trump said, there are methods which you could do it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1650.3s)]
*  Welker asked about a possible scenario in which JD Vance would run for president and [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1654.66s)]
*  then pass the role to Trump, a tactic some of his allies have already started promoting. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1658.78s)]
*  Trump responded that that's one method, but there are others too. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1664.1s)]
*  So he could be joking, he could just be entertaining the fanfare. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1670.14s)]
*  But to me, Cenk, especially with the merch, it seems like they're at least considering [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1676.34s)]
*  it. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1681.14s)]
*  They're exploring a way in which they might be able to try it. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1682.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's what he always does. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1687.5s)]
*  He does these test trials. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1690.06s)]
*  Now what if I don't listen to the courts? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1691.8999999999999s)]
*  Let's see how that one pulls. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1694.1799999999998s)]
*  Let's see how people react to that. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1695.9399999999998s)]
*  In the beginning, pretty good, pretty good. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1699.1399999999999s)]
*  Rogan says he likes due process. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1701.06s)]
*  Okay, let's see if we rethink that one. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1703.2199999999998s)]
*  Let's see how things go. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1705.82s)]
*  And on this one, part of what they do, guys, is they'll say it and they'll say, as Trump [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1707.5s)]
*  has said, that he wasn't joking, right? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1715.02s)]
*  Because in the beginning when you're testing it, you don't want to say you're joking, otherwise [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1718.34s)]
*  it ruins the test. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1722.6999999999998s)]
*  So he says, yes, I'm thinking of running for a third term. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1724.24s)]
*  There's a lot of ways to do it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1726.4199999999998s)]
*  No, I'm not joking. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1727.74s)]
*  And if it had come back with a lot of MAGA and a lot of independence and good polling, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1729.34s)]
*  coming back and going, yeah, boy, we hate the Constitution too, let's go burn it together. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1734.4599999999998s)]
*  If that had been the reaction, he'd have kept going and going and going until he ran for [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1740.78s)]
*  a third term and an 18th term, right? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1744.06s)]
*  But instead, what he got back was, what are you, stupid? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1747.3s)]
*  No, and even from Republicans. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1751.4199999999998s)]
*  The polling shows, we covered it a little bit earlier in the show, but when they were [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1753.7s)]
*  asked about this, of course, Democrats are dead set against it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1756.82s)]
*  Independence hated it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1761.62s)]
*  And even Republicans are like, no, no, just do your job, right? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1763.7s)]
*  So not all, but a good number of Republicans were in that category. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1769.32s)]
*  So it didn't play well. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1773.1s)]
*  And we'll show you some of the numbers in a second. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1774.1s)]
*  And then so now that his polling is dropping and it's not working, now he's back to, yeah, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1776.52s)]
*  I was just joking, I was just joking. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1780.62s)]
*  And that allows every MAGA guy to say every time he tries to do something unconstitutional, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1782.6599999999999s)]
*  he's just trolling, man, he's just trolling. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1786.4599999999998s)]
*  And by the way, is that what we want out of a president? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1789.1s)]
*  Someone who's constantly trolling like an idiot? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1791.58s)]
*  Like a literal, I was gonna say like a troll online, but that's literally what he is. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1794.1799999999998s)]
*  And he's the President of the United States and the Commander in Chief. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1800.94s)]
*  Jesus Christ, man, grow up. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1804.38s)]
*  If you're in the opposition and you're 13 years old or 21 years old and you're having [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1806.3400000000001s)]
*  fun trolling, woohoo, yeah, I trolled them, I trained. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1811.66s)]
*  Okay, or you're Ken Klippenstein and you're just having fun, no problem. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1814.54s)]
*  But you're the President of the United States and you're still trolling about setting the [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1817.82s)]
*  Constitution on fire? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1822.78s)]
*  How is that fun? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1825.26s)]
*  So all right, I mean, this is exactly what we were worried about. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1827.48s)]
*  The guy who said he'd terminate the Constitution after he lost, here he is trying to terminate [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1831.32s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1835.76s)]
*  But when he gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar, I was just kidding, I was just [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1836.96s)]
*  kidding, man. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1840.64s)]
*  Yeah, sure you were, buddy. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1841.64s)]
*  Now I wanna remind people, if you could remember this, in March of 2024, Brett, Erlich, Mark [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1845.08s)]
*  Thompson and I were on a power panel on March 29th. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1852.16s)]
*  And we covered an op-ed that a Project 2025 partner wrote about how Trump could seek a [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1856.08s)]
*  third term. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1864.48s)]
*  And I remember the conversation back then, people just dismissed it. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1865.6799999999998s)]
*  No, he won't do that, he can't do that. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1869.24s)]
*  Just passed a year later and they're looking at it, they're evaluating it, they're selling [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1874.1999999999998s)]
*  merch over it. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1877.6s)]
*  So again, we're going back to hey, Project 2025 and people in that orbit were telegraphing [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1879.36s)]
*  everything they wanted to do. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1886.28s)]
*  And much of that had to do with undoing the Constitution. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1888.4799999999998s)]
*  And here we are, their argument then was the 22nd Amendment only applied to consecutive [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1891.9199999999998s)]
*  terms. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1896.12s)]
*  So they said Trump was entitled to two consecutive terms. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1897.12s)]
*  The first one, for some reason, didn't count. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1901.2199999999998s)]
*  And of course, we know that's ludicrous and this would be patently unconstitutional under [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1904.7199999999998s)]
*  today's standards because of the 22nd Amendment. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1909.2s)]
*  But they don't seem to care because it's all about power for them. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1912.4s)]
*  All of their rhetoric about constitutional principles or going back to the origins of [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1916.1200000000001s)]
*  the founders, notwithstanding that this came later because of FDR, none of that really [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1921.68s)]
*  matters or holds weight. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1927.38s)]
*  It's just a inconvenient burden or obstacle in the way of some sort of objective that [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1928.88s)]
*  the right wants. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1934.28s)]
*  And you're seeing it play out here. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1935.28s)]
*  My only thing that makes me think he might not want to run is just that he's exhausted. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1937.12s)]
*  It's a tiring job. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1943.28s)]
*  He just wants to go off into the sunset, golf, relax, but still maintain some sense of importance [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1944.6799999999998s)]
*  and fanfare. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1951.2399999999998s)]
*  He likes the attention, he likes the cameras. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1952.8s)]
*  So if there was some sort of arrangement where he could be kind of like a president and have [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1955.36s)]
*  the president aesthetic while not having to do any of the responsibility, that I think [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1960.0s)]
*  would be the ideal solution for him. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1966.24s)]
*  But the only thing I think preventing him, Cenk, from a third term or seeking a third [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1967.56s)]
*  term would just be the workload that accompanies it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1971.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's a hilarious Fox News article about this where they say, this is just six [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1976.2s)]
*  days ago, they're like, yeah, polling for him running for a third term does not poll [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1982.92s)]
*  well very, very badly. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1988.6000000000001s)]
*  But it's such a bad number, they don't even state it in the article. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1991.0s)]
*  What they do at the end of the article go, okay, fine, even 53% of Republicans think [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1994.56s)]
*  bad idea, don't do that. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=1998.9199999999998s)]
*  So now he sees the polling and he goes back there, he's just joking, woohoo, the president's [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2000.9199999999998s)]
*  a clown, woohoo. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2007.08s)]
*  Okay, all right, I'll take it. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2009.12s)]
*  I'm glad he's going back and I hope he shuts up about it and instead of burning the Constitution, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2010.96s)]
*  they burn those stupid Trump 2028 hats and we move on with our lives. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2016.48s)]
*  But by the way, guys, that's a huge thing, right? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2020.56s)]
*  What are we most worried about is that they mess around with elections, they mess around [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2024.08s)]
*  with the Constitution. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2027.9199999999998s)]
*  So the fact that he's walking it back now that it's deeply unpopular is a good thing. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2029.3s)]
*  The fact that he ever proposed it is maniacally bad, right? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2034.3999999999999s)]
*  But at least he's responding to the polling, including among a majority of Republicans [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2039.3999999999999s)]
*  and thank God he's walking it back. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2044.48s)]
*  On Friday, there were three American citizen children born here who were deported along [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2054.08s)]
*  with their mothers from Louisiana down to Honduras. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2072.44s)]
*  And according to advocates, one of them is a four-year-old child with stage four cancer. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2075.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't report you as citizens. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2081.2799999999997s)]
*  The mother was deported along with the children. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2082.32s)]
*  The children aren't deported. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2084.92s)]
*  The mother chose to take the children with her. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2088.0400000000004s)]
*  When you're out of the country illegally and you know you're here illegally and you choose [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2089.8s)]
*  to have your assistant child, that's on you. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2093.4s)]
*  That's not on this administration. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2095.6800000000003s)]
*  If you choose to put your family in that position, that's on them. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2097.3s)]
*  The Trump administration is defending their decision to deport three children with US [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2102.96s)]
*  citizenship to Honduras with their mothers, including one child with cancer. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2107.8s)]
*  The children are from two different families who are living in Louisiana. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2113.36s)]
*  Both families were detained earlier last week during routine check-ins with ICE in New Orleans. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2117.28s)]
*  They were in the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, a probationary program that allows [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2122.6400000000003s)]
*  people undergoing immigration proceedings to stay in the country. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2128.44s)]
*  But both the women had reportedly missed one of these check-ins previously, so judges filed [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2132.96s)]
*  deportation orders. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2139.8s)]
*  On the day they were detained, ICE agents were waiting for them to arrive at their appointment. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2141.52s)]
*  Lawyers said the families were taken to Alexandria, Louisiana, three hours from New Orleans, where [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2146.8s)]
*  they weren't permitted to communicate with legal representatives. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2152.6s)]
*  The lawyers weren't able to reach their mothers until after they arrived in Honduras. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2156.36s)]
*  The mother of the two-year-old is pregnant, and the four-year-old, a boy, has a rare form [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2163.56s)]
*  of late-stage cancer, the family's lawyers said. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2169.32s)]
*  They said the boy had no access to his medications or his doctors while he was in custody with [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2172.6000000000004s)]
*  his seven-year-old sister and mother. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2177.96s)]
*  The administration is defending sending these kids to Honduras, claiming the moms requested [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2181.36s)]
*  the children stay with them. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2186.68s)]
*  But lawyers for both families dispute that, saying the moms weren't given an option to [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2188.64s)]
*  leave their children in the United States. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2193.56s)]
*  Lawyers representing the father of the two-year-old US citizen who was deported, identified as [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2196.56s)]
*  a VML in court documents, filed an emergency petition in the Western District of Louisiana [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2201.3999999999996s)]
*  on Thursday seeking her release. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2207.3199999999997s)]
*  But the child was put on a plane to Honduras the next morning before the court even opened. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2210.7799999999997s)]
*  Hours after the deportation, US District Judge Terry A. Doughty, a Trump appointee, issued [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2217.2s)]
*  an order expressing his concern that the girl had been deported against her father's wishes [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2224.12s)]
*  while stressing it is illegal and unconstitutional to deport US citizens. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2229.96s)]
*  Doughty set a May 16 court hearing to investigate his, quote, strong suspicion that the government [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2236.3999999999996s)]
*  just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process, end quote. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2242.88s)]
*  According to Gracie Willis, one of the lawyers representing the families, another attorney's [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2248.48s)]
*  effort to keep the four-year-old with cancer in the states were also ignored. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2253.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2258.8s)]
*  That attorney filed what's called an administrative stay of removal, which is a request for ICE [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2260.8s)]
*  to just temporarily halt any deportation in the interest of something happening. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2266.6800000000003s)]
*  And in this case, the lawyer requested the opportunity to file paperwork, complicated [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2272.6s)]
*  paperwork with the court to provide immigration options to the mother and especially to allow [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2277.7599999999998s)]
*  this four-year-old to continue treatment. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2283.56s)]
*  The attorney filed paperwork with ICE explaining what this child's medical situation was, explaining [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2286.0s)]
*  the diagnosis and didn't receive any kind of a response until the family was already [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2291.4s)]
*  on a plane on Friday morning. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2296.7799999999997s)]
*  Nonetheless, Marco Rubio, like Tom Homan, is denying any wrongdoing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2300.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  On the headline, that's a misleading headline. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2306.7599999999998s)]
*  Three US citizens ages four, seven and two were not deported. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2309.7599999999998s)]
*  Their mothers who were illegally in this country were deported. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2313.9599999999996s)]
*  The children went with their mothers. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2316.3199999999997s)]
*  Those children are US citizens. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2318.2799999999997s)]
*  They can come back into the United States if there's their father or someone here who [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2320.0s)]
*  wants to assume them. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2323.48s)]
*  But ultimately, who was deported was their mother, their mothers who were here illegally. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2324.7599999999998s)]
*  The children just went with their mothers. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2328.84s)]
*  But it wasn't like you guys make it sound like ICE agents kick down the door and grab [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2330.96s)]
*  the two-year-old and threw him on an airplane. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2334.6400000000003s)]
*  That's misleading. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2336.84s)]
*  That's just not true. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2337.84s)]
*  But again, the families and their lawyers dispute the fact that the moms wanted the [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2338.84s)]
*  children to go with them. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2347.06s)]
*  And they were sent out of the country before the court had a chance to intervene. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2349.1200000000003s)]
*  Cenk, what do you make of this story? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2354.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's two different things here. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2356.4s)]
*  Number one, the content of the story. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2358.52s)]
*  So the Trump administration now puts out statements so absurd. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2362.44s)]
*  They're in the ballpark of Baghdad Bob, the official Saddam Hussein spokesperson who would [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2368.4s)]
*  talk about how there were no Americans in Iraq as American tanks were literally rolling [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2374.72s)]
*  behind them on camera, right? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2379.68s)]
*  Maybe approaching the absurdity of IDF statements. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2383.44s)]
*  IDF, yes, 12 children were killed today in Gaza? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2387.2799999999997s)]
*  No, they were all 87-year-old Hamas leaders. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2394.48s)]
*  Okay, whatever, man. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2398.96s)]
*  So now, yes, we have a handwritten note from one of the moms in Spanish. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2400.56s)]
*  Maybe we don't. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2405.7999999999997s)]
*  The other mom we don't have anything on. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2408.04s)]
*  But trust us, she wanted to take her four-year-old who has cancer that is metastasized to Honduras [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2409.8s)]
*  instead of continuing to get treatment in America. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2417.7200000000003s)]
*  No, we don't trust you. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2420.1600000000003s)]
*  And that's not what the family says. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2421.96s)]
*  The family is saying, please bring them back. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2423.84s)]
*  They didn't even take the medication with them because they didn't know they were going [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2426.84s)]
*  to get hijacked and kidnapped. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2430.0s)]
*  They were US citizens. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2432.04s)]
*  We didn't know that a bunch of thugs were going to come and take them away without their [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2434.0s)]
*  Cancer medication. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2438.62s)]
*  So look, man, there's no end to the excuses for people who are in favor of this stuff. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2440.86s)]
*  So but guys, the second point is more important. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2447.54s)]
*  The second point is about due process. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2452.1s)]
*  So I know some on the right will say, hey, listen, I believe Marco Rubio. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2454.7799999999997s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2460.2599999999998s)]
*  I believe Donald Trump. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2461.2599999999998s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2462.2599999999998s)]
*  And Holman and all those guys. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2463.2599999999998s)]
*  And the moms are undocumented and there is a court order. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2464.2599999999998s)]
*  And if she wanted to take the kids, I understand your point on that. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2468.0s)]
*  But do you understand what US District Judge Doughty is saying? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2471.08s)]
*  We didn't go through any procedure here. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2474.96s)]
*  You tell me, the family is telling me that you deported these American citizens. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2477.84s)]
*  You're saying no, they left voluntarily. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2483.32s)]
*  But I never had a hearing. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2485.84s)]
*  They never had a hearing. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2488.12s)]
*  So I have no idea who's telling the truth. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2489.68s)]
*  That's why we do hearings. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2491.94s)]
*  That's why we have courts. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2494.2400000000002s)]
*  That's why we do due process. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2496.04s)]
*  And we don't just take your word for it. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2497.36s)]
*  I mean, Trump's already talked about potentially deporting US citizens to El Salvador. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2501.16s)]
*  Again, in his mad ramblings, presumably in the same way that he's doing now without any [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2507.2799999999997s)]
*  due process. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2513.16s)]
*  So what else can you do to a US citizen without due process? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2514.8s)]
*  And then tell us later, yeah, it's okay. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2519.52s)]
*  Can you murder a US citizen without asking a judge? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2522.44s)]
*  Just go, no, trust me, trust me. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2525.24s)]
*  Yeah, the family wanted it. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2527.44s)]
*  I took a 27-year-old down to Guatemala and I slit his throat. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2528.92s)]
*  But it's okay, it's okay. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2534.4s)]
*  He wanted his throat slit or he was MS-28 or whatever he was. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2535.68s)]
*  It's okay, I gave you some BS talking point. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2539.36s)]
*  Trust me, trust the Israeli government. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2541.96s)]
*  Trust Baghdad Bob. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2545.3199999999997s)]
*  It's okay, no, that's not how our system works. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2546.3199999999997s)]
*  This is America. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2550.2799999999997s)]
*  We have a constitution. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2551.72s)]
*  We have due process. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2553.2799999999997s)]
*  Those are the cornerstones of Western civilization and we don't give those away because there's [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2554.88s)]
*  a madman in office who wants to look like he's tough on immigrants. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2560.96s)]
*  And you think, Jack, you're getting carried away. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2565.2400000000002s)]
*  Now what kind of absurd hypothetical is this? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2567.36s)]
*  You bring a 28-year-old down and slit their throat in Guatemala. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2569.52s)]
*  The four-year-old in Honduras doesn't have their cancer medication and it's metastasized. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2573.56s)]
*  We've been trying to get back, all sane people in America have been trying to, which is not [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2581.1600000000003s)]
*  over 70% of Americans want them back. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2584.84s)]
*  Abrego Garcia, the Trump administration has admitted that it was an error and they won't [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2587.76s)]
*  bring him back. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2593.48s)]
*  So how long is it going to take to bring back the four-year-old US citizen who's a cancer [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2594.6400000000003s)]
*  patient and has no medication down there? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2600.2200000000003s)]
*  And what if they die? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2602.92s)]
*  What if they die? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2604.56s)]
*  All right, is MAGA still going to be flipping about it? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2605.56s)]
*  Like, yeah, so what, man? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2608.6400000000003s)]
*  That four-year-old died. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2610.04s)]
*  By the way, I'm pro-life. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2611.4s)]
*  And by the way, I love the Constitution, except the Constitution. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2613.4s)]
*  I hate it and I don't think we should follow it. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2616.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think we should burn the courts down and the Constitution down. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2618.8s)]
*  If this is what you think is making America great again, I got bad news for you. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2621.92s)]
*  The rest of America doesn't agree. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2628.44s)]
*  It is absurd, it's overreach, it's crazy, it's un-American. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2630.4s)]
*  I just want to point out why they were deported. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2633.88s)]
*  And this was allegedly that they missed a meeting and then they were transferred three [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2642.08s)]
*  hours away and weren't permitted to meet with their lawyers. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2646.12s)]
*  Now that part specifically, I want to zero in on because that is not new. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2651.4s)]
*  That happened under Obama. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2656.76s)]
*  There were facilities, family detention facilities, which are really just prisons for families [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2659.22s)]
*  who are seeking refuge here as they waited their credible fear interviews as part of [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2665.4199999999996s)]
*  the asylum process. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2670.14s)]
*  And as they were held in these facilities in like, Karns County in Texas, along the [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2671.7799999999997s)]
*  border, Obama's officials also would not let lawyers meet with these people. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2676.2999999999997s)]
*  So we need to, of course, express outrage over this happening now, but we also need [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2683.14s)]
*  to hold Democratic administrations to the exact same standard. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2688.66s)]
*  And like Cenk is talking about, we need to think about how we want this country to operate, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2693.22s)]
*  what we want this country to be, and what we think represents the best of us. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2698.5s)]
*  And to me, I think many people watching this, it is an inclusive society where we extend [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2703.7s)]
*  rights and liberties to everyone, regardless of documentation or status. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2709.2599999999998s)]
*  That's fair, that's equitable, and that's just. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2716.14s)]
*  But that also means holding Democratic leaders to account when they're in office and it comes [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2719.1s)]
*  time to extend due process rights to undocumented people under a Democratic administration. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2724.1s)]
*  And unfortunately, under the Obama administration, that wasn't happening. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2730.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to add one quick thing to that. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2734.14s)]
*  So this is why we piss off people on both sides. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2736.22s)]
*  They want rah-rah cheerleaders for one side or the other. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2738.58s)]
*  Sorry, we're not going to do that. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2741.66s)]
*  We're going to tell you the truth. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2742.66s)]
*  Barack Obama not only did what Jordan's talking about and deported more people than any other [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2744.06s)]
*  president, but you want to talk about due process. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2748.86s)]
*  He killed an American citizen without asking any courts. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2752.22s)]
*  And then his ridiculous attorney, General Eric Holder, said that due process is not [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2755.2599999999998s)]
*  necessarily a judicial process. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2759.98s)]
*  That's just absurd, totally, utterly absurd. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2762.02s)]
*  And we're not calling that out now, we called it out then. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2764.9s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2768.06s)]
*  It wasn't just other Democrats. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2769.06s)]
*  This is why mainstream media has massive, massive problems. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2771.18s)]
*  This is why the country hates the establishment so much that they voted for Trump. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2775.54s)]
*  Because mainstream media, when Trump does it, okay, they're on it, good, that's a good [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2780.5s)]
*  thing, they should be on it, we're on it, right? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2783.94s)]
*  When Obama does it, they're like, what? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2785.94s)]
*  A very US citizen, due process, what name so? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2787.7799999999997s)]
*  Deported 2 million people without doing it the right way, what name so? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2791.5s)]
*  No, it's beloved Democratic leadership, beloved corporate politicians. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2795.58s)]
*  They've taken some sort of oath to never, ever criticize them. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2800.42s)]
*  So I'm sick of it. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2803.82s)]
*  Do real reporting, do real journalism, hold all sides accountable. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2806.82s)]
*  If you're in media, you're not supposed to kiss up to the powerful, you're supposed to [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2811.7400000000002s)]
*  challenge the powerful. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2815.2200000000003s)]
*  I know it's a new concept for them. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2816.86s)]
*  Both sides should check it out, and most importantly, journalists should check it out. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2818.98s)]
*  Bring those kids back right away. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2822.7000000000003s)]
*  US citizens, if their family wants them back, bring them back. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2824.7000000000003s)]
*  And most importantly, you've got to follow due process. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2828.54s)]
*  If you don't do that, then as Trump would say ironically, then we don't have a country. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2833.3s)]
*  If we don't have due process, we have a dictatorship and it ain't America, okay? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2838.82s)]
*  You must check with the courts. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2843.2599999999998s)]
*  That's how it's supposed to work, no matter whether you're a Republican or Democrat. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2845.06s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break here. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2848.06s)]
*  When we come back, Jordan and I might debate. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2849.62s)]
*  Back on to you, I think, Jay and Jordan with you guys. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2871.94s)]
*  One more story for you, Jordan, go ahead. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2873.66s)]
*  Another Democrat in Congress is retiring, but this time it resurfaces a recent fight [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2877.5s)]
*  between establishment Democrats and progressives. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2883.34s)]
*  Virginia Democrat Jerry Connolly announced today that he will not seek reelection due [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2886.78s)]
*  to his cancer diagnosis. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2892.32s)]
*  When I announced my diagnosis six months ago, I promised transparency. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2894.76s)]
*  After grueling treatments, we've learned that the cancer, while initially beaten back, has [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2899.22s)]
*  now returned. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2904.18s)]
*  I'll do everything possible to continue to represent you and thank you for your grace. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2905.66s)]
*  He also added that he'll be stepping down from a prominent committee post. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2910.98s)]
*  The sun is setting on my time in public service, and this will be my last term in Congress. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2915.8199999999997s)]
*  I will be stepping back as ranking member of the oversight committee soon with no rancor [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2921.4s)]
*  and a full heart. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2926.74s)]
*  I move into this final chapter full of pride and what we've accomplished together over [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2928.22s)]
*  30 years. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2932.14s)]
*  My loving family and staff sustain me, my extended family, you all have been a joy to [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2933.2999999999997s)]
*  serve. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2938.7s)]
*  Some may remember that Connolly and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were both vying for [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2940.3399999999997s)]
*  the position of ranking member on oversight. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2946.94s)]
*  But House Democrats narrowly voted last December to give that position to Connolly. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2949.46s)]
*  That was befuddling to many progressives and even some Democrats who supported AOC for [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2955.46s)]
*  the position as oversight is a critical committee for keeping the administration in check. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2960.58s)]
*  And given that Connolly had just been diagnosed with esophageal cancer the month prior, many [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2966.82s)]
*  wondered if he was up to the task. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2971.74s)]
*  But let's look at what Connolly and his allies were saying when committee assignments were [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2974.38s)]
*  being deliberated. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2978.84s)]
*  Connolly's trademark vigor made colleagues comfortable that he could take on the Trump [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2981.34s)]
*  administration despite his age and recent cancer diagnosis, multiple lawmakers told [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2986.38s)]
*  Axios. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2992.1400000000003s)]
*  Said Connolly, we're looking at capability, we're not looking at age. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2993.5s)]
*  Is somebody capable irrespective of how old they are and if they bring energy and enthusiasm? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=2997.3s)]
*  And I think this one takes the case. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3004.1000000000004s)]
*  The cake representative Don Beyer of Virginia added, Jerry's a young 74, cancer notwithstanding. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3006.0600000000004s)]
*  Now, Cenk, I know you've got more you wanna get into after this, but on Connolly stepping [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3016.06s)]
*  down, I mean, 100 days in, I don't remember much from Connolly's time as House Oversight [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3020.22s)]
*  Chair, which makes you wonder, why did he need that position so bad to begin with? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3027.14s)]
*  Yeah, I don't remember much about Connolly's tenure as US Congressman, period. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3032.3s)]
*  To be fair to Connolly though, I don't remember much about 200 Democrats in Congress that [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3039.14s)]
*  just sit in a cave somewhere. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3047.18s)]
*  Every once in a while I'll hear about a new Democratic congressman, but really? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3049.2599999999998s)]
*  And I don't mean new as in they're new, I mean, I heard about it recently. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3054.58s)]
*  And they'll be like, yeah, that guy's from Philadelphia, he's been a congressman for [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3061.62s)]
*  28 years. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3064.8599999999997s)]
*  The reason why they never come out, whether we're gonna find out if it's spring or not, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3068.06s)]
*  right, is because they think, well, I got this comfortable position, I have status, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3075.1s)]
*  power, fame, whatever I have, right? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3081.42s)]
*  Well, not much fame since they never show themselves in public. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3083.42s)]
*  And so I'm just gonna sit here on my ass and do nothing. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3087.42s)]
*  So tell me what amazing things Connolly did in his career. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3090.18s)]
*  Anyway, so the reason I bring that up is not because I'm trying to hate on Connolly, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3093.78s)]
*  okay? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3098.5s)]
*  I wish him well with his treatment. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3099.5s)]
*  He was a Democrat, so you need those votes, etc. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3101.7400000000002s)]
*  But I'm tired of the establishment telling us how wonderful their 70, 80, 90 year old [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3105.5800000000004s)]
*  members are, how amazing they are. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3111.7000000000003s)]
*  What did you pass? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3114.5800000000004s)]
*  What did you guys all collectively pass that you're all so wonderful and that we just can't [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3116.36s)]
*  live without you? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3120.78s)]
*  We can't go to the new guard. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3121.78s)]
*  No way, cuz the old guard's been killing it, have they? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3123.5s)]
*  Have they? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3127.86s)]
*  And so to answer Jordan's question, why do they wanted to have him in that position? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3128.86s)]
*  And why did he easily win that vote? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3134.94s)]
*  Because most of the Democratic Congress people are super old. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3138.54s)]
*  And they waited like 20, 30 years to get these irrelevant positions that they were gonna [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3144.3s)]
*  do nothing with. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3148.38s)]
*  So they're like, wait a minute, I'm not gonna have these young whippersnappers just because [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3150.42s)]
*  they're effective and are aggressive and can actually fight back. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3154.5s)]
*  Do the job right. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3159.8s)]
*  No, I'm gonna do it, cuz I've been waiting 28 years for this. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3160.9s)]
*  And seniority is more important, and competency is the most important. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3165.7400000000002s)]
*  Protecting our status and privilege is the most important thing in the world. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3169.38s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3172.98s)]
*  I don't care about your status and privilege at all, at all. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3173.98s)]
*  So yeah, obviously AOC should have gotten that position in the first place. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3177.74s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder who's going to be a more charismatic speaker and effectively fight back AOC or [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3181.4599999999996s)]
*  Connolly, who you've literally never heard of before. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3188.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, AOC isn't even on that committee anymore. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3192.2999999999997s)]
*  She's on energy and commerce. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3197.5s)]
*  And while they have some role in evaluating and calling out what the administration does, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3198.5s)]
*  oversight is a very, very important committee. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3205.78s)]
*  Raskin shared that committee in the last term. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3208.06s)]
*  To me, it was always purely about keeping progressives at bay. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3213.06s)]
*  And many people on the left who are a bit more cynical on how you can work within the [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3217.38s)]
*  system have been pointing out, look, you're playing the game. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3222.42s)]
*  You tried to cheer on the Biden administration. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3225.98s)]
*  You tried to help propel Kamala Harris to victory. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3228.58s)]
*  You spoke at the DNC. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3231.86s)]
*  You were very flattering of the administration and their purported efforts for a ceasefire. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3234.02s)]
*  And this is how they treat you. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3242.62s)]
*  And I think to many people, they'll look at that and say, why should we even work with [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3244.62s)]
*  them? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3247.86s)]
*  Why should we even try to work within this system if this is how they're still going [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3248.86s)]
*  to treat us? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3251.54s)]
*  I don't think that they're entirely wrong in that criticism. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3253.18s)]
*  It fuels cynicism about how Democrats will treat progressives. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3256.42s)]
*  And I think it's going to take a lot of people trying to buck the system, trying to take [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3260.66s)]
*  it on head first, rather than try to work within it. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3264.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, my favorite part was the quote about Connolly's trademark vigor. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3267.62s)]
*  That was a trademark loss on me, brother. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3273.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay, really? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3277.46s)]
*  He has a trademark vigor. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3278.46s)]
*  That's why he's been breathing fire against Republicans and insisting on passing the most [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3281.3799999999997s)]
*  popular parts of the Democratic policy place. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3285.98s)]
*  All right, look, last thing on old guard versus new guard. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3288.98s)]
*  Recently, we talked about David Hogg starting a PAC, and he's now the DSC vice chair. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3292.1800000000003s)]
*  And so he wants to raise $20 million to run in blue seats against incumbents. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3299.34s)]
*  I'm 100% in favor of that. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3304.34s)]
*  I believe Jordan's 100% in favor of that. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3306.7000000000003s)]
*  But I did say on the show that I get it and it makes sense. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3309.38s)]
*  And Jordan's right. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3314.86s)]
*  The establishment has a terrible track record. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3315.86s)]
*  The DNC has a terrible track record of being, and that's what I talked about, the DNC's [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3318.46s)]
*  track record of being hypocritical on this issue. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3323.7400000000002s)]
*  The minute progressives do something, hey, we found a rule. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3326.26s)]
*  And when establishment guys and incumbents do something, golly gee, we just couldn't [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3329.5s)]
*  find a way to be fair, right? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3334.06s)]
*  But I think that Ken Martin at the DNC is trying to pass a rule that makes sense, which [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3336.42s)]
*  is the DNC officers should be neutral. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3341.9s)]
*  And so 99 out of 100 times, they're not neutral in the establishment direction. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3345.18s)]
*  In this case, it happens to be in the progressive direction. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3350.8999999999996s)]
*  And so I get it and Jordan will say how convenient and that's what I said earlier. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3355.58s)]
*  But I do like the rule, Jordan. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3359.54s)]
*  I think the DNC officers should be neutral. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3361.3799999999997s)]
*  And it's a potential moment for Marbury versus Madison type of moment where the Supreme Court [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3365.2599999999998s)]
*  ruled against their political interests but gave themselves the power to be able to adjudicate [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3372.9s)]
*  cases coming from the executive branch. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3378.34s)]
*  So in this case, if you're called the hog rule, and okay, David has to make a decision [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3380.42s)]
*  about at least taking himself off of the electoral part of the PAC and staying as DNC vice chair [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3384.7400000000002s)]
*  or just going full born to the PAC. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3392.1000000000004s)]
*  At least then we could apply that very, very clearly to every other DNC officer and make [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3395.02s)]
*  sure that they do not touch any PACs and rig any rules in favor of the establishment. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3400.5s)]
*  I mean, yeah, of course, it's how convenient I would like to see them do this in any other [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3406.5s)]
*  circumstance, right? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3413.78s)]
*  Until then, I'm just going to disregard it and just chalk it up to more business as usual. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3416.02s)]
*  Because what hog is doing is saying, hey, let's get new people in there. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3421.78s)]
*  Let's get rid of the old guard who is just preserving the status quo. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3425.34s)]
*  And let's get some people who actually want to go in and do work. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3429.14s)]
*  And the DNC is saying, no, we can't do that. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3431.7799999999997s)]
*  You gotta remain neutral. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3434.58s)]
*  We can't interfere with the poor, sweet old guard, the establishment Democrats. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3436.2599999999998s)]
*  If they were doing this and their roles were reversed, I'd be shocked. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3442.46s)]
*  But every single time that they put their thumb on the scales or issue some new rule [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3447.22s)]
*  or tut-tut somebody, it is to preserve the people who are already entrenched in power. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3453.7000000000003s)]
*  I'll remind people that after the Sanders campaign of 2016, they threatened to blacklist [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3458.98s)]
*  any vendors or consultants, any groups, any strategists who helped any sort of progressive [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3465.2200000000003s)]
*  challenger. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3473.3s)]
*  That was also specifically to try to thwart Justice Democrats' influence. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3474.3s)]
*  You had Josh Gottheimer, who worked with the Chamber of Commerce in business interests [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3479.22s)]
*  to undermine the key parts of Biden's legislative agenda, the Build Back Better Plan. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3484.02s)]
*  He was working with businesses to kill that. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3489.66s)]
*  He's teaming up with the Keem Jefferies for a PAC. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3492.98s)]
*  Team Blue PAC, he did this a couple years ago. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3496.22s)]
*  Ryan Grim has written about it. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3497.7799999999997s)]
*  Team Blue PAC to protect Democratic incumbents against progressive challengers. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3499.8199999999997s)]
*  They're fine with all of that. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3505.46s)]
*  I want to see them do some sort of throwing their weight around when it comes to anybody [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3506.78s)]
*  else. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3513.2200000000003s)]
*  Because all I have seen for years is them saying, no, it's fine. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3514.42s)]
*  We gotta protect the status quo. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3518.2200000000003s)]
*  We gotta protect the incumbent Democrats. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3519.7000000000003s)]
*  In every single ruling, every single issuance of guidance or anything, always comes at the [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3523.42s)]
*  expense of outside challengers. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3528.5s)]
*  So I refuse to give Ken Martin or the DNC any credit because I haven't seen this applied [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3530.62s)]
*  in any sort of fair way. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3538.02s)]
*  And maybe it will, but until then, I'm withholding judgment. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3540.02s)]
*  Okay, I have a proposal, see if we can get to a compromise. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3544.1s)]
*  So because, look, we agree on so much of this. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3547.7s)]
*  We both agree that the PAC is great. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3550.94s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with the PAC. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3552.5s)]
*  Definitely running against incumbents, right? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3554.14s)]
*  So number two, let me see if I can get an agreement on this. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3555.98s)]
*  We both agree that the DNC's past has been terrible. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3558.74s)]
*  They've been entirely biased. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3561.2999999999997s)]
*  Anyone claiming that they weren't biased is out of their minds, right? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3563.3399999999997s)]
*  Now, but on the other hand, Ken Martin has a track record of being very progressive in [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3567.58s)]
*  Minnesota and helped to pass a lot of progressive legislation, actually got things done, etc. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3572.06s)]
*  So I think it's a little unfair to put the entire DNC history on Ken Martin. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3579.3999999999996s)]
*  I also think Ken Martin has to understand that that DNC history exists. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3585.54s)]
*  Are we okay so far, Jordan? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3589.34s)]
*  Is that fair so far? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3590.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3593.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3594.9s)]
*  I think there's more to it than that, but I don't want to see if there's anything else. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3595.5800000000004s)]
*  Okay, so now the compromise is, why don't we do both at the same time? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3598.1000000000004s)]
*  All right, and I'll offer one of two things. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3603.9s)]
*  Look, when you talk about the terrible things that DNC did in the past, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3605.7400000000002s)]
*  it's a giant list, right? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3609.6600000000003s)]
*  Debbie Wasserman Schultz had money flowing from donors to the state parties to Hillary [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3611.02s)]
*  Clinton, but not to Bernie Sanders. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3617.38s)]
*  That level of cheating was 10,000 times worse than what Hague is proposing here. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3621.06s)]
*  Would they have actually ousted her? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3626.78s)]
*  No way, and they didn't, of course, and they covered it up. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3628.34s)]
*  Have they condemned it since? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3632.34s)]
*  No, even though it was a massive case of cheating at the very highest levels, etc. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3633.62s)]
*  Now, and that's literally cheating, that was against the bylaws, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3639.22s)]
*  it was against everything, okay? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3642.66s)]
*  So now there are two things, but that's gone. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3644.8599999999997s)]
*  So there are two things that we could do. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3646.8599999999997s)]
*  Okay, all right, I get the need for neutrality for the DNC officers, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3648.3399999999997s)]
*  and I'm now apparently calling it the Hague rule. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3653.7799999999997s)]
*  So I like that, and I think Ken Martin is right about that. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3656.5s)]
*  Okay, then does it also apply to Democratic leaders? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3659.1s)]
*  Because if we're talking about leadership of the Democratic Party, so [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3663.8599999999997s)]
*  does Hakeem Jeffries have to stop his PAC, which is aimed at protecting incumbents and [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3667.02s)]
*  against primary challengers who are very often progressives and populists? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3673.98s)]
*  So this is not a deal that, I mean, I don't know if you'd accept a deal, Jordan, but [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3679.42s)]
*  I'm curious whether the DNC will accept a deal. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3683.78s)]
*  Or are we going to have two different sets of rules, one for progressives and [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3686.38s)]
*  one for the beloved establishment, Hakeem Jeffries and the rest? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3689.94s)]
*  Okay, if you don't like that one, how about this one? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3694.02s)]
*  Jordan talked about the blacklist, right? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3696.3s)]
*  So how about the blacklist? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3699.82s)]
*  Did anyone ever even take away the blacklist? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3702.82s)]
*  Did they ever bring those people back? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3705.42s)]
*  Did they ever lift it? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3707.1000000000004s)]
*  Does that garbage still exist? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3708.9s)]
*  I mean, at least like a clarification on it, right? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3710.86s)]
*  And did anyone get blacklisted for [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3714.0600000000004s)]
*  working on a campaign against Jamal Bowman or Cory Bush? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3716.9s)]
*  Can we go back and blacklist them? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3720.1000000000004s)]
*  Because I thought we had a blacklist against incumbents. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3723.1000000000004s)]
*  So what I'm looking for is consistency. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3725.7s)]
*  And I'm okay with consistency applied to progressives, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3728.8199999999997s)]
*  including David Hahn. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3731.9399999999996s)]
*  But it's got to be applied to the other side as well. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3733.62s)]
*  So if the Democratic Party now says no, I'm going to continue blacklisting [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3736.98s)]
*  progressive, anyone who helps a progressive primary challenger. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3740.7s)]
*  And I'm not going to blacklist the vendors that help the incumbents. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3744.62s)]
*  I mean, help conservative Democrats, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3750.06s)]
*  corporate Democrats run against incumbent progressives. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3752.38s)]
*  And no, Hakeem Jeffries and Godheimer, Godheimer's not a leader, but [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3756.54s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries and others, they can run any PAC they like, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3760.42s)]
*  only progressives like Hodgkin. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3763.94s)]
*  Then okay, then you're not being consistent. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3766.1800000000003s)]
*  So what do you think of the proposal to do them at the same time, George? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3770.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but again, it's all hypothetical. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3775.58s)]
*  If they were to do that, of course, yeah, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3778.06s)]
*  I guess be a step in the right direction. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3780.94s)]
*  But the one thing for me is that makes me less optimistic that it would be ever [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3783.1800000000003s)]
*  applied in an equitable and fair and all inclusive way. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3788.78s)]
*  Is that the DNC is a machine and they ultimately operate at the behest of [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3794.26s)]
*  their big donors, special interests, corporations. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3799.02s)]
*  They rely on funding in part from those entities. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3802.1s)]
*  And those people don't want progressives to win, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3806.5s)]
*  those donors don't want progressives to win, but they need that money. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3808.86s)]
*  So I don't think they're ever going to be in a position where they could [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3812.86s)]
*  operate in that way. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3818.3s)]
*  You saw major corporate donors at the DNC convention. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3820.46s)]
*  You see groups like Democratic majority for Israel, very present and [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3825.1000000000004s)]
*  have a robust presence at the DNC, distributing booklets, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3830.06s)]
*  promoting Kamala Harris's support for Israel at the DNC. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3834.38s)]
*  They're not dismissing or pushing those people out of their circle. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3839.42s)]
*  They're not keeping them at arm's length or admonishing them. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3845.1000000000004s)]
*  These people are especially Democratic majority for [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3850.42s)]
*  Israel spending millions on races to unseat progressives. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3852.86s)]
*  How many, many millions spent unseating Cori Bush like you talked about? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3857.2200000000003s)]
*  They don't care, they're fine with that. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3862.9s)]
*  As long as it helps preserve corporate Democrats and their power. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3865.3s)]
*  So while Ken Martin may have good intentions, while he could have been [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3869.02s)]
*  a good, like you say, he was a good progressive in Minnesota. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3874.1400000000003s)]
*  He is now part of machine and he's a figurehead for [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3878.94s)]
*  a machine that is ultimately adversarial to progressive interests. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3881.5800000000004s)]
*  Has been, there are good progressives that support Bernie, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3887.6200000000003s)]
*  that support Ken Martin and this rule. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3892.34s)]
*  But the DNC has been that institution. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3895.2200000000003s)]
*  I think they need to acknowledge that and [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3897.3s)]
*  they need to give an olive branch back, right? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3898.7400000000002s)]
*  If they, okay, I mean, I know they'll never ever do this, right? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3901.9s)]
*  But okay, Democratic majority for Israel, APAC and [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3905.82s)]
*  all the other Israeli lobbies and if there's any other foreign lobbies that [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3911.1400000000003s)]
*  worked against incumbents like Bowman and Bush. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3915.98s)]
*  If they're banned and they're blacklisted like progressive organizations were, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3920.02s)]
*  okay, now that's an olive branch and now we could have a deal. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3924.7400000000002s)]
*  Now we all know they're never ever ever going to do that because they love [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3928.46s)]
*  that kind of PAC money. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3932.98s)]
*  So you can't have it both ways, that's the thing we all agree on, right? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3934.7s)]
*  So I like the neutrality rule, but if they're going to do that, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3939.14s)]
*  I think the most reasonable compromises than Hakeem Jeffries and [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3943.9s)]
*  any other Democratic leader in the House also has to divorce themselves from [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3948.54s)]
*  their PACs. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3953.46s)]
*  Because what you want, unilateral disarmament on one side, but not the other, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3954.58s)]
*  that doesn't seem to make sense to me. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3959.18s)]
*  So let's have even rules that are neutrally applied. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3961.7s)]
*  So I like the neutrality rule, but [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3964.86s)]
*  the neutrality rule should be in the context of actually being neutral. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3966.98s)]
*  That's my proposal. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3971.86s)]
*  Okay, and my guess is they'll say there's nothing we could do about [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3974.7799999999997s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, there's nothing we could do about a PAC or [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3977.22s)]
*  Democratic majority for Israel. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3980.06s)]
*  There's nothing we could do about blacklists, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3981.94s)]
*  there's nothing we could do about anything. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3983.74s)]
*  But to be fair, I haven't checked on what their latest thing is, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3985.54s)]
*  what the blacklists are and whether people got taken off the blacklist. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3988.22s)]
*  So, but look, my point is I'm principled. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3991.2599999999998s)]
*  Neutrality is the right rule and we should apply it equally to both sides. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=3995.8999999999996s)]
*  We see equality, then it's a different question and a different book. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=4000.5s)]
*  All right, we gotta go. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=4005.06s)]
*  We're way over Jordan, you're awesome. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=4006.42s)]
*  Everybody check him out at Rebel HQ and you're near golf course. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=4008.42s)]
*  Nearby golf course. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=4011.58s)]
*  Okay, all right, much love. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=4012.7000000000003s)]
*  When we come back, Sharon's going to join us and [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=4015.02s)]
*  Bernie Sanders calling out a fellow Democrat, finally. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=4017.9s)]
*  All right, Bernie, we'll be right back. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIijVLWsHs&t=4022.7400000000002s)]
