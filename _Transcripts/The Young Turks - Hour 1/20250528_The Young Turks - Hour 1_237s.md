"Social media was taken aback on Tuesday as many discovered for the first time about an annual competition where people risk life and limb for a wheel of cheese thrown down a steep hill.
The annual cheese rolling event takes place every year in Gloucestershire, England and attracts thousands. The competition centers on a wheel of Double Gloucester cheese being thrown down the steep Cooper‚Äôs Hill. Those competing then throw themselves down the hill and the first person to the bottom ‚Äî or to catch the cheese ‚Äî wins. The quirky tradition dates back to 1826."

# WTF Is THIS?!?!
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI)
*  A wheel of cheese, a steep hill and broken bones. Winners have officially been crowned in this year's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=0.0s)]
*  cheese rolling race, the most famous and important cheese rolling race in the world. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=6.72s)]
*  It's also a people rolling race. This is a centuries old tradition in Gloucester, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=12.16s)]
*  England. No wonder they lost the empire. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=15.92s)]
*  What you just witnessed on your screen with dozens of people rolling down a hill and injuring [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=20.88s)]
*  themselves is real. But more shockingly, it's not in the United States. It's in a different country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=26.96s)]
*  And you know what? I'll allow it. I love it when people in other countries do things that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=35.52s)]
*  give Americans a little bit of a pass, because we do a lot of embarrassing things. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=42.8s)]
*  Sometimes I don't feel so good about how we come across on the international stage. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=46.32s)]
*  But this is such a fun story, right? Who doesn't want to break their bones for a wheel of cheese? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=50.72s)]
*  Now, what you witnessed is the so-called cheese roll. It's unclear how old this tradition in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=56.8s)]
*  England is, but apparently it is a tradition. And the winner gets a big reward. So I'll tell [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  you what that is in just a minute. But if you thought that was crazy, just wait until you hear [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=71.36s)]
*  what the winners of the cheese roll had to say for themselves. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=75.44s)]
*  The wheel of double-glossed cheese. And you can see they kind of get injured often in the process. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=86.8s)]
*  A German man won for the second year in a row. He said, quote, I worked for this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=92.8s)]
*  I risked my life for this. It's my cheese. All right, in the women's category, a woman from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=96.96s)]
*  London won. And she told the BBC after the race, she doesn't even like cheese. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=104.08s)]
*  I don't know what to say to that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=111.44s)]
*  That's the most shocking bit of the whole story. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=112.16s)]
*  Cheese can go 80 miles an hour. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=114.56s)]
*  Listen, if you like to get roughed up, just say you like to get roughed up. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=119.76s)]
*  Okay, you don't have to pretend like you're in this tradition, you're into it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=123.44s)]
*  I like that this woman is like, I don't even like the cheese. I just want to get roughed up. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=127.92s)]
*  I want to harm myself. Anyway, the winner gets a huge prize. It's literally just the wheel of cheese. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=131.04s)]
*  And then they're crowned the winner, but that's it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=139.68s)]
*  I don't really understand it, but the man who won this year is a YouTuber by the name of Tom [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=141.6s)]
*  Koppke. Here's more of what he had to say after his win. He says last year, the hill was muddy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  And this year, it was dry and dangerous and people got injured. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=155.12s)]
*  Wow, the cheese roll used to be an official tradition, but it was canceled in 2010, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  likely because people realized not all traditions are good. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=167.92s)]
*  And maybe this is a bad idea if people are getting injured. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=172.4s)]
*  But local authorities now state the event, well, it's too dangerous. Clearly, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=175.36s)]
*  they decided to hold it again. So this year's event prompted a safety warning from the local [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=180.08s)]
*  ambulance police and fire services who warned they could be overwhelmed if there was a mass [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=186.64s)]
*  casualty incident. So there was some concern that people might die from literally rolling [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=193.36s)]
*  down a steep hill in order to capture and win a wheel of cheese. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=199.36s)]
*  But the cheese rollers have kept this tradition going clearly, and two of this year's contestants [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  had to be taken to the hospital. So regardless of the bad decisions you've made in your life, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  when you feel like being too hard on yourself, I want you to think about these ladies and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=215.12s)]
*  gentlemen who decided to roll down a steep hill and injure themselves all in the name of cheese. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=218.88s)]
*  That's it. That's all they got. And one of them didn't even like cheese to begin with. Incredible. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVm4VE51uAI&t=225.44s)]
