TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Pro-Israel Group Is Coming For YouTuber Ms. Rachel
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE)
*  I saw a picture of two babies in Gaza and their thighs are like this small. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=0.0s)]
*  You can't let children starve. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=6.88s)]
*  That is not who we are. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't say love every neighbor except there are so many reasons I stand strong in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=11.72s)]
*  love. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=16.76s)]
*  Stand with everyone. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=17.76s)]
*  That's who I am. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=18.76s)]
*  The woman that you just heard from unfortunately has become the latest target of a pro-Israel [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=19.76s)]
*  group that has encouraged the Trump administration to investigate her for possibly being a foreign [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=35.72s)]
*  agent. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=43.56s)]
*  Now why would they do that? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Well apparently she is drawing attention to the atrocities committed by the Israeli government [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=46.32s)]
*  against the Palestinian people, namely the children of Gaza. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=50.72s)]
*  And this organization wants to intimidate her and prevent her from doing so. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=56.32s)]
*  So let's get into the details on what's going on here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=60.92s)]
*  So this pro-Israel group is known as stop antisemitism.org. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=62.96s)]
*  And they sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi to urge her to investigate this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=68.72s)]
*  YouTuber. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=74.4s)]
*  She creates YouTube videos for children. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=75.4s)]
*  None of her YouTube videos delve into the current war on Gaza at all. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  However, she's got her own social media accounts as well. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  And on Instagram, she draws attention to what is happening to the children of Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  Clearly, I mean as someone who creates content for kids, she's someone who cares about the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=91.44s)]
*  well-being of children and what's happening on the ground in Gaza is absolutely breaking [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  her heart. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=100.2s)]
*  So this story was first reported by the New York Post. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=101.64s)]
*  And I encourage you all to read the New York Post piece on this because they shared their [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  examples of her saying things that stop antisemitism.org takes issue with. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=110.96s)]
*  And let's actually fast forward to those graphics because here are some examples shared by the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  New York Post. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if they're sharing this as justification for what stop antisemitism is doing, but here's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  one example. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=126.8s)]
*  Let's go back to this photo where she says this is a prayer for children in Gaza. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=127.8s)]
*  That was shared by the New York Post. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=133.8s)]
*  Okay, so is there something wrong with her saying that? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=135.16s)]
*  Okay, let's go to the other photo. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=137.48s)]
*  Please stop hurting them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=139.8s)]
*  Wow, offensive, super offensive. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=141.64s)]
*  Now let's get back to stop antisemitism.org. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  They claim, look, we value freedom of speech. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=148.0s)]
*  Don't get us wrong. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  We totally value freedom of speech. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  It's just that she's sharing misinformation about what's happening to children in Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=154.3s)]
*  I don't believe that it's misinformation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  I'll explain why in just a minute. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=163.94s)]
*  But they believe maybe there's some likelihood that she's getting funded by foreign actors [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  to propagate this misinformation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=171.3s)]
*  So Pam Bondi, we want you to investigate it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=173.74s)]
*  So we have some excerpts from their letter to the DOJ, and I wanna get into it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=176.86s)]
*  So the content creator is known as Miss Rachel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=183.02s)]
*  Her real name is Rachel Griffin Accurso. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=185.76s)]
*  And apparently she has frequently posted about the living conditions in Gaza for children [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=190.04s)]
*  to her 2.5 million Instagram followers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=196.4s)]
*  Unlike her YouTube content, her Instagram posts are more geared toward adults. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=201.28s)]
*  She has highlighted the destruction in Gaza since Hamas's war with Israel began in 2023. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=206.76s)]
*  And has called for better conditions and humanitarian aid for the children. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=213.56s)]
*  Now that's an excerpt from a Hill piece. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=218.6s)]
*  Believe me, I didn't miss that ridiculous framing about how this is Hamas's war on Israel. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=220.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=225.8s)]
*  What Hamas did on October 7th was absolutely disgusting. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=226.68s)]
*  Got no love for Hamas. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=229.76s)]
*  I have no interest in defending Hamas at all. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=231.08s)]
*  But really you're gonna frame it as, this is a war on Israel when Hamas ain't got no [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=234.36s)]
*  military. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=238.76s)]
*  They have no defense capabilities. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=240.12s)]
*  Israel is backed by the top military superpower, the United States. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=242.68s)]
*  They have the Iron Dome. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=247.84s)]
*  Their defense capacity capabilities are incredible. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=249.08s)]
*  Really we're gonna, okay, so I got that framing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=254.96s)]
*  Now fast forward to Laura Rez, who's the director of stop antisemitism.org. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=256.48s)]
*  She feels aggrieved, aggrieved that this incredibly popular content creator would dare [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  to draw attention to the plight of Palestinian children. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  So she writes this letter to Pam Bondi and the DOJ saying, given the vast sums of foreign [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=271.56s)]
*  funds that have been directed toward propagandizing our young people on college campuses, we suspect [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=277.0s)]
*  there is a similar dynamic in the online influencer space. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=285.56s)]
*  Right, okay. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=289.76s)]
*  So the highly popular children's content creator who has been viewed 10 billion times is really [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=291.92s)]
*  hard upon cash and needs to reach out to foreign actors for money and is propagating false [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  narratives about what's happening in Gaza as a result. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=311.16s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  In other words, she thinks that this highly popular person is taking money from what Iran, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  Hamas, or could it be that she has two eyes, two ears and is able to see what's happening [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=321.4s)]
*  based on the videos coming from Gaza? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=327.08s)]
*  They further write, we urge you and your office, meaning the DOJ, to investigate whether or [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=333.32s)]
*  not Ms. Rachel is being remunerated to disseminate Hamas aligned propaganda to her millions of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  followers as this may violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=345.28s)]
*  I actually think stop antisemitism.org should be investigated to see if there's any foreign [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=349.08000000000004s)]
*  money flowing into their coffers. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=353.44s)]
*  I just suspect it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=355.92s)]
*  That's it, I just suspect. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  I just suspect that this organization is getting funded by Israel or other foreign countries [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=360.44s)]
*  who are sympathetic to Israel. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=366.36s)]
*  That's all it takes, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=367.36s)]
*  Just suspicion. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=370.76s)]
*  Now, do they have any evidence, any real indication that this content creator has taken money [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=371.76s)]
*  from a foreign government or foreign players in order to spread misinformation about Gaza [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=378.84s)]
*  and what Israel's doing? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=384.2s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=385.64s)]
*  Make no mistake about what they're doing here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=387.28s)]
*  They're just trying to shut her up. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=388.96s)]
*  They're just trying to intimidate her. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=390.88s)]
*  I looked through her content. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=394.12s)]
*  I didn't see a single example of her spreading antisemitism. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  I've seen examples of her feeling absolutely heartbroken over what's happening to children [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=399.64s)]
*  on the ground in Gaza. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=406.88s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=410.0s)]
*  There's this notion by Israel and by pro-Israel groups that very well might be funded by Israel. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=412.44s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=419.32s)]
*  But that if you just censor any type of criticism over what the Israeli government's doing right [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=420.32s)]
*  now, people are not gonna know about it, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=427.44s)]
*  We're just not gonna find out. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=432.0s)]
*  We all know, we all see it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=434.36s)]
*  What they're doing right now in trying to intimidate people who are speaking out against [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=436.8s)]
*  what the IDF is doing, how Israel is prosecuting this war, is they are actually expanding [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=441.44s)]
*  antisemitism, not just in this country, but around the world. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  When you're trying to silence Americans because you don't like their speech about [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  how a foreign country is behaving, that unfortunately leads to more antisemitism. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=458.88s)]
*  But they're hell bent on that because they can't handle even a little bit of criticism [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=464.8s)]
*  against precious Israel, even as they are openly talking about starving people to death, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=469.36s)]
*  as they're openly discussing ethnic cleansing on land that belongs to the Palestinian people. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=475.92s)]
*  I mean, maybe stop antisemitism.org needs to have a talk with members of the far right Israeli [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=483.2s)]
*  government because they're the ones propagating antisemitism all across the world as we speak. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=489.68s)]
*  Talking about dropping nukes on Gaza, come on. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=496.8s)]
*  We urge you and your office to investigate whether or not Ms. Rachel is being [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=501.68s)]
*  basically paid, okay, to spread this content. Her posts have largely ignored the suffering of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=506.32s)]
*  Israeli victims, hostages and Jewish children, while she consistently amplifies misinformation [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=513.04s)]
*  from Hamas and other anti-Israel sources. Well, it's interesting because the Hill actually looked [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=519.92s)]
*  into the allegation that Ms. Rachel didn't show a shred of sympathy for the children who were [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=526.0s)]
*  victimized by the atrocities carried out by Hamas. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=533.36s)]
*  And wow, would you look at that? Apparently, she has previously posted about that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=536.16s)]
*  She cares for all children, Palestinian and Israeli. She defended her actions [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=542.0s)]
*  and fundraising efforts for kids in Gaza. So again, the Hill looked at it, they're like, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=546.96s)]
*  no, she has previously posted about what happened to those Israeli kids. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=553.36s)]
*  Now in the letter to Bondi, the group said that Ms. Rachel has been incorporating Hamas-like [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=557.52s)]
*  propaganda or Hamas-like propagated images and stories into her content. And by Hamas-like [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=564.4s)]
*  content, this is what they're talking about, okay? So they're talking about a video or a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  photo that she shared of a child that was suffering from starvation. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=576.64s)]
*  And so the group argues that it's misinformation. They claim that the child wasn't suffering from [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=583.92s)]
*  starvation, even though Israel has openly said multiple times that they're doing blockades of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=590.56s)]
*  humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The group claims, no, he is suffering from cystic fibrosis, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  not from starvation. The child's mother, by the way, has said that her child is suffering from both, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=604.8s)]
*  which again is totally feasible considering the fact that Israel has said publicly on the record [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=611.52s)]
*  that they're blocking humanitarian aid from the beginning of this war. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=618.24s)]
*  They've bombed every hospital. They've bombed every refugee camp. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=624.4s)]
*  They have bombed residential buildings. The President of the United States, Donald Trump, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=629.6s)]
*  just this week talked about how unlivable the Gaza Strip is. By the way, partly thanks to the United [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=634.8s)]
*  States supplying Israel with the bombs that they're dropping on said children. But really, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=640.96s)]
*  they're gonna try to pretend like there haven't been atrocities committed by the IDF [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=644.8s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. The IDF killed three hostages themselves that we know of. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=649.76s)]
*  There's likely more considering the aerial bombardments that aren't just gonna victimize [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=657.68s)]
*  the people in Gaza, the Palestinian people in Gaza, but also of the hostages who are being held [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=662.88s)]
*  captive in the Gaza Strip. This is just insane. Now, and if the organization is worried about the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=669.44s)]
*  spread of misinformation, they do have a very funny way of putting it or showing it, I should say. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=676.0s)]
*  Because in a tweet that they recently posted, they accused Ms. Rachel of promoting a starving [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  child from Gaza photo, which was actually a cystic fibrosis case. That's what I had already [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=689.44s)]
*  talked about. But Hamas' false stat of 14,000 plus kids killed, they claim that 72% of deaths [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=694.72s)]
*  are combat-aged men. That's just not true. It's just not true. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=703.0400000000001s)]
*  And if they wanna hide the fact that Israel has slaughtered all those innocent children in [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=710.32s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, and by the way, they just killed a 14-year-old boy in the West Bank, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=717.52s)]
*  who was also an American citizen, by the way. If they wanna hide that reality from the public, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=724.72s)]
*  understand what that means. That is an admission that the IDF is carrying out atrocities. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=733.2s)]
*  Okay, they don't want anyone to know about these things because it makes Israel look really bad. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=740.32s)]
*  And guess what? The current Israeli government, which I separate, I see as distinct from the [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=746.1600000000001s)]
*  people, the civilians of Israel, is evil. What they are doing is ethnic cleansing in Gaza at best [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=753.52s)]
*  and a genocide at worst. So that is the reality. We all see what's happening on the ground. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=765.84s)]
*  And while they're doing everything they can to intimidate anyone who dares to speak the truth [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  about what's happening on the ground, they're not going to win this PR nightmare for pro-Israel [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=780.8s)]
*  interest groups. Because when you see video after video after video of a mother wailing [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  on top of their child who is dead as a result of these aerial bombardments. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=796.7199999999999s)]
*  When you see a father holding his decapitated baby as a result of what the IDF is doing in the Gaza [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=801.92s)]
*  Strip, there's no level of intimidation from a disgusting group like this that's going to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=808.56s)]
*  shut people like me up, that's for sure. We all see what's happening. I am the child, okay? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=814.88s)]
*  I am the product of ancestors who suffered a genocide. And I'll be damned if a group like this [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=822.16s)]
*  is going to shut someone like me up about what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=831.52s)]
*  not just in the Gaza Strip, but also the West Bank. I hope Ms. Rachel stays strong. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=836.16s)]
*  I hope she understands this is just an attempt to intimidate her and nothing more. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=840.64s)]
*  And shame on the Trump administration for in various examples that we've talked about on this [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=846.48s)]
*  show, going along with these intimidation tactics on behalf of a foreign country. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=852.48s)]
*  Is it America and Americans first or is it Israel first? Because so far what we've seen from the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=859.92s)]
*  Trump administration is Israel comes first, America might come second. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=865.12s)]
*  Are you going to be a puppet for a foreign government or are you going to serve your people [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=871.52s)]
*  and protect them from these intimidation tactics? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=877.12s)]
*  I think we all know what the answer is and it grosses me out beyond words. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW9IeMCi7eE&t=879.92s)]
