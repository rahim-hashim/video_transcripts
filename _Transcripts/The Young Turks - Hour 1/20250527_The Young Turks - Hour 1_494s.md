"Emmanuel Macron has denied he and his wife, Brigitte, had an altercation after a viral video promoted by Russian state media and French far-right accounts appeared to show her pushing him in the face as they prepared to get off a plane in Vietnam.
The video, shot by an Associated Press camera operator, shows the French president appearing in the doorway of the plane at the start of a visit to Hanoi. His wife‚Äôs hand appears to shove him, causing him to step back before recovering and waving."

# What In The WORLD Happened Between Emmanuel Macron And His Wife?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg)
*  French President Emmanuel Macron was making some news over the weekend, likely for reasons that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=0.0s)]
*  he did not want. But nonetheless, there was some footage of his wife slapping him around [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=7.36s)]
*  as he was on a plane. Now, he's downplaying it, but it's caught a lot of attention. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=14.16s)]
*  Now, we can't show you the video for copyright reasons, but we have some still frames showing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=20.16s)]
*  two hands that kind of emerge and hit him in the face. And it turns out that the hands belong to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=24.959999999999997s)]
*  his wife. And you know it's his wife because she then disembarked the plane with him moments later [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=32.4s)]
*  wearing a bright red suit jacket. Now, according to The Guardian, while that video was shot [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=39.6s)]
*  by an Associated Press camera operator, the video was promoted heavily by Russian state media and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  French conservatives. So we shouldn't talk about this because it's being promoted by [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=52.88s)]
*  Russian shank. We should just avoid the story altogether. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=57.52s)]
*  Yeah, so I watched the video for I know, everyone thinks we shouldn't talk about a story that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  doesn't make them look good. I got it, right? So, but I watched the video, Anna, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=68.72s)]
*  I wouldn't call it a slap. It was more like this and- [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=76.0s)]
*  That's better, that's better. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=80.72s)]
*  Yeah, I know, it's not necessarily better at all. You're gonna give my crows excuse, right? But [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=81.92s)]
*  after the excuse, I wanna talk about what was that? Because I don't think it was a slap and I [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=89.44s)]
*  don't think it was friendly, but I don't know what the hell it was. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=96.4s)]
*  Yes, I can't wait to get to the point where we speculate about what happened because [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=101.28s)]
*  there could be a sexy reason for it too. But hold, we'll get to that in just a moment. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=105.28s)]
*  First, according to The Guardian, while the video was shot by the Associated Press, as I mentioned, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=110.08s)]
*  they're claiming that Russian state media is running with this story, French conservatives [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=114.96s)]
*  are, and that is true, but what was on video was on video, so you could all see it for yourselves. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=119.76s)]
*  Now, Brigitte Macron's body is not visible and her husband told reporters afterwards, the gesture [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  was playful. But the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson seized on the footage writing on [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=131.6s)]
*  telegram that the president had received a right hook. Okay, it wasn't a right hook, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=137.44s)]
*  let's all calm down for a second, but I'm not buying that it was playful. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=143.04s)]
*  Did the first lady decide to cheer up her husband with a gentle pat on the cheek and miscalculated [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=148.32s)]
*  her strength? She asked in a mocking post, did she want to fix his collar but ended up reaching [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=153.76s)]
*  the beloved face, she added, after the Russia Today TV channel and Associated [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=160.96s)]
*  social media accounts had repeatedly aired the clip. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=167.68s)]
*  Here's a hint, maybe it was the hand of the Kremlin. Now, others are stating that there's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=170.72s)]
*  a power imbalance between the two because of their age. She is much older than him [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  and it is a little bit uncomfortable. I believe she used to be his school teacher and that's how [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  they met. We can weigh in on that in just a moment. But first, let's speculate about the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=187.52s)]
*  hands on the face situation. It didn't look playful. It looked like she was upset with him. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=192.08s)]
*  It looked like she was just, and then all of a sudden he realizes, my God, the plane's door is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=197.28s)]
*  open, cameras are pointed at us and they can see us. So he just kind of got himself together right [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  away, they exited the plane and then the story just kind of blew up from there. I mean, look, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=209.44s)]
*  they're a married couple. Married couples like to wrestle sometimes. Sometimes they have conflict. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=214.8s)]
*  You shouldn't use hands, you really shouldn't. So I'm not in any way condoning that. But [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=219.52s)]
*  it looked like a married couple having a real moment and it was caught on camera and now [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=226.0s)]
*  everyone's talking about it. That's my take. Yeah, I've decided that I don't like anybody [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=231.36s)]
*  in this story. A power imbalance, she has a power imbalance over him. He's the president of France. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=235.52s)]
*  I don't know what power imbalance. So like, is that because she's older, she gets to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=244.56s)]
*  hit him? No, that's not a thing. I don't even know what people are talking about. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=252.16s)]
*  Anyways, if you watch the video, it's not like she does this to him and he's like, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=256.64s)]
*  he's like, he looks upset like this. Then he realizes he's on camera and he's like this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=262.8s)]
*  And then he starts walking. So he didn't look all together then, please. So [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=268.48s)]
*  if it's something sexual and playful, I mean double around because they take that stuff, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=272.56s)]
*  role playing pretty seriously then, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=280.0s)]
*  And I wouldn't really do that right before you're gonna get off a plane [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=283.76s)]
*  on an official visit to Vietnam, right? So that seems less likely. And it seems like they were [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=287.44s)]
*  fighting. She did that. I don't know if it happens a lot or that was the only time. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=293.36s)]
*  So I don't believe anyone. I don't believe that it was playful. And I don't believe that it's some [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=298.32s)]
*  sort of, I don't know, abuse that happens all the time and something to do with Russia. I don't know [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  what it has to do with Russia. Yeah, yeah, I agree with you. I think there were probably [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=310.56s)]
*  quarreling about something and she decided to use hands, which she shouldn't do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  But going back to the power imbalance allegations, Cenk, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=322.64s)]
*  she must think that there's a power imbalance if she feels comfortable hitting them in the face, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  kind of in public. I mean, yes, they were on a plane, but I'm sure there are other people on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=331.52s)]
*  that plane. Really, you feel that comfortable slapping your husband around in a public place? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  That's not a good sign. I hear you on all that, but she didn't slap him. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=341.28s)]
*  We have no idea what happened. It was like this. So was she trying to smear something off his face, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=348.0s)]
*  but then got super awkward because she wasn't looking? Or was she like, get out of here? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=353.52s)]
*  We don't know. We don't know. And by the way, I mean, why do we even care? So [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=359.84s)]
*  is it going to affect French foreign policy? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=366.79999999999995s)]
*  No, we care because it's hot gossip, okay? That's why we care. We care because the news has all [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  sorts of awful things in it and everyone needs a break to speculate about some powerful person's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=374.64s)]
*  marriage and that's exactly what we're doing now, okay? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=380.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. That's all it is. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=383.76s)]
*  As long as we're clear about it. Right. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=384.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=387.2s)]
*  I mean, but Macron has gone through a couple of things recently. There's the fake cocaine, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=387.68s)]
*  there's the bad handshake. What is all that stuff in it? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  Okay, so let's just quickly address the cocaine allegations, which was ridiculous. So earlier [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  this month, wow, Alex Jones, of all people, who would have expected that? Shared a video of Macron [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=401.44s)]
*  apparently using cocaine with the German Chancellor and the British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=408.4s)]
*  Because that's totally what world leaders do. They get together, they snort the cocaine, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  they talk about world dominance, whatever. Here's some video, take a look. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=420.56s)]
*  That's raw, bro. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=425.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=426.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=427.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=428.24s)]
*  It's literally. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=428.88000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=429.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=430.16s)]
*  We came through Germany. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=430.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  And then we made it to France. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  And then we got through the border. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=434.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=436.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  The photo and that's the tattoo, yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=437.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=438.8s)]
*  We'd deal with it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=439.44000000000005s)]
*  The ring. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so toward the end of that video, you see Macron take some tissue paper and kind of hide it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=445.6s)]
*  I guess that was supposed to be the cocaine. It looked like he was just moving tissue [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtiqkwv9ryg&t=452.16s)]
