# Trump's MANIACAL Trade War Gets GLOWING Reviews On Fox News
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18)
*  Trump announced a brilliant move to pause the higher tariffs on countries negotiating with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=0.0s)]
*  But meanwhile, to raise China's tariffs to 125%. So wall off China by boxing them out, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=6.4s)]
*  further weakening their economic power. It's genius. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=15.84s)]
*  All right, well, as you all know by now, Trump announced yesterday that his tariffs [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=19.52s)]
*  were not going into effect except for the ones against China. And very predictably, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=26.64s)]
*  the hosts over on Fox News and other Trump fans are spinning this move. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=31.84s)]
*  Not as market manipulation, not as insider trading, not as an irresponsible level of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=36.72s)]
*  disregard for the global markets, but as a genius move. That's a quote, genius move on Trump's part. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Cenk, this is truly the art of the deal, isn't it? Trump puts out the fire that he started and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=49.36s)]
*  Fox News is overjoyed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=54.64s)]
*  Yeah, so we're gonna show you some more clips of people who are absolutely asinine, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=57.12s)]
*  pretending that Trump meant all of this. Come on is what I have to say about that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=62.72s)]
*  We've got a poll on it in the live chat, of course, shows live at six o'clock Eastern every day. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=68.88s)]
*  And but in a little bit, I'm gonna talk about why it's exceedingly obvious that he didn't mean it, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=73.28s)]
*  including some of the important details that prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=80.64s)]
*  All right, well, according to Fox News, this was the plan all along. I can't wait to hear you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=84.0s)]
*  rebut that, Cenk. But at least that's what they're saying now after nearly melting down [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=91.2s)]
*  over the past few days. And with these tariffs, many people who voted for Trump never believed [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  he would actually go through with them, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=101.36s)]
*  That was the thing that they always said, that the threat of these tariffs were the actual move. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=103.12s)]
*  Trump was just negotiating with world leaders through very abusive and volatile means, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=107.84s)]
*  which is, I guess, the way he does things. This was after Trump spent a week also, up until the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=112.64s)]
*  very last moment when he finally reversed the tariffs, telling everyone that he definitely [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  was not going to change his mind on them. Of course, many of us did suspect that something [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=123.2s)]
*  like this would happen, that we maybe had different ideas as to why something like this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=128.16s)]
*  was going to happen. So here is Sean Hannity patting himself on the back for calling it all [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=132.72s)]
*  along. But again, not because he was privy to any kind of market manipulation or insider trading [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=137.6s)]
*  or anything like that, because he knows the art of the deal when he sees it. Take a look. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=143.44s)]
*  The art of the deal told you this was gonna happen. It was inevitable. Donald [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=147.84s)]
*  Trump's in a perpetual state of negotiation, a huge win for the president, a huge win for the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=153.6s)]
*  country, his biggest accomplishment of the second term, and there have been many. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=158.48s)]
*  Take a look at all the progress from this president just over the last few months at office. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  And now once again, the haters, the doubters, the legacy media mob, the chicken littles, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=168.64s)]
*  the Democrats, all the people on the left wing, they were all proven wrong, screaming and yelling [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=174.16s)]
*  and ranting and raving. They all, as usual, end up with egg on their face exactly one week [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=178.96s)]
*  after Liberation Day. The stock market closed with its third biggest overall gain since World War II. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  S&P up nearly 10%, the Dow Jones up nearly 8%, with the biggest point increase in American history [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=191.36s)]
*  in a single day. The NASDAQ, well, that jumped by more than 12%. Markets rallied after President [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=198.24s)]
*  Trump announced an immediate 90 day pause on his stated reciprocal tariffs. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=204.56s)]
*  Are we the ones with egg on our faces? I can't tell if we're the ones that he's referring to. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=209.68s)]
*  But Cenk, I am curious what you think here. Even though the markets have rebounded, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=216.88s)]
*  they aren't better than where they were before Trump did any of this. So [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=222.0s)]
*  do you think there's an argument somewhere that what Trump gained politically is maybe [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=225.52s)]
*  worth what we lost in the markets? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=230.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's no argument at all. At all, not 1%. So let's break it down. So first off, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=231.6s)]
*  this idea that, hey, we're the third biggest day of stock market rise ever. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=241.68s)]
*  Congratulations, Donald Trump. Yeah, that's because he created the markets by 12%, which is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=248.72s)]
*  it's a shocking number. So then he regained some of that when he reversed his clownish tariffs. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=256.0s)]
*  You don't get to brag, well, I just got the third largest day of pulling a car out of the ditch. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=264.4s)]
*  Who drove it into the ditch? I mean, I did. I drove it way into the ditch. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=271.28s)]
*  Now I haven't gotten it out really, it's halfway out. But I had one of my biggest days of taking [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=274.64s)]
*  a car out of a ditch. I mean, really, really, if you're on the right, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=279.2s)]
*  can anyone really believe that? I mean, you saw the markets plummet and then you saw them rise [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=285.68s)]
*  back up, but not to their previous level. And you're gonna give Trump credit for that? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  Who else caused the market crash? This is a literal question. Is there anyone not in a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=299.2s)]
*  mental institution who thought that something other than Donald Trump's mega tariffs [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=304.8s)]
*  caused the stock market crash? So if he got halfway out of it by reversing his clownish moves, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=311.36s)]
*  are you really gonna give him credit for that? Come on. And then let's continue with the come ons. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=318.48s)]
*  Laura Ingraham, genius. Wait, wait, how do I get to be genius? Well, here, I give away $100, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=324.8s)]
*  get $50 back, I lost $50. Genius, I'm such a genius. Okay, wait a minute. To be fair, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=331.2s)]
*  let's talk about what we got in return because there's a lot of pain in the market. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=338.32s)]
*  And by the way, guess what? The markets went back down today, another 1,100 points. Why? Because of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=342.08s)]
*  the maniacal tariffs that remain on China that are at 145%. We'll get to that later in the show. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=347.2s)]
*  So but to be fair, what did we get in return? Because they said 70 countries are in negotiations [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  with us. South Korea and Japan might make a deal any minute. They're all panicking. They're all [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=358.64s)]
*  coming to us. The European Union might bring it down their tariffs down to zero. We got this, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=362.8s)]
*  we got this. In return for reversing his tariff policy, Donald Trump got exactly [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=366.8s)]
*  zero concessions. None, none, none. A panic retreat. By the way, he should have panicked. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  It's about the bond markets. And come back to that. And that was huge because just stock market [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=380.64s)]
*  crashing was one thing. When the stock market and the bond markets were crashing at the same time, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=386.8s)]
*  which was previously thought unimaginable, undoable, because usually when the stock market [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=391.92s)]
*  goes down, the bonds go up and vice versa. In this case, Donald Trump did something miraculous. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=397.12s)]
*  He managed to crash both of them at the same time. I'm not sure anyone's ever pulled that off before. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=403.44s)]
*  Genius. The art of the deal. My favorite though was Sean Hannity talking about, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=409.92s)]
*  told you. Hey Sean, you told us that these tariffs are gonna last forever and it was [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=414.72s)]
*  gonna rebuild our manufacturing base. Now they're gone and you're saying told you? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=421.04s)]
*  So what is happening to our manufacturing base? Wait, were they short-term negotiation ploy [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=427.6s)]
*  or were they long-term to build a manufacturing base? So well, obviously it couldn't be long-term [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  to build a manufacturing base. They're gone, they're gone. Is the manufacturing base going [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=438.32000000000005s)]
*  to magically be rebuilt by four days of tariffs that were then withdrawn? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=442.88s)]
*  Okay, who could be maniacal enough to believe that? And then, well, no, to be fair, look, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=448.64s)]
*  maybe some of you, and by the way, some of the people did. They didn't like the long-term plan [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=456.08s)]
*  or they didn't believe in the long-term plan, but there were people who thought, no, he's just [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=460.24s)]
*  negotiating, it's art of the deal, etc. But when you negotiate and you get literally nothing back [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=463.36s)]
*  and you flip flop like a panic clown, well, then it was a short-term gain either. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  So it was no gain at all, cuz I got news for you what I've been telling you for a decade straight. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=475.36s)]
*  The one thing that people just cannot get through their heads about Donald Trump, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  maniacally stupid, has no idea what he's doing and never has, is one talent marketing. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=485.44000000000005s)]
*  Me, me, me, me, me, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=493.04s)]
*  on the list, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=495.2s)]
*  and that by the way, and you've heard me say this a billion times. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=496.96s)]
*  The fact that that one talent, which to me is like, just the bare minimum, bare minimum, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=500.64s)]
*  has destroyed the Democratic Party. That shows you how pathetic the Democratic Party is. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=508.4s)]
*  Okay, but back to Trump, if we got no tariffs reduced in return, and we have rebuilt absolutely [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  nothing in our industries, how could it possibly have been a grand strategy? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=522.56s)]
*  Unless the grand strategy was to shave off all this money from the stock market and risk a [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=526.88s)]
*  recession for absolutely no gain. And if that was the strategy, well, then you have to admit [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  that's the worst strategy in the history of the world. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I think what you were saying about the stock and bond markets, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  really just remarkable, just a remarkable failure on Trump's part. When the bond markets dropped, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=545.04s)]
*  recession wasn't even a consideration anymore. We were about to plunder ourselves into a [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=550.56s)]
*  depression. And allegedly, reportedly, Trump was worried about a depression all of a sudden. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  He said, this is really bad. Let me pull back again for an entire week saying, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  nothing is going to change my mind. Everyone be cool, everybody relax. I know what I'm doing, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=565.5999999999999s)]
*  right? That's what he told us. And that's kind of been his line for as long as we've known him as [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  a presidential candidate and as a president. He keeps telling his supporters that he is the only [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=575.6s)]
*  one who can fix all of their problems. And so just let him cook, just to just sit back and let him do [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  what he's got to do. And they do, they really put a lot of faith in him. And we'll get to more on [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=586.64s)]
*  how disastrous this actually is. But of course, everybody over on Fox is not really thrilled [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  about this 90-day tariff pause, nor do they think it was a brilliant or genius move. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=598.96s)]
*  Some people are naysaying a little bit over on Fox, take a look. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=604.0s)]
*  But let's be clear what happened. Who capitulated here and why? And I don't wanna say this because [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=607.36s)]
*  I'm a patriot, I'm an American. But it is the White House who capitulated based on everything [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=616.88s)]
*  I hear and all my sources. And the reason why is because of the bond market and what happened [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=623.28s)]
*  last night. Besson knows this better than anybody. When you have yields on the 10-year rising to 5%, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=628.48s)]
*  stuff starts shutting down when you have the lending markets screwed up. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=637.04s)]
*  By the way, who was dumping the bonds? Somebody asked him if it was China, right? It wasn't, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=640.72s)]
*  it was Japan. While he was negotiating with Japan, Japan, according to my sources, were running major [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=646.72s)]
*  money management firms that are involved in the bond market without giving up names. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=653.84s)]
*  Japan was dumping bonds because they believe this was not a great place to do business. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=658.64s)]
*  What a strange statement, by the way, that he doesn't want to admit that Trump was wrong [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=663.44s)]
*  because he's a patriot. Patriotism isn't supposed to make you stupid. Sometimes it does, I guess, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=670.48s)]
*  but it makes you just stop thinking. But you can be a patriot and still criticize your government. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  In fact, I think it makes you more of a patriot if you are willing to criticize your government, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=680.32s)]
*  especially in a democratic government. But according to Trump, here is the real reason [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=684.6400000000001s)]
*  why he reversed course at the last minute. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=690.32s)]
*  Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  you know? They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid, unlike these champions. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=700.88s)]
*  Because we have a big job to do. No other president would have done what I did. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  I know the president, they wouldn't have done it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=710.24s)]
*  So the reason was that people are getting yippy. And so he was like, don't like that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=712.0s)]
*  However, according to the New York Times, it was more than just this yippiness that ultimately [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=720.32s)]
*  swayed the president away from his tariff plan. According to the New York Times, they said, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=725.9200000000001s)]
*  behind the scenes, senior members of Mr. Trump's team had feared a financial panic [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=730.48s)]
*  that could spiral out of control and potentially devastate the economy. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=736.0799999999999s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Bissette and others on the president's team, including Vice President [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=740.16s)]
*  J.D. Vance, had been pushing for a more structured approach to the trade conflict [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=745.76s)]
*  that would focus on isolating China as the worst actor while still sending a broader [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=750.56s)]
*  message that Mr. Trump was serious about cracking down on trade imbalances. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=755.36s)]
*  Okay, Cenk, Trump fans seems to believe that because something needs work, it needs to be [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=760.88s)]
*  completely just burned to the ground and rebuilt by, I guess, incompetent people. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=766.0s)]
*  I'm usually not bad about a burn it all down strategy, just speaking generally in life, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=771.36s)]
*  which I admit is very volatile. But when you're dealing with global markets, right? When you're [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=776.0s)]
*  dealing with people's money and their livelihoods, when you're dealing with government, you're [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=780.32s)]
*  supposed to be a little bit more responsible than what we've seen demonstrated by this [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=784.64s)]
*  administration so far. Maybe when you're running your own business, you can be as reckless as you [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=788.32s)]
*  wanna be. But I keep saying government is not a business and it's not supposed to be run like [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=792.6400000000001s)]
*  a business, right? The job of the government is to take care of the people it governs. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=798.1600000000001s)]
*  And right now Trump and his administration, they are not doing that. What do you think, Cenk? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=804.08s)]
*  Cenk R. Larkin Yeah, so first of all, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  I do agree with Trump on one thing. No other president would have done this. Well, that's true. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=810.08s)]
*  That's totally true. No other president would have put in global, maniacal, enormous tariffs, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=814.88s)]
*  crashed the markets, got nothing in return, and then in a panic, reversed himself. But to be fair, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  Sean Hannity said this is one of his biggest accomplishments, which in an ironic kind of way, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=828.16s)]
*  it might be true. Cuz the bar for Trump is so low, he's accomplished nearly nothing, other than [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=832.32s)]
*  giant corporate tax cuts in his first term. And while we're all looking at this, the House today [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=836.88s)]
*  passed $5 trillion in tax cuts. And that's going to be his second largest accomplishment. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=841.6s)]
*  He is the world's most ironic populist. Okay, so but if Hannity is right, and this was all a secret [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=846.96s)]
*  genius plan to get nothing but reverse yourself, but it was planned all along. Trump meant this. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=853.9200000000001s)]
*  That is why it is the art of the deal. And why do you say people got the yippies and panicked, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=862.08s)]
*  and that's why I had to reverse myself? If you planned it all along, didn't you know the yippie [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=866.88s)]
*  was coming? What's hilarious about Trump is that he can't help but say what's at the top of his [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=871.28s)]
*  mind, right? So he just jumps in and he's like, yeah, we were panicking. People got the yippies. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=878.3199999999999s)]
*  I didn't know what to do. I panicked and I withdrew them. And then Hannity and Ingram look at him and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=883.68s)]
*  go, genius, art of the deal. Okay, all right, look, the amount of lying that happens in American media [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=888.4s)]
*  is unbelievable. It's just really, it's astounding. They're not doing new shows. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=897.28s)]
*  Obviously, they're doing propaganda shows. Okay, but I wanna go to the bond markets [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=901.76s)]
*  cuz that part's super important. It's complicated as to why the bond market went down here. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=904.88s)]
*  There's a lot of factors. I'm gonna summarize it and kind of get to the point here. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=911.12s)]
*  Because as I said earlier, if the stock market goes down, bond markets are supposed to go up. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  It's a safe haven for money. They move it from the markets to the bonds. But in this case, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=920.64s)]
*  something really weird started to happen last night. And that's why there was another layer [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  of panic, which is that the bond markets were going down. Why? Partly because of what Gasparino [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=929.84s)]
*  was saying and that might be a huge part of it. So while the Trump administration was pretending [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=935.2s)]
*  that Japan is on its knees and ready to negotiate, in reality, Japan started selling off bonds in a [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=939.44s)]
*  way that created a massive problem for us. Cuz two of the largest bondholders for US [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=946.08s)]
*  treasuries are Japan and China. And so there was also speculation. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=950.64s)]
*  And most importantly, guys, people started to lose faith in the credit of the United States [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=956.16s)]
*  that maybe we couldn't pay back the treasury bonds. And if that happens, that is catastrophic. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=962.88s)]
*  Cuz interest rates would go through the roof. The interest we pay on our debt is already at [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=970.08s)]
*  over $900 billion a year, and that would skyrocket. But more important than even that [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=975.68s)]
*  is that if the world loses the faith in the US dollar, they will shift to another currency. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=983.52s)]
*  And that'll be catastrophic for America, catastrophic. That's actually one of the [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  theories as to why Dick Cheney wanted to go into Iraq so bad. Cuz Saddam Hussein wanted to [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=996.16s)]
*  move oil off of the dollar. So that's how important that is. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1000.72s)]
*  So when you piss off the two countries that hold the largest US treasuries, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  even if they were doing it on their own, which I don't think it was just them, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1010.08s)]
*  based on all the reporting that I've seen, that would already be a massive danger to America. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1013.12s)]
*  So these enormous tariffs were as big an economic blunder as I have ever seen in my life. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1018.5600000000001s)]
*  And I really, I can't believe the bond markets and the stock market went down at the same time. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1027.04s)]
*  And I'm not the only one. That's why Trump changed his mind after officials came in and [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  started telling him, Mr. President, you're not understanding what's happening. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  We're about to blow up our entire economy. And so he didn't wanna back off, but he didn't have a [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1042.24s)]
*  choice. And by the way, Navarro, who is pushing, we're gonna rebuild manufacturing, these tariffs [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1048.56s)]
*  are gonna last forever, sidelined. Navarro not to be seen anymore. Now Besant, who was against [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1053.6s)]
*  the tariffs in the first place, the Treasury Secretary is back in charge in that regard. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1058.7199999999998s)]
*  And I appreciate you guys writing in, Muffin Man wrote in on YouTube member section. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1062.7199999999998s)]
*  Jake predicted this long ago that Trump would act like he got something when he didn't. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1067.76s)]
*  And of course, in this case, to be fair to Trump, he's not even saying it. He's saying, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1071.52s)]
*  I don't know, I'm panicked. And we got the impies. So no, the right-wing media like Fox News is lying [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1075.52s)]
*  on his behalf. But I appreciate you pointing out that I said that's exactly what would happen, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1080.72s)]
*  and it is what happened. And then Navinix and tyt.com member section with a less sophisticated [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1084.96s)]
*  point, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. He said, not art of the deal, the fart of the deal. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay, let's look at the poll, see who's watching, who says no, no, Trump nailed it. This was actually [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1095.84s)]
*  the art of the deal and not a giant L. It's in a live chat, shows obviously live at 6 o'clock [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1102.88s)]
*  Eastern on YouTube. Are the deals at 8%, 8%, hang in there guys. This will be proven to be a genius [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1107.44s)]
*  move at a later date. But hey, by the way, I love that you're watching, keep an open mind. All right. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1113.76s)]
*  Yeah, when you were talking about you said the word a safe haven, right, regarding the money [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1120.3200000000002s)]
*  markets. And I asked you at the top of this show a little bit facetiously if you thought there was [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1127.68s)]
*  possibly some political win that Trump was able to eke out with all of this. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1132.64s)]
*  The answer as he said was no, but it's not just no, things are so much worse now than they were [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1136.96s)]
*  a week ago. Thank you also mentioned, but I'll remind the audience that ever since we had that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1141.2s)]
*  rebound effect. I mean, this all happened within like 24 hours, right? So we had that rebound [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1145.8400000000001s)]
*  effect, still didn't get us back up to where we were, but things have dropped again, right, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1150.4s)]
*  as of a few hours ago. So things are still very volatile. All this is happening [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1155.68s)]
*  within very, very short windows of time. But people around the world are now losing [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1159.92s)]
*  faith in our entire nation and our entire monetary system. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1164.88s)]
*  The United States is known and really has been known for decades as being a very stable and [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1168.64s)]
*  reliable market. We simply are not that anymore. Our international reputation, especially on our [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1174.5600000000002s)]
*  financial reputation internationally, is shattered. And that is not something that can be easily [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1181.44s)]
*  regained, easily rebuilt. Maybe if we do something drastic like get rid of Trump and get rid of all [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1186.8s)]
*  of his people and just have somebody come back in and say, we're sorry, we won't do that anymore. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1192.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe there's a chance of something like that happening. But as of right now, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1198.6399999999999s)]
*  as far as the world is concerned, we as the American people are still backing this guy. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  This is still what we want. This is the man that we elected knowing that he was going to do these [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1207.76s)]
*  tariffs, or at least knowing that he was going to threaten tariffs and manipulate the markets the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1212.32s)]
*  way that he has. So either way, it's not good for us. And the fact that Fox News is still even [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1216.96s)]
*  trying to pretend that Trump knew what he was doing all along and that all of this is a good [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1223.04s)]
*  outcome and that we're the ones over here freaking out because of like we were being so [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1227.76s)]
*  sensationalist about how bad this was. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1233.6s)]
*  It's unconscionable and it really like they're doing a disservice to their audience members. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1236.8s)]
*  They should not be lying to these people because these actions of their current administration [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1241.36s)]
*  are going to have real world implications for average Americans, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1246.7199999999998s)]
*  including people who voted for Trump. And I hope they remember that come November. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNNAjiyb18&t=1250.7199999999998s)]
