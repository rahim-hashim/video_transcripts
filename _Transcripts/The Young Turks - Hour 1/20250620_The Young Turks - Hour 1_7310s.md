# Trump Throws Tulsi Gabbard UNDER THE BUS. Laura Loomer Claims Tucker Is “CONTROLLED By Muslims
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco)
*  Hello and welcome to Fotis Life علي withoutza faveira. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=0.0s)]
*  has just been, you know, not good. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=46.3s)]
*  I'm so upset. Oh my God. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=59.66s)]
*  Drop it like it's needless war plans against Iran. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=89.66s)]
*  All right, welcome to the Turks Power Panel. Cenk Huger, John Adarola, Trey Crowder with [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=119.66s)]
*  you guys. Trey's comedian, he's the host of the Weekly Skews podcast. I get it, it's a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=126.22s)]
*  play on news. And John is also- [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=132.66s)]
*  So nothing past you, buddy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=136.22s)]
*  Well, listen, man, that's why I'm here all week. So sharp. And John, of course, hosts [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=138.22s)]
*  a damage report like, Trump's president. I wonder what the damage report is. Let's check [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=145.62s)]
*  that out at 1pm Eastern every day. All right, so we got a lot of news for you guys. We're [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=151.5s)]
*  still asking on the website, one of our more popular questions on tyt.com. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=157.54s)]
*  Should we form a coalition with the right against the war with Iran? Well, that's going [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=161.86s)]
*  to be in the rundown a lot today because there's internal fighting. But then are they gonna [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=166.1s)]
*  cave into Trump anyway? We're gonna find out all of that. So John, let's get started. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=172.14s)]
*  Yeah, there was a fascinating development in the last day. But anyway, we are gonna [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=176.7s)]
*  start on that and probably talk about that for the majority of the show. It's war, it's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=179.66s)]
*  justified. But let's start off with this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=183.9s)]
*  Regarding the ongoing situation in Iran, I know there has been a lot of speculation amongst [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=187.7s)]
*  all of you in the media regarding the president's decision making and whether or not the United [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=191.9s)]
*  States will be directly involved. In light of that news, I have a message directly from [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=196.38s)]
*  the president and I quote, based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=201.06s)]
*  that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=207.18s)]
*  I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=210.58s)]
*  It was strange admittedly to get updates about the possibility of war from the press secretary [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  rather than from truth social, but we'll go with it. So it could be two weeks. But is [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=221.9s)]
*  that actually him looking for diplomacy? Is that him buying a little bit of time to set [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=228.66s)]
*  up our attack? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=234.74s)]
*  Cenk, what do you make of that? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=236.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so curious what you guys think about it because I think he's trying to, he's basically [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  saying all right, MAGA and neocons, you guys fight and then whoever wins and is more popular, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=244.9s)]
*  I'll go on your side. That's my read of Trump and why he's doing this two weeks. Plus he [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=250.78s)]
*  wants to get Iran back to the negotiating table so that he could declare that you see [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=255.62s)]
*  that I was a tough guy and then I got peace. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=260.7s)]
*  That'd be perfect for Trump's brand, right? I'm both tough and anti-war. So he's trying [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=264.02s)]
*  to thread that needle. Whether that'll work is an entirely different question. Which side [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=271.14s)]
*  is he finally going to end up on? Different question. How is MAGA going to react? Different [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=277.06s)]
*  question and those are all the questions we gotta tackle. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=282.26s)]
*  Yeah, at the end of the day, look, if we do not directly enter into the war, then on that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=285.3s)]
*  he gets, I guess, a little bit of anti-war, although that's just maintaining a status [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  quo of Biden and go in. But he also said that with me as president, we have stability. People [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=294.62s)]
*  don't do attacks like Russia did with Ukraine and with Hamas and everything except it's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=300.38s)]
*  not the case. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=304.98s)]
*  Israel felt totally free to attack whoever they want. This isn't even the first place [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=305.98s)]
*  in the since he became president. So he does have to answer for that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=310.22s)]
*  Yeah, I just got a gentleman real quick on that. Guys, it's even worse than that, right? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=314.38s)]
*  Cuz he always says like, that war would have never started if I was president. Would have [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=318.38s)]
*  never started, right? But in this case, not only did it start under Trump, but Netanyahu [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=322.66s)]
*  defied Trump in starting the war. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=328.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=331.18s)]
*  He said, I don't care what you think. I don't work for you, you work for me. And I'm gonna [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=332.18s)]
*  start this war and then you're gonna have to think through for two weeks if you're my [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  bitch or not. And so that's a decision Trump's trying to make. So don't tell me that wars [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=339.1s)]
*  wouldn't have started under you when a giant one just started and you're thinking of joining [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=343.54s)]
*  it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=347.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. But let's try to work through some of the insider information to figure [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=348.58000000000004s)]
*  out how likely it is that we will actually get ourselves involved in this war. Because [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=352.58000000000004s)]
*  there's evidence that points in both directions and I'm not 100% certain I know exactly what [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=356.72s)]
*  he's thinking. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=362.5s)]
*  I'm not certain that he knows exactly what he's thinking. But anyway, some are saying [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=363.5s)]
*  in the administration that the two week timeline is that he is very worried, seriously worried [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=367.98s)]
*  about the lasting impacts of regime change, which would be nice. It's good to see a president [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=375.70000000000005s)]
*  actually thinking through what happens after a regime is toppled. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=380.70000000000005s)]
*  He apparently doesn't wanna turn Iran into Libya, said one insider familiar with the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=384.22s)]
*  deliberations that are going on. He apparently in recent days has specifically mentioned [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=388.88s)]
*  Libya's decade long plunge into anarchy in 2011 after the US joined a NATO bombing campaign [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=393.82s)]
*  to oust Gaddafi. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=398.62s)]
*  That's according to three different sources. But, and this is where it's much more typical [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=400.18s)]
*  Trump administration stuff. They do believe that if we engage in war and the regime is [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=405.26s)]
*  toppled and stuff like that happens, it isn't actually his fault anyway. The insider said [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=410.18s)]
*  Libya was a much more extended kind of bombing commitment and it ended up being regime change. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=414.94s)]
*  If the regime falls in Iran, then it's not on Trump, because that's not the goal of his [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=420.68s)]
*  very limited strike. I would love to have an actual man in charge if we're gonna have [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=424.6s)]
*  something that looks like a man, somebody who takes responsibility for what they do. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=430.66s)]
*  Your goal has no, it doesn't matter. If you strike them, if you, for instance, as they're [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  now talking about, potentially do assassinate the leader and it does fall into a civil war, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=440.44s)]
*  massive infighting, failed state or whatever. It is very small comfort to say, but that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=446.84s)]
*  wasn't my goal. It was limited striking. It was just a decapitation attack. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=451.52s)]
*  And so, no, they're not gonna take responsibility if that ends up happening. But I do like hearing [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  that at least it's something they're thinking about. And so, some people are saying that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=461.84s)]
*  it isn't actually about buying time for diplomacy. And it could be Trump is still saying you [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=467.23999999999995s)]
*  want some kind of deal. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=473.34s)]
*  Although right before we went live, he said that Europe, I guess, isn't allowed to talk [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=474.34s)]
*  to Iran. And Iran doesn't wanna talk to them anyway. But others are saying that it's just [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=478.17999999999995s)]
*  to buy time to set up for the actual attack. Apparently, it would provide time for a second [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  American aircraft carrier to get into place. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  So that if we do the attack and we need to defend against the counterattack, we would [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=491.41999999999996s)]
*  have more material in the area to do that. It would also provide Israel more time to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=495.29999999999995s)]
*  destroy the air defenses around the site that we would be attacking with our bunker busters. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=500.22s)]
*  And so, there really is evidence to support both conclusions, that this is serious or [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=505.94000000000005s)]
*  that it's not. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=510.98s)]
*  I mean, the third sort of related topic to the last one is, it's two weeks to get Iran [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=511.98s)]
*  to put down their defenses a little bit. And then maybe you wake up tomorrow in the middle [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=517.1s)]
*  of the night, we launch the attack. I mean, he's definitely not above lying. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=521.94s)]
*  No, for sure. And look, guys, there's a good argument to be made that it's to prepare. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=527.1s)]
*  And I was gonna say the same thing as John. It could be just to do a surprise attack. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=531.38s)]
*  We're gonna come in two weeks. Just like Israel did a surprise attack on them in the middle [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=535.42s)]
*  of our so-called peace negotiations, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=540.22s)]
*  So it's not like they didn't just do this like a minute ago. Having said that, I don't [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=542.78s)]
*  think that's what it is. Why? Because Israeli officials are mad at the delay. They're like, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=547.86s)]
*  we already gave you an order, and now you're gonna take two weeks to do our order? How [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=553.9s)]
*  dare you? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=560.22s)]
*  So when I see quotes like that, and obviously I'm paraphrasing, okay, in the press with [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=561.34s)]
*  Israeli officials upset at the American government for delaying. Then I think, okay, no, he is [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=566.42s)]
*  actually delaying. And unless it's like an enormously elaborate surprise attack and they've [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=572.62s)]
*  coordinated the Israeli officials pretending to be upset. But I tend to doubt that. Trey, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=578.34s)]
*  what do you think? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=583.66s)]
*  Well, I think we can all agree, generally as Americans, we can rest easy in the comfort [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=584.66s)]
*  of knowing that whatever decision Donald Trump ultimately makes, it's sure to be the most [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=590.0600000000001s)]
*  level headed and diplomatic option available to him. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=595.66s)]
*  No, obviously terrified of the exact opposite. He probably is trying to have it both ways. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=598.78s)]
*  Maybe there's something to, like you said, Cenk, about having them fight it out, kind [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=605.98s)]
*  of give it a minute, see which side comes out on top. But I'm, in spite of what I said [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=610.14s)]
*  a minute ago, very confident that whatever he ends up doing, it's not gonna be great. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=614.58s)]
*  And as far, at least like John mentioned, at least they even somewhat acknowledge that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=618.26s)]
*  regime change is sometimes bad. I feel like we've had a pretty poor batting average with [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=623.94s)]
*  those as a country, but doesn't stop us from stepping up back up to the plate usually. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=630.0600000000001s)]
*  So I'm not feeling overly confident that we'll avoid World War III potentially or whatever, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=635.0999999999999s)]
*  but I certainly hope so. I hope that level heads prevail, but I don't know. We'll see. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=640.6999999999999s)]
*  He could be just kicking the can down the road and waiting for it to shake out somehow [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=645.9799999999999s)]
*  in some other fashion. I don't think it's, whatever the shrewdest thing is he could be [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=651.02s)]
*  doing, I don't think it's that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=655.18s)]
*  So- Yeah, in terms of the kicking the can down the road, it's also possible. I mean, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=656.54s)]
*  there was initial reports that he didn't want Israel to do this. That's now very well established, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=660.86s)]
*  no matter how much Carolyn Lee would pretend that this was always the plan. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=667.1s)]
*  And then he saw that Israel was pretty impressive in the first few days, and now he wants in on it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  He's feeling like FOMO or whatever. And so if the two weeks go by and it's still going well, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=676.7s)]
*  then maybe he thinks, well, this is a pretty safe thing. I can get us involved or whatever. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=681.9000000000001s)]
*  And he's not gonna wanna look weak by virtue of the fact that Israel has just been doing this. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=686.86s)]
*  Or alternatively, if it starts to fail and the perception is that Israel needed Trump's help, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=691.5s)]
*  but he didn't provide it, then he could look weak in that respect. Which is why I just believe that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=697.5799999999999s)]
*  it seems inevitable that we're gonna do something. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=703.5799999999999s)]
*  Now, are we gonna be marching 50,000 soldiers across the border? I don't know, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=705.42s)]
*  but it's a massive country with a big military and these sorts of things can balloon out of control. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=709.18s)]
*  I think, and we already know that he approved some sort of strike plans, including potentially [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=713.98s)]
*  the use of these bunker busters. I feel like that's pretty much a lock at this point. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=719.4200000000001s)]
*  Again, I really hope that I am wrong, but I think it's entirely possible that he does that. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=723.5s)]
*  And if he does that, then it's almost certain that there will be reprisal attacks against [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=727.98s)]
*  the United States or its forces or its allies. And that's very consequential. He could have been [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=731.74s)]
*  in signing these orders, signing effectively the death warrant for a lot of our soldiers [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=736.22s)]
*  in the region. And he has to know that. And for him to do this when it didn't even seem like this [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=741.0200000000001s)]
*  is really, like he wanted to be involved. I'm always ready to bad mouth and give him [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=746.3000000000001s)]
*  the least charitable interpretation of his motives. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=751.82s)]
*  And- That's true. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=754.5400000000001s)]
*  I have Trump derangement syndrome. But it doesn't seem like two weeks ago he was hot for war with [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=755.34s)]
*  Iran, I'll give him that credit. And so for him to be manipulated or led into it is even more [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=760.0600000000001s)]
*  pathetic than him just being the hawk that he could have been or some other Republican president [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=765.5s)]
*  would have been. And so it really is feeling like we're gonna be dragged in. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=771.18s)]
*  My best bet is we're gonna engage in, we're gonna try to destroy Fordo. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=775.18s)]
*  And depending on Iranian reprisals, maybe get drawn in and maybe it becomes a bigger thing. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=779.58s)]
*  Maybe it becomes a thing that involves years of conflict. I don't know. But there is the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=785.34s)]
*  Steve Bannon factor. I know we're gonna be talking about that later in the show. What do you think? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=789.9s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm gonna touch on that a little bit. It's two things I want to go over. So [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=793.26s)]
*  where do the different parts of the Republican Party stand? So and who's the most culpable? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  So the worst of the whole lot are the Republican politicians in Congress. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=802.46s)]
*  Outside of Thomas Massie, they're all warmongers. Marjorie Taylor Greene is on the bubble. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=806.9399999999999s)]
*  She hasn't joined the War Powers Resolution, which would prevent the president from declaring war. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=812.62s)]
*  So right now she's full of crap. She hasn't taken action to actually oppose the war. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=818.9399999999999s)]
*  She tweeted. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=824.14s)]
*  Yeah, she tweets, right? And then look, by the way, that's better than not opposing it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=825.5s)]
*  And she's doing that because her own voters are pushing her to do that, which I'll come back to. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=830.54s)]
*  Okay, so but the Republicans are 99% corrupt. Other than Tom Massie, they all love the idea [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=836.14s)]
*  of this war and can't wait to serve APAC loyally. So that's a stone cold fact. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=842.7s)]
*  If you're a Republican voter out there and you want to defend your precious little politicians, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=848.78s)]
*  go look at their voting record. Go see if they joined Massie in trying to assert [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=853.5s)]
*  constitutional authority for Congress to prevent war. They didn't, okay? So that's clear. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=858.7s)]
*  Trump is kind of, he's in the middle. Why? Because he's a good guy? No, he's in the middle because his [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=863.98s)]
*  base, in my opinion, is largely against the war. But his donors are all for the war. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=871.5s)]
*  And so he's like, and then he's got to surround himself with a bunch of neocons that Mary Madele [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=877.58s)]
*  said ask him to hire. And they're all like, sir, this is very dangerous. You'll look really weak [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=882.46s)]
*  and pathetic unless you just absolutely destroy Iran. I mean, are you gonna look so silly and [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=887.18s)]
*  not Trump a bunker buster? I mean, you're looking weaker by the minute now. And Israel did this [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=893.5s)]
*  brilliant strike. Okay, so let's just pause there for a real quick story. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=899.66s)]
*  So part of the reason that we first put out a statement saying, hey, we didn't have anything [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=904.3s)]
*  to do with this. Marco Rubio did that on the first night. And then by the morning, Trump had [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=908.78s)]
*  changed to, yeah, we were involved. We gave them intelligence. We deserve credit. Wait, why credit? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=913.5799999999999s)]
*  Right? This Fox News ran a segment that morning saying that Israel's strikes were brilliant and [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=919.1s)]
*  strong. So Trump then thought, I wanna be brilliant and strong. I was in on it. I was in on it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=925.5s)]
*  It's in my credit for that. He's such a simple minded guy, right? But the fact that there's a [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=932.06s)]
*  countervailing force is what's so interesting. Because that never existed. Guys, we're the [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=938.54s)]
*  longest running show in internet history. I covered the Iraq war before it got started. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=945.1s)]
*  There was no countervailing force, none, zero on the right. They were all like, yes, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=950.5400000000001s)]
*  let's attack. Okay, 100% of them, including Tucker Carlson at the time, including Donald Trump at the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=957.98s)]
*  time, all of them. Okay, some of them switched a little later. Some of them switched way, way, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=964.3000000000001s)]
*  way later, decades later, right? And pretending they were against it. No, they were all for it, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=969.5s)]
*  okay? So now, finally we get to the bag of voters. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=973.74s)]
*  So no, more than half of them are actually into war. I know that a lot of people on the left, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=977.42s)]
*  no way, no way, you're crazy. They're all called to say, we're gonna talk more about it later in [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=982.14s)]
*  the show. But guys, why would the voters lie? It's not like MAGA's shy about their opinions. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=987.66s)]
*  It's not like they're worried about offending you. And all the other issues are like, yeah, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=994.54s)]
*  goddamn immigrants, round them all up. Send in the Marines, right? They're not shy. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=999.74s)]
*  They're not a politician. They're not taking donor money. They have no reason to lie to you. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1005.34s)]
*  No, they really don't want the war. Like any of you say, okay, they're right. They all work for [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1009.74s)]
*  Laura Loomer. Do they? Cuz Laura Loomer is fighting Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1014.14s)]
*  So if they all follow her orders, does that mean they MAGA hates Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1019.1s)]
*  No, they're actually split. They're actually split. So now that doesn't mean they're not [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1024.46s)]
*  gonna fall back in line. We'll talk about that later in the show. Okay, so now what do I think's [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1029.58s)]
*  gonna happen? This is the hardest one of all, because I mean, Donald Trump nailed it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1033.58s)]
*  This is a hilarious beginning to a sentence. Wait for the second half. When he said, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1038.78s)]
*  nobody knows what I'm gonna do. I'll probably do a sentence in the last second. I'd like to do that. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1044.78s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, that sounds like him, yep. So even Donald Trump doesn't know what he's gonna do. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1048.54s)]
*  So we're all guessing based on what we think we know about Trump, his base, his donors and [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1053.02s)]
*  all this stuff. So what's my guess? 75-25 that he bombs them, okay? So why? Because Iran is not [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1058.3s)]
*  gonna come back to the table and do an unconditional surrender. That's what Trump wants. Now, before, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1066.54s)]
*  they almost had a deal where Iran said, we'll stop enriching uranium at the military, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1072.06s)]
*  where we get anywhere near the military level. And we'll enrich uranium under controlled [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1077.74s)]
*  circumstances, monitor for just energy purposes, which is what they were doing in the past, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1082.1399999999999s)]
*  which is basically the Obama deal, right? And Israel said, no, we veto that deal. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1086.86s)]
*  They have to take away their entire uranium program. But that for them, for whatever reason, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1092.54s)]
*  is a red line. And they view that to be a national humiliation if they have to do that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1097.34s)]
*  So it is very, very unlikely they'll do that. So since Iran is not going to come back and go, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1102.2199999999998s)]
*  okay, we pray y'all, we surrender, we surrender, dear Donald Trump. He's probably gonna take [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1107.8999999999999s)]
*  offense to that. He's gonna be easier to manipulate. So 75-25, at least, he attacks. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1113.5s)]
*  And MAGA's not helping at this point cuz they're retreating a lot of them, like Bannon and Trump. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1118.94s)]
*  I mean, Bannon and Tucker, I'll tell you in a minute, not in a minute, but a little bit later [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1123.26s)]
*  in the show, are beginning to retreat. Okay, so last thing is, then what do I think is gonna happen [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1127.98s)]
*  after the bombing, if that happens? Well, Israel's gonna say, not good enough. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1134.46s)]
*  You didn't destroy their whole facility. You should have dropped a nuke. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1138.78s)]
*  You should have done ground troops. You should have done regime change. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1141.98s)]
*  And Israel might assassinate Ayatollah Khamenei as they are threatening to do now, okay? In which [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1145.4199999999998s)]
*  case, we'll be in the middle of a giant mess. And then Trump will get more and more and more [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1150.78s)]
*  unpopular. MAGA will then, the half of MAGA that hated the war will go, I thought we were just [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1155.82s)]
*  dropping a bomb and now we're in the middle of this giant mess, just like we didn't want to be, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1161.82s)]
*  right? And this is the super bold prediction. And I understand there's a series of steps to even get [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1165.58s)]
*  to a place where this might happen. But if all that happens, I think that Donald Trump [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1172.3s)]
*  will leave in the middle of the war. And Israel will be like, wait, what? You can't leave in the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1177.5s)]
*  middle of the war. We're in this war together. And Trump will be like, I don't know, it's costing [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1182.22s)]
*  too much. MAGA doesn't like it. It hurt my popularity. Where's my new bribe? If you don't [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1187.02s)]
*  have a new bribe, I'm gone. Okay, that's my guess. Well, we'll see. I hope none of that happens. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1191.98s)]
*  I hope we don't bomb them. Trey, thoughts. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1197.26s)]
*  Yeah, I also hope we don't bomb them. And I'm also not overly optimistic for like 75, 25. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1200.46s)]
*  That's probably pretty good odds, because when the last time we chose not to bomb a place, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1205.98s)]
*  we spent all this money on all these sweet toys. There's a lot of people in DC that just [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1210.8600000000001s)]
*  really like to use them. War is a big cottage industry over here in the US. So I mean, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1215.42s)]
*  I'm always worried that we're gonna leap into another one. I agree with you too. I'm also glad [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1222.78s)]
*  that there just are even factions, like you said, a countervailing force on the right right now. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1227.8200000000002s)]
*  And it's been weird. It does make for like strange bedfellows, because so far, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1233.1000000000001s)]
*  the ones who are against it, a lot of times it's the more typically loonier type of Republican, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1237.1000000000001s)]
*  the more hardcore like MAGA type. So it's been put me in position. I never thought of being before [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1243.26s)]
*  like watching Tucker Carlson dressed down, Ted Cruz. And I'm sitting there thinking like, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1248.06s)]
*  hell man, Tucker spit and get him Tucker. It's like, I never thought I'd think that [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1253.1s)]
*  was that's just a testament to just how much Ted Cruz sucks. But like it is, it is, you know, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1256.7s)]
*  it's weird sort of agreeing with him on anything, but this is we're talking about war here. And [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1262.46s)]
*  it's like, whether whatever their motivations are, because a lot of people said about Tucker and [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1267.34s)]
*  some of those types, it's like, it's just because he's a Russian stooge. And that's what Russia wants [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1271.02s)]
*  or whatever. But it's like, you know, it's still kind of, they can fall back backwards into being [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1275.02s)]
*  right about any one given thing. You know, they say about broken clocks and blind squirrels and [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1279.9s)]
*  all that. I just don't want there to be war, but I'm worried that there will, because like you guys [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1284.54s)]
*  said, it just, it just feels like the thing that we would do in any administration. But this one in [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1289.82s)]
*  particular, also, I'll say this is, seems like maybe one of the worst times in any of our living [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1294.46s)]
*  memory for a new war to start, given the leadership at the top of our military right now. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1299.18s)]
*  They don't exactly inspire confidence. So that's also alarming. But yeah, we'll see what happens, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1306.78s)]
*  but I'm not feeling great about it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1313.98s)]
*  Yeah, at the very least, thanks to that leadership, we'll finally have a bit more [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1315.26s)]
*  transparency during the war. I mean, if you're curious how it's developing, just get in the [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1318.22s)]
*  signal group with all the details as they develop. But we have a development that I think we should [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1321.8200000000002s)]
*  briefly talk about. One of the things that's made me most worried that Donald Trump is going to [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1327.02s)]
*  engage in bombing Iran is his recent assertions that they are developing a nuclear weapon and [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1333.02s)]
*  could have them in weeks or months, even though that is not what our intelligence community [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1339.02s)]
*  thinks. He reiterated that earlier today, saying they could have it in weeks. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1343.74s)]
*  And when he was told that our intelligence agencies, which just once again reiterated that [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1347.34s)]
*  that is not the case, when he said, when he was asked about that, he said then our intelligence [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1351.74s)]
*  community is wrong. And so this is feeling super run up to the war in Iraq. Just again, baseless [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1356.14s)]
*  belief that we have to go in there because of weapons of mass destruction. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1362.94s)]
*  And one of the interesting sort of factional fights that developed from this was that to [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1366.38s)]
*  assert that he had to contradict Tulsi Gabbard specifically, who had testified in March [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1371.8200000000002s)]
*  that they were not developing a nuclear weapon. And he seems dead set on the idea that she was [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1378.0600000000002s)]
*  wrong. And that was fascinating. Tulsi Gabbard maybe being pushed out of the administration [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1383.74s)]
*  because she stood for the truth for once. And we have a little bit of an update on that. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1389.5s)]
*  But first, here is Donald Trump being asked about this disagreement. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1393.98s)]
*  I think within a matter of weeks or certainly within a matter of months, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1397.1s)]
*  they're gonna be able to have a nuclear weapon. We can't let that happen. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1401.9s)]
*  What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon? Your intelligence [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1404.7s)]
*  community has said they have no evidence that they are at this point. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1408.14s)]
*  Well, then my intelligence community is wrong. Who in the intelligence community said that? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1411.26s)]
*  Your director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1416.06s)]
*  She's wrong. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1418.94s)]
*  She's wrong. And remember, Tulsi Gabbard didn't just say that they don't have weapons. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1421.18s)]
*  A week ago, she put out a really flashy Russian style video about World War III. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1426.06s)]
*  She seems to actually not want us to engage in actions that could lead to nuclear war. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1431.66s)]
*  And so finally, you have Donald Trump, who seems to be willing to gobble up propaganda [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1436.62s)]
*  and spread it baselessly to get us into a war. And Tulsi Gabbard standing for the truth, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1440.78s)]
*  which after the last few years is refreshing. And if that makes you uncomfortable, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1445.8999999999999s)]
*  it's not actually going in that way because Tulsi Gabbard just tweeted. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1450.62s)]
*  The dishonest media is intentionally taking my testimony out of context and spreading fake [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1454.3799999999999s)]
*  news as a way to manufacture division. America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1459.42s)]
*  can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months if they decide to finalize the assembly. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1464.1399999999999s)]
*  President Trump has been clear that can't happen and I agree. They took it out of context. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1468.86s)]
*  She said in March, the US continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1475.8999999999999s)]
*  and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1480.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1484.78s)]
*  She had more to lose her job. That's it. This is utterly pathetic. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1485.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm so glad you read that second comment, John, because I was about to give her credit. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1488.62s)]
*  Because and I did when it first happened, I was like, I thought Tulsi was gonna be in favor of [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1494.7s)]
*  war against the Muslim country, to be honest. And so I didn't believe her that she was anti-war. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1501.3400000000001s)]
*  And so when she came out and said, no, Iran's not developing a nuclear weapon. I was like, all right, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1506.6200000000001s)]
*  we're credited. We're credited, dude, that's true. And that's kind of an anti-war position. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1510.5400000000002s)]
*  I now take it all back. Okay, so she's now bending an A and saying she's totally lying, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1514.7800000000002s)]
*  totally lying, 100% lying. And by the way, it's important to note on behalf of Israel, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1522.3s)]
*  not on behalf of us. We got nothing to do with that war, nothing to do with that war. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1529.66s)]
*  So now let me go to Ted Cruz real quick. So he was with Tucker Carlson, you guys know, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1534.46s)]
*  yeah, Carlson humiliated him as Trey was referring to there. And when Tucker asked him, hey, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1537.9s)]
*  what's so great about Israel? I mean, that's a very rough paraphrase, right? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1545.66s)]
*  Ted Cruz was like, they're our greatest ally. And okay, yeah, but other than them giving you, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1550.06s)]
*  did AIPAC giving you millions of dollars, why are they our greatest ally? He said because they [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1556.86s)]
*  share intelligence with us. Yeah, false intelligence in order to push us into a war, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1561.1799999999998s)]
*  which was where we got the fake intelligence about the WMD in Iraq. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1567.74s)]
*  And now we have fake intelligence about Iran to push us into a war with Iran. With allies like [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1572.1399999999999s)]
*  that, you don't need enemies. They just create enemies for you. They create giant wars for you. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1577.18s)]
*  And then what's the second reason he gave? He said the people that hate them also hate us. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1581.98s)]
*  I wonder why. Did it ever occur to you that the people who hate them hate us? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1589.3400000000001s)]
*  Because we back all of their wars against those people and that we fund Israel and their war [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1594.22s)]
*  crimes and their aggressive attacks against those countries. Gee, did that ever occur to you, Ted? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1601.58s)]
*  So they're all enormously corrupt. If you're trying to figure out who's [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1607.58s)]
*  better, Ted Cruz or Tucker Carlson on this, that is not a close question. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1611.58s)]
*  You could say blind squirrel, you could say anything you want about Tucker Carlson. There's [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1616.14s)]
*  a lot of terrible things to say about Tucker Carlson. But on this, Ted Cruz is 100% corrupt [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1619.18s)]
*  and totally and utterly works for Israel. And just the fact that Tucker Carlson doesn't work [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1625.9s)]
*  for Israel is shocking in Washington. That anyone that has any degree of power and is on the right [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1630.38s)]
*  wing doesn't work for Israel. So super last thing is, you really wanna unite and you guys do. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1637.1000000000001s)]
*  Phil Lowery just became a member, hit the join button below on YouTube, we appreciate you, Phil. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1642.7s)]
*  Then Rodin, this is at least an opportunity to form groups and plan protests and whatever else [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1646.6200000000001s)]
*  we can do to show our disgust with the thought of entering a foreign war unprovoked. Look, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1651.18s)]
*  we started unitedagainstwar.com. Dave Smith, who's a prominent libertarian, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1656.22s)]
*  came on the show a couple of days ago and says, I'll unite against war. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1660.94s)]
*  Yes, the libertarians are against it, progressives are against it. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1664.22s)]
*  What would be amazing is if MAGA actually lived up to what they were gonna say. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1668.22s)]
*  Trump is asking you, if you're MAGA, to put pressure on him so he could decide who's stronger, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1672.94s)]
*  MAGA or the neocons. So MAGA, are you just gonna let the neocons win? Or are you just gonna [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1678.94s)]
*  surrender to them? Or are you gonna go out there? I mean, imagine seeing a right-wing protest of a [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1684.7s)]
*  war. I'm not sure I've ever seen that in my entire life. Now, I'm gonna ask you to imagine something [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1689.74s)]
*  that is you're gonna have incredible difficulty imagining. Imagine a right-wing and left-wing [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1696.46s)]
*  protest together of a war. Okay, I think that's what we should do on 4th of July. Okay, but [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1702.14s)]
*  I don't know that I can get anyone else to join that protest. It might be just me out there, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1709.9s)]
*  because the left will say, no, I hate the right so much. I'll never have a beer with them, even if [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1715.18s)]
*  we're gonna ally against the war. The right will say they hate the left and we'll all hate each [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1719.26s)]
*  other. And then Israel will win and we'll attack Iran and get into another giant war. But I'm trying, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1724.14s)]
*  unitedagainstwar.com. Trey, last word. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1730.06s)]
*  Yeah, well, on that note, like John said earlier, starting to feel very run up to the war in Iraq [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1732.06s)]
*  20 years ago or whatever, about the just pretty much baldly lying about them having weapons of [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1738.22s)]
*  mass destruction and everything. And of course, that was never true, but in how back then there [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1744.06s)]
*  was no resistance to it at all. And I feel like that is an important piece of context. It makes [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1747.98s)]
*  it a little more, I don't know if interesting is the right word this time around, but obviously, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1751.9s)]
*  you guys know and remember in 2003, it was a very blood lusty time in America. Like peace was out. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1755.34s)]
*  It was not a big time for being pro peace in 2003. And I know there was some opposition to it, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1762.6200000000001s)]
*  but everybody on the right was 100% united because we wanted vengeance. And even though they had [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1767.26s)]
*  nothing to do with it, it didn't matter. But none of that is happening right here in this scenario. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1771.82s)]
*  And like you said earlier, more than half of MAGA is against this. And I think you're right. I think [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1776.62s)]
*  there's polling that indicates that too. I think most Americans do not want this to happen. And I [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1781.26s)]
*  don't, I'm a dyed in the wool lefty. I don't really get what the problem is even supposed to be [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1787.98s)]
*  with like agreeing with the other side on especially something like that. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1795.18s)]
*  We're talking about war, maybe World War III. Like you can't come together on something like [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1800.46s)]
*  that just because of like whatever political affiliation or just not feeling comfortable with [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1806.22s)]
*  it. Like I don't get that. I feel like anyone who's got any sense should speak out against [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1811.74s)]
*  this particular situation and politics aside. And if we, the people who agree on that, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1817.4199999999998s)]
*  you're allowed to agree and that's okay. It's war, it's bad. Like, let's go. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1822.6999999999998s)]
*  And the right wing would be joining us in an anti-war protest. We're kind of known for anti-war [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1827.34s)]
*  protests. It's not like we didn't invent it, right? So unitedagainstwar.com, we'll have the link in [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1832.9399999999998s)]
*  the description box. We gotta take a break. We'll come back, talk more about some of the specifics [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1838.62s)]
*  of the war, both the actual war and the MAGA Civil War. We'll be right back. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1843.26s)]
*  All right, so guys, we're doing a movie screening next week, Thursday, June 26th with Brave New [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1882.62s)]
*  Films. It's an amazing documentary about Palestinian journalists being murdered by Israel in Gaza. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1902.86s)]
*  So Gaza Journal is under fire, Los Angeles screening. It's free, so just come out. I'll [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1909.1s)]
*  be there. Looking forward to seeing you guys. tyt.com slash event, tyt.com slash event. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1914.3799999999999s)]
*  And don't forget our podcasting network. You can check that out where we get podcasts. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1921.58s)]
*  And then on Shop TYT, we've got Anna saying you're a vile individual to a supporter of Israel [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1925.74s)]
*  who is defending genocide. We made it fun by putting stars on it. Shop tyt.com. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1934.3s)]
*  That is to anyone defending genocide, you're a vile individual. Okay, bloated ego writes in, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1940.06s)]
*  can we have a law that says that the one that's that call for war would be the first ones called [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1945.58s)]
*  up to fight the war, who would ever call for war then? That's a great idea. And if they're too old [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1951.4199999999998s)]
*  to serve, first of all, we can put them in the front lines anyway, just in case. And number two, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1956.06s)]
*  or they can nominate their son or daughter to go to the front lines. But you're not allowed to [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1961.74s)]
*  vote for war unless you or an immediate family member is going to be put on the front lines. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1965.82s)]
*  We'd have zero wars, none. The rich and powerful would never, ever, ever risk themselves or their [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1970.06s)]
*  family. They would only risk yours. And Don Donadragon says this issue is the first time [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1975.34s)]
*  since Luigi that me and my Trump voting friends are advocating for the same thing. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1982.54s)]
*  That's interesting on a couple of fronts. And because of this, they're also turning [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1987.6599999999999s)]
*  their attention to Gaza. The way I see it, we have a chance to defund Israel and expose [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1991.58s)]
*  the average American to how much Citizens United has affected the political system. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=1996.54s)]
*  That's such a great, great comment. The Luigi part, I don't know what you guys get agreed on, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2000.9399999999998s)]
*  I'm a little worried about that part. But the rest of it is fantastic. That's right. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2006.06s)]
*  So number one, I'm now seeing Maga for the first time. Before they're like, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2010.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't want to fund Israel. The ones that are against war, against foreign funding, etc. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2014.22s)]
*  But the Palestinians, I don't really care about, right? Now I've started to see just this [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2019.42s)]
*  smattering of Maga going, yeah, wait, why are we killing all the Palestinians? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2023.82s)]
*  And why are we paying for killing all the Palestinians? And I've even seen a couple [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2029.26s)]
*  because Massey started this. They're getting their cues from, I'm telling you, man, Tom Massey turned [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2033.34s)]
*  out to be a bit of a hero, even if we disagree with him on 90% of stuff. Massey started talking [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2037.74s)]
*  about good Christians aren't in favor of genocide. And so I'm now seeing a couple of people saying, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2042.22s)]
*  yeah, I don't think it's a good idea, is it, on the right? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2047.58s)]
*  And what I would love the most is if this exposed money in politics. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2050.46s)]
*  Because the idea that the Jews control everything is ridiculous. No, money in politics controls [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2055.42s)]
*  everything, big drug companies, etc. And it's beginning to expose that more and more. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2059.58s)]
*  John, you want to say something? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2063.42s)]
*  Yeah, super fast. I was going to say, Tucker Carlson will be like, we shouldn't go to war, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2064.06s)]
*  like sort of pragmatic real politic or whatever. Marjorie Greene, in her tweet, said something [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2067.2599999999998s)]
*  about innocent people shouldn't die. Which even when they oppose war, they don't often [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2071.9s)]
*  acknowledge the moral component of it. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2076.38s)]
*  Yeah, they're beginning knowledge. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2077.98s)]
*  Look, I'm being nice to her in that very limited case. Now sign on to the war powers resolution. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2079.1s)]
*  Yeah, agreed with that. Navinik's right, since just like that MS-13 tattoo, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2083.42s)]
*  probably Mossad drew a picture of a nuke and showed it to Trump. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2086.86s)]
*  And now Trump believes that Israel has a nuke. Might, maybe. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2089.34s)]
*  Hi, back on TOD, Cenk, John and Trey with you guys, but also Philip Lowery who just [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2106.38s)]
*  joined as I said earlier. Two amazing things happened during the breaks. I'm going to say [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2133.5s)]
*  some, repeat it real quick. John said something nice about Marjorie Taylor Greene. It happened. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2136.7s)]
*  I'm a newsman. I report what happened, okay? And Navinik said, just like the, I read this already, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2143.18s)]
*  but I'm going to tell you what I'm reading it again. A member on TOD.com, Navinik said, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2153.42s)]
*  just like the MS-13 tattoo, probably Mossad drew a picture of a nuke and showed it to Trump. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2158.78s)]
*  And now Trump believes Israel has a nuke. Okay, that's really funny. And the reason I brought it [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2162.78s)]
*  back is $100 blue apron gift card. Okay, rewards at TYT.com. That's definitely funny enough to get [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2167.5s)]
*  one of those. Okay, John, what's next? Okay, this is going to be a tough topic, but let's jump into it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2174.1400000000003s)]
*  The moment an Iranian missile slammed into Soropa Hospital in Beersheba this morning. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2184.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh, no. Inside panic and chaos as doctors and patients fled to the bomb shelters. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2190.54s)]
*  This is the largest medical facility in the South. The emergency room was operational at the time of [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2199.5s)]
*  the attack, but there were only minor injuries. Israel is now promising revenge after the Iranian [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2205.74s)]
*  missile that you saw talked about in that video. Did in fact hit one of the country's largest [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2213.74s)]
*  hospitals as they acknowledged, thankfully and perhaps miraculously considering how damaging [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2217.98s)]
*  the attack looked in that case. There were no fatalities as a result of it, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2222.78s)]
*  although there were some injuries. In the larger conflict though, there has been a number of deaths. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2226.7s)]
*  Human rights groups estimate that 639 Iranians and 24 Israelis have been killed since Israel [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2232.22s)]
*  launched this war just about a week ago. And in the context of this particular hospital, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2239.5s)]
*  one might wonder why is that being targeted by Iran? Well, they say or at least the official [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2245.02s)]
*  Iranian news agency says that Iran was targeting the headquarters of the IDF's elite technological [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2249.42s)]
*  unit and an intelligence camp about a mile from the hospital, which Israel says is BS. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2255.18s)]
*  They use a different term. That's basically what they mean. And I mean, it was a mile away, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2261.18s)]
*  which means that either it's BS or their aim is not particularly good. In any event, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2265.74s)]
*  Israel's promising to punish not only Iran, but perhaps directly the leader for this. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2270.7799999999997s)]
*  The Minister of Defense for Israel accused Iran of war crimes of the most serious kind [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2277.5s)]
*  and said that the Ayatollah individually should be held accountable for his crime, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2283.58s)]
*  saying the Prime Minister and I instructed the IDF to increase the intensity of the attacks [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2287.98s)]
*  against strategic targets in Iran and against government targets in Tehran. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2292.62s)]
*  In order to remove the threats against the state of Israel and undermine the regime of the [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2297.18s)]
*  Ayatollahs. So just bear in mind that while the narrative, the logline of the war is that it's [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2301.74s)]
*  supposed to stop the nuclear program of Iran from the very beginning and now they're just stating it, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2307.8199999999997s)]
*  it's attempting to undermine the regime and to murder the members of their government, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2313.5s)]
*  to be very clear. Now, they are saying that attacking a hospital is a crime, is a war crime, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2317.8199999999997s)]
*  which I agree on. And in this particular case, Benjamin Netanyahu appears to agree. Take a look. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2323.58s)]
*  I think it says everything about Israel and about Iran. Israel is fighting to remove the nuclear [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2328.14s)]
*  missile threat aimed at our annihilation. We're targeting military sites, we're targeting nuclear [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2336.62s)]
*  sites, we're targeting missile sites. They're targeting a hospital. In this hospital, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2342.7s)]
*  there are patients who are immobile, they can't even move. Right next to it is a children's ward, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2348.46s)]
*  a baby's ward, infants. They targeted. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2352.94s)]
*  I think striking a hospital is always wrong and we have perhaps, I guess, in comparison to some, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2358.38s)]
*  the luxury here at the Young Turks to condemn it in all cases. Unfortunately, the gentleman that [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2363.82s)]
*  you just saw in that video doesn't do that. He says it tells you everything you need to know [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2368.62s)]
*  that they targeted a hospital. Well, then I ask him, does it tell you everything we need to know [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2373.66s)]
*  about Israel that you have targeted hospitals in Gaza constantly over the past two years? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2378.38s)]
*  In fact, according to the World Health Organization, there have been 697 attacks [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2383.9s)]
*  on healthcare services in Gaza since October 2023. I think it's terrible that Iran hit this one [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2389.6600000000003s)]
*  hospital with this one missile and thank God nobody died. I think it's 697 times worse that [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2395.58s)]
*  Israel has repeatedly done it over and over and over again. And unfortunately, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2402.2200000000003s)]
*  there were no miracles in those cases and many people died. Many civilians died, many children, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2407.82s)]
*  many infants died. And I didn't see a video like that from Netanyahu after each of those attacks [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2414.6200000000003s)]
*  or ever, once ever about the fact that the hospitals and medical facilities had been targeted. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2421.6600000000003s)]
*  As of right now, only 19 of Gaza's 36 hospitals remain operational, including one hospital [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2429.9s)]
*  providing basic care for the remaining patients. They're struggling under severe supply shortages, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2436.3s)]
*  lack of health workers, many obviously have been murdered, persistent insecurity and a [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2441.5s)]
*  surge of casualties all while staff work in impossible conditions, often without water, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2446.0600000000004s)]
*  without electricity. Of the 19 hospitals, 12 provide a variety of health services while the [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2450.54s)]
*  rest are only able to provide basic emergency care. 94% of all hospitals in Gaza are damaged [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2455.5800000000004s)]
*  or destroyed. And this right here, if we bring up this graphic, this is a list of alleged [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2462.78s)]
*  IDF attacks on Gaza hospitals. That's from April to June of this year, many, many months into the [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2467.02s)]
*  conflict, still many, many attacks on these hospitals. And to pull at your heartstrings, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2474.3s)]
*  and I understand why it would as the father of a young child. And then Netanyahu in that video said [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2481.02s)]
*  that there's a ward for babies in that hospital. And so you should be even angrier at Iran, which [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2485.7400000000002s)]
*  you should. But unfortunately, again, very routine during this conflict for Israel to attack Gaza [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2490.7s)]
*  maternity wards. And as I said, I have a really young kid, so I mean, I kind of don't even want [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2496.62s)]
*  to read some of these graphics. But in November of 2023, the IDF forced staff out of a pediatric [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2505.4199999999996s)]
*  intensive care unit at the Al Nasser Children's Hospital to evacuate as they attacked northern [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2513.4199999999996s)]
*  Gaza. People went in with cameras two weeks later after the hospital was evacuated and video [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2518.38s)]
*  appeared to show at least three of five dead infants with the bodies putrefying in close [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2524.54s)]
*  proximity to catheters and ventilators. One baby is seen decomposing while lying alone, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2530.1400000000003s)]
*  appearing to still be connected to an oximeter with a green oxygen tank nearby as insects appear [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2536.1400000000003s)]
*  to crawl on its chest. Those particular babies were not killed by the bombardment, although many, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2541.58s)]
*  many, many have been. They were totally voluntarily killed by the IDF soldiers forcing the doctors [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2548.22s)]
*  to leave them there. That was a totally optional thing that they chose to do. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2555.74s)]
*  And no videos from Benjamin Netanyahu. No, this tells you everything you need to know about a [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2560.7s)]
*  government or its military. Man, I'm trying super hard not to hold it against Israeli civilians [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2565.58s)]
*  who at this late juncture are 80% in favor of continuing to kill people in Gaza. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2573.74s)]
*  Okay, but I'm a much better person than they are. So no, I will not ever hold it against civilians. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2583.74s)]
*  And I hate that Iran hit this hospital. I think it's terrible. And I don't want any hospitals hit. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2589.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't want any civilians killed. Now let's talk about the massive hypocrisy of not just Israel, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2595.58s)]
*  but the American media. So I've heard in American media now dozens of times that 24 people [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2601.98s)]
*  have been killed in Israel, civilians. Again, that's a tragedy. And I don't say that glibly, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2607.34s)]
*  it really is. And by the way, that's why they should be furious at their government [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2611.82s)]
*  for starting this war and thinking, so what? Probably a whole bunch of our citizens will die, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2615.7400000000002s)]
*  but it helps Netanyahu's career. So where are they gonna start this war? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2621.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, how many times have you heard that 263 Iranian civilians have been killed? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2625.26s)]
*  Oh, but they're just Muslim lives. My God, some kids were injured in this. Well, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2631.98s)]
*  that's terrible. I don't want any kids getting injured. 17,000 kids have been killed in Gaza. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2639.58s)]
*  17,000. How often do you hear that on American news? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2646.46s)]
*  You can, when an Israeli is victimized, that is headline news, gigantic news. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2653.5s)]
*  Palestinian and Iranians killed, who cares? They're just Muslim, right? Do we really have [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2660.94s)]
*  to pretend to care? No, apparently you don't. You don't have to pretend to care at all. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2665.7400000000002s)]
*  And this is not like, well, I mean, Iran had it coming. I know there's 263 of their civilians, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2669.58s)]
*  men, women, and children were killed by Israel. But hey, they had it coming because they started, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2674.86s)]
*  oh no, right, Israel started the war. But it doesn't matter. No sympathy for Muslims ever, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2679.7400000000002s)]
*  ever, ever. I don't know if Jake Tapper one day is gonna write a book. My God, we were all so [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2684.94s)]
*  incredibly bigoted against Muslims for our entire lives with every goddamn broadcast we ever did [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2690.3s)]
*  on cable news. Is that book coming, Jake? Okay, again, CBS News reports. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2697.1800000000003s)]
*  Israel is saying this was an 800 pound bomb. That's a giant bomb that dropped in the middle [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2703.1800000000003s)]
*  of the city. I condemn Iran for that. Israel's dropped countless 2,000 pound bombs, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2707.26s)]
*  one and a half times the size of the one that they dropped, that Iran dropped once. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2714.54s)]
*  And they're like, this is an outrage. But when you say that and you say it is not an outrage [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2719.26s)]
*  to drop endless 2,000 pound bombs in the middle of Palestinian cities, what you're saying is, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2725.1s)]
*  I don't care about Muslim lives at all. We're allowed to murder them as much as we like. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2734.62s)]
*  As much as we like. Okay, now you say, hey, Cenk, murder is a strong word. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2739.1s)]
*  You should reserve that only when Muslims do killings. Then it's murder and slaughter and [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2744.86s)]
*  terrorist and savage and dirty, right? When Israel does it, it was such an accident. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2749.8199999999997s)]
*  Was it? Because you just heard the stats that John read to you. 17 hospitals completely leveled by. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2755.5s)]
*  So did they miss over and over and over and over? Because you can't just [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2763.02s)]
*  destroy a hospital with one bomb. They had to level those hospitals. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2766.62s)]
*  They missed that many times. Are they the most incompetent military in the history of the world? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2771.1s)]
*  They accidentally destroyed or damaged 94% of the hospitals in Gaza. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2776.22s)]
*  Has there ever been a military that deeply incompetent? Of course not. No, whenever they [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2783.9s)]
*  want to, they could pick off any Iranian scientist, diplomat, politician, general. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2791.18s)]
*  They can kill all of Hezbollah at once. They can kill them anywhere they like. But did we accidentally [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2798.54s)]
*  bomb and destroy all of your hospitals? But you should feel tremendous sympathy for me [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2805.58s)]
*  because one bomb got dropped at an Israeli hospital and I do have sympathy for those people. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2813.02s)]
*  But then they demand that we have no sympathy for the tens of thousands that they murdered, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2819.42s)]
*  obviously on purpose. And now after being in the middle of this genocide, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2827.1800000000003s)]
*  they start a war with Iran. And then they say, but we've had some people injured. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2834.3s)]
*  So we demand the world's tears because we are the victims. Brothers and sisters, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2840.78s)]
*  those civilians who got hit in the hospital are victims. And your heart should break for them [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2846.22s)]
*  because they're normal, regular people. They're not politicians. They're not the leaders of that [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2851.1s)]
*  country. But when the Israeli government leaders tell me to have concerns for them, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2854.9399999999996s)]
*  that's preposterous. No, I have no sympathy for Netanyahu, Ben-Gavir, Smotrich, who are [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2862.4599999999996s)]
*  genocidal maniacs. It's like saying, some German civilians got killed. You have to have sympathy [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2868.54s)]
*  for Goebbels and Hitler. And no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't at all, zero. Did I just compare [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2874.22s)]
*  them? Yes, I did. If you don't want to be compared to them, maybe you shouldn't do a genocide. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2880.06s)]
*  Maybe you shouldn't start a war. I know, I know. Israel, special rules. They're allowed to murder, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2885.1s)]
*  genocide, attack, and we all have to bow our heads. No, I do not bow my head. Israel is 100% wrong [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2891.02s)]
*  for starting this war, 100%. And every Israeli civilian that gets killed is 100% the fault [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2898.86s)]
*  of Benjamin Netanyahu. Wait, if you say, that's not fair. You're blaming the victim. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2905.9s)]
*  Every time somebody said, hey, Israel's killing tens of thousands of kids here, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2911.98s)]
*  and innocent civilians, they said Hamas started it. It's all Hamas's fault. Okay, Israel started it. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2916.6200000000003s)]
*  So that means it is definitely Netanyahu's fault for every Israeli civilian killed. It was a [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2922.1400000000003s)]
*  terrorist Netanyahu that is the root cause of those deaths. That's Israeli logic. That is [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2927.58s)]
*  Netanyahu logic. And I know a lot of people will say yes, Cenk, but you're missing the central point. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2933.9s)]
*  Israeli lives are super precious and valuable, as all human lives should be. But Muslim lives are [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2941.18s)]
*  useless and are expendable. And you could just murder their children and the American press [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2947.66s)]
*  will pretend you're the victim. Go ahead, Trey. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2953.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know how much I can even add to it. I agree with you guys about taking the [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2955.74s)]
*  apparently sadly controversial to some American stance that bombing hospitals is always bad and [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2963.66s)]
*  should not happen. That's also how I feel about it. But yes, the main thing I saw when I saw the [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2970.22s)]
*  response, the main thing I thought when I saw the response to it from Israel and what Netanyahu said [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2975.1s)]
*  was just like, I mean, my God, the audacity, I can't imagine the shameless audacity of that. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2979.26s)]
*  It's like they say, Iran, they've crossed the line here. This is a war crime. And it's like, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2985.1000000000004s)]
*  y'all are the most habitually line crossing people in the war crime game. And everybody knows it. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2991.34s)]
*  What are you talking about? It reminds me of like, and obviously this is on a much, much lower scale, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=2999.26s)]
*  but it's the type of thing went over here when like how a lot of conservatives just when they [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3004.0600000000004s)]
*  talk about the left, they'll just gleefully bandy about like homophobic slurs, even racial slurs, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3008.7s)]
*  it calls like cucks and libtards and all that. And then in response, you're like, screw you fascist. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3014.06s)]
*  And they're like, oh, wow, name calling. Really? Okay. Okay. If you want to take it there. It's [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3019.1s)]
*  like that type of thing just makes you pull your hair out the hypocrisy of it all. But I mean, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3024.9399999999996s)]
*  Jack, I mean, you're right about everything you said about the assessment of it. It's like to some [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3030.14s)]
*  people and they wouldn't say it this exact way. Maybe although some of them might, but it's like [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3036.14s)]
*  internally, they're like, yeah, well, but see, but this is worse because these are like, see, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3042.06s)]
*  these are good people. They're on the side of the West. This is Israel. These are good people. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3046.2999999999997s)]
*  They're being killed. And then when they do it, those people are, well, you know what I mean? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3052.94s)]
*  They're just not as, and it's like, yes, they're poor, they're brown, they're Muslim, all that stuff [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3058.7s)]
*  that people just don't care about as much. And it's a shame, but I just don't know how Israel [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3064.14s)]
*  feels like they have a leg to stand on in this situation. Because the other thing, as you pointed [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3071.18s)]
*  out, also you started it. It wouldn't even have happened if you hadn't made the initial [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3075.2599999999998s)]
*  attack in the first place, which by the way, on that note, when that happened, I was like, my God, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3083.18s)]
*  do y'all not have enough on your plate already? I feel like you're not getting enough, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3086.62s)]
*  you know, your murder itch scratched enough or something. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3092.22s)]
*  Because I thought you guys were pretty busy. Now you're starting some stuff over here with these, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3095.58s)]
*  but you do that, they respond, and then you cry about it. I just, I don't have a lot of [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3099.8999999999996s)]
*  sympathy for them. I also have sympathy for the civilians, like you guys said, but Israel, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3105.1s)]
*  the entity and its leadership and all that, it's like, I'm just not trying to hear it really. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3110.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, okay, I can't help but add a couple things. First of all, Trey, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3115.2599999999998s)]
*  greater Israel isn't gonna build itself, okay? They gotta get better, right? And so [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3118.94s)]
*  those maps are in their cabinet room. They're not hiding the fact that these are aggressive [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3123.9s)]
*  imperial wars meant to seize Arab land. And if they have to kill a bunch of Arabs and Persians [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3129.9s)]
*  to do it, well, greater Israel's gotta get built. I mean, that is such an important, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3135.34s)]
*  important policy for America. Wait, what does America have to do with it? But no, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3140.46s)]
*  we have to fund all of it. Okay, Iran says the Israeli intelligence building was behind the [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3146.14s)]
*  hospital. John pointed out, it might have been like a mile behind the hospital. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3153.9s)]
*  So on the other hand, Israel said, we had to get hit, the first hospital they hit. They were like, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3157.34s)]
*  we had to, they got tunnels underneath. So they brought in Trey Yanks from Fox News. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3163.66s)]
*  And he looked and he's like, it's not underneath the hospital at all, it's all the way over there, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3168.06s)]
*  right? They said, nope, nope, it counts, it counts good enough. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3171.82s)]
*  Human shields, so it was okay that we murdered them, it's Hamas's fault. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3175.42s)]
*  Is Israel using human shields? I mean, that's not my logic, that's Israeli logic. They say, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3180.62s)]
*  if a military facility is anywhere near a hospital, you're allowed to murder everyone in the hospital. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3186.94s)]
*  That's not my logic, I hate that logic. But they say, I could destroy the whole hospital, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3194.38s)]
*  I could kill everyone in it. I could leave babies to die in that hospital, because hey, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3198.86s)]
*  there was a tunnel a whole couple of blocks away from the hospital. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3204.86s)]
*  It seems like the Iranian and Israeli logic match pretty well. Last piece of Israeli logic, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3210.46s)]
*  they say, no, we didn't kill any of the 56,000 people in Gaza. Hamas did, why? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3215.58s)]
*  Because they started the war. And if you start the war, then you're responsible for every single [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3223.42s)]
*  death, including on your side. Not my logic, that's Israel's logic. So since they 100% started this [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3228.46s)]
*  war, every death in Israel is on Netanyahu's head. And there's no question about that. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3235.7400000000002s)]
*  They can't say, well, they can't say, and they probably will say, well, yes, but you're right, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3241.9s)]
*  but I get it. But on the other hand, these are Israeli lives, so they're super important. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3246.78s)]
*  And those are Muslim lives. And we get to murder Muslims all we want, anti-Semite. Wait, wait, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3252.2999999999997s)]
*  wait, wait. You say you get to murder any Muslims you like. And then when we point out that fact, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3258.14s)]
*  then you say, it's anti-Semitic to point out that a government's leader has ordered the murder of [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3264.3799999999997s)]
*  over 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, and has destroyed all of their hospitals, has started a war, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3271.1s)]
*  and created a genocide. No, no, Netanyahu and everyone who supports him is deeply hateful, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3277.98s)]
*  racist bigots, okay? Two can play at that game, and we're actually [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3285.98s)]
*  accurate as opposed to the Israeli supporters. All right, we're gonna take a quick break. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3290.86s)]
*  We'll come right back. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3295.18s)]
*  All right, I wanna get angry, so apparently somebody, okay. The Transcendental Man wrote [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3337.98s)]
*  it on Super Chat. I'm reading this blind. It did not hit the hospital. It was damaged by the wave [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3351.9s)]
*  of the blast. If it hit the hospital, it would have been leveled. You're spreading propaganda [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3357.82s)]
*  for Israel by sharing this information. Do better. Look, brother, I've looked into it, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3361.82s)]
*  and to me, it is not at all clear. The Iranians say it didn't hit the hospital, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3365.9s)]
*  just the shock waves. The Israelis say it did hit the hospital. They're both giant liars, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3369.82s)]
*  so it's impossible to know what actually happened. At least for now, without better reporting, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3375.02s)]
*  that's my sense of what I have read. And by the way, if you hit near a hospital and the shock waves [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3379.26s)]
*  injure or hurt people in the hospital, that's still terrible, right? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3385.42s)]
*  And that's why it's also terrible that Israel has damaged or destroyed [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3389.6600000000003s)]
*  94% of the hospitals in Gaza. So let's have the same standard for everyone, okay? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3393.58s)]
*  So now let's go to our members on tyt.com. Burrito Bandito said, so the Trump apocalypse starts [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3399.9s)]
*  on July 4th. Well, look, they're gonna do a war power resolutions vote probably next week. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3406.94s)]
*  Then Trump says he's gonna decide by around July 3rd. So yeah, on Independence Day, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3411.9s)]
*  we might start a giant war for Israel to celebrate American independence. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3417.26s)]
*  I think the next round of the no-kings protests of that day too, I think. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3423.5s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3426.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3426.86s)]
*  That's a good day then, okay. Yeah, I would love to be independent of Israel. And if you say that, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3427.42s)]
*  oh no, no, no, Israel has no effect on US policy, you're a hilarious joke. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3432.38s)]
*  Like maybe the dumbest person in America or a mainstream media reporter. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3439.34s)]
*  Bloated Ego says Israel's committing the genocide, but the US is funding it. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3443.42s)]
*  So isn't the US guilty of war crimes by association? Should no warrant on the US be issued? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3447.34s)]
*  Brother, don't go there. Here's why I say that. Look, maybe one day we'll get judged on that as [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3451.7400000000002s)]
*  a country and we probably should, not probably we should. I mean, but it was our politicians, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3456.62s)]
*  we didn't do it, we didn't do it. It's our corrupt, crook politicians that have taken [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3460.62s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars from AIPAC to totally and utterly serve Israel. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3465.9s)]
*  If you don't realize they think, no, they took the hundreds of millions of dollars to serve Norway, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3470.62s)]
*  to serve China, no, it's to serve Israel. If you're saying that that's not true, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3475.98s)]
*  you're an idiot of the greatest proportions. I'm not talking to the member, I'm talking to [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3479.98s)]
*  Israeli supporters. Anyway, but the reason why I say don't go in the direction of blaming America, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3484.62s)]
*  we need the American people on our side. So we need all of them on our side. We need left, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3489.2599999999998s)]
*  libertarians right to stop this war. So this is not the time in my opinion, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3494.8599999999997s)]
*  strategically. Nonny Dragon says even John Stewart was praising Tucker for his interview. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3499.5s)]
*  Well, it's impossible not to. I mean, that evisceration of Ted Cruz was delightful to see. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3503.98s)]
*  Mamatit222 said, I've seen this statement from Bibi on several news outlets. But besides TYT, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3509.26s)]
*  the only one that ever mentioned the destruction of health facilities in Gaza was Democracy Now. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3514.78s)]
*  Amy Goodman is a national treasure. And it's not a coincidence that Democracy Now and the Young [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3519.34s)]
*  Turks were the only two national shows that said don't go into Iraq. And now we're the only ones [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3526.78s)]
*  that are showing you the true face of Israel and their war crimes. Now, you know why? Because we're [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3533.1800000000003s)]
*  the two honest shows, Young Turks. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3538.3s)]
*  All right, back on TYT. I just gotta read two quick comments. Suspal writes in [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3556.78s)]
*  at tyt.com member section. Trey is so great. I saw him live last year and he stayed and [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3571.42s)]
*  took pictures with everybody one by one and was kind and gracious. Also hilarious. I'd see him [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3575.9s)]
*  anytime he's in KC. So Trey, how can people catch you? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3581.26s)]
*  You go to Trey Crowder, traecrowder.com to check out my tour dates. Also Trey Crowder on any social [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3585.98s)]
*  media platform. KC, just for the record, I'll be there again in July, next month, July 25th or 26th, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3591.5s)]
*  something like that. But I'm going all over the place always. Yeah, just Trey Crowder on [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3596.86s)]
*  your preferred platform, tracrowder.com and that'll do it. All right, great. And lastly, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3601.7400000000002s)]
*  during the break, I read a super chat from Transcendental Man who was challenging us [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3607.8199999999997s)]
*  with a little bit of critique. He wrote back in, thank you, Cenk. I appreciate this response. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3611.8199999999997s)]
*  I love that, brother. Way to have an open mind. Okay, John. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3615.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay, let's end the first hour with a little bit of good news or at least a good development. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3619.18s)]
*  Federal judge earlier today ordered the US government to finally free former Columbia [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3624.7799999999997s)]
*  University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil from the Immigrant Detention Center where he's been [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3629.58s)]
*  held since early March. This is US District Judge Michael Farbyars who said it was highly, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3634.22s)]
*  highly unusual for the government to continue to detain a legal US resident who was unlikely to [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3640.14s)]
*  flee and hadn't been accused of any violence. He said Khalil is likely not a flight risk and [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3645.58s)]
*  quote is not a danger to the community, period, full stop. And to be clear, he has not just not [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3650.22s)]
*  been accused of any violence. He hasn't been accused of any crimes. The official line from [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3656.3799999999997s)]
*  the government is they find the positions he has on the genocide so distasteful that he has to be [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3661.66s)]
*  locked up for months. He has been locked up in jail for almost four months because Trump doesn't [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3670.22s)]
*  like his position on the war. That's it. His positions are so crucially politically incorrect [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3676.62s)]
*  that he had to be locked up and kept away from the public because he might infect them with his [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3684.2999999999997s)]
*  anti-war positions. In any event, this comes after several other scholars have been targeted [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3688.06s)]
*  for their activism. They've also been released but earlier than Mahmoud Khalil, who was the first [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3693.9s)]
*  who was seized during this spate of censorship. You have a former Palestinian student at Columbia, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3699.2599999999998s)]
*  Mohsen Mahdawi, Tufts University student Ramesa Aztariq and a Georgetown University scholar [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3705.18s)]
*  Bader Khan Suri, who all were detained and all were ordered to be released. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3710.62s)]
*  And obviously Khalil finally being released was seen as good news by his wife who has been [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3716.54s)]
*  away from her partner for a third of a year now for absolutely nothing. She says, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3723.66s)]
*  we know this ruling does not begin to address the injustices the Trump administration has brought [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3729.9s)]
*  upon our family and so many others. But today we are celebrating Mahmoud coming back to New York [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3735.66s)]
*  to be reunited with our little family. And that is good news. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3740.7799999999997s)]
*  Assuming the Trump administration actually abides by the ruling, we'll have to see. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3744.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, John, the only bone I have to pick with you is your headline was a little wrong. It's [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3749.66s)]
*  Israeli hostage released inside America. So it was donors who want America to serve Israel [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3755.8199999999997s)]
*  that ordered the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil. There's no other reason to arrest him. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3764.22s)]
*  And this judge, by the way, if you think, by his liberal judge, no, he's the one that said it in [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3768.3799999999997s)]
*  the first round. No, they have a right to detain him and deport him if they can prove their case. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3773.02s)]
*  So at the time people are like, maybe he's a pro-Trump judge, right? No, he's like, no, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3778.54s)]
*  you gotta show me the evidence. So they bring him in. And he's like, okay, give me evidence of [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3782.3799999999997s)]
*  any violent act he did. We don't have any. Okay, how about property destruction? We don't have any. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3786.7s)]
*  Okay, how about any crime? We don't have any. So then why the hell did you arrest them? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3792.9399999999996s)]
*  And they're like, it could be that maybe there was a problem in his visa. Yeah, but what do you mean [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3799.4199999999996s)]
*  maybe there was a problem in his visa? Is there a problem in his visa? We're not gonna present [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3805.3399999999997s)]
*  any evidence. It's like, well, then yeah, if you arrest the guy for absolutely no reason, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3809.8999999999996s)]
*  yes, you have to release him. That's our laws in America. It's not complicated. This is like [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3816.54s)]
*  the easiest case he's ever had to deal with. When the government presents zero evidence of any crime, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3820.94s)]
*  no, you can't keep him. But the government says, but to be fair, he has criticized beloved Israel. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3828.06s)]
*  And remember when we burned our constitution and got rid of the First Amendment or actually [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3833.7400000000002s)]
*  just crossed it out. You have freedom of speech unless you criticize Israel, in which case you'll [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3839.1s)]
*  be locked up because AIPAC gave hundreds of millions of dollars to our Congress people [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3844.2200000000003s)]
*  and to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3848.7s)]
*  But to be fair to Biden, he didn't do this and he wouldn't as terrible as Biden was, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3852.7799999999997s)]
*  as he was an enabler of genocide and paid for a genocide. He didn't go the extra mile of saying, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3857.1s)]
*  I'll end freedom of speech in America on behalf of Israel. That was Donald Trump. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3863.98s)]
*  So thank God for the American court system. Thank God we're a democracy and a constitutional [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3868.94s)]
*  republic. So the judge said, no, you have to let that Israeli hostage go. He didn't do anything [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3873.3399999999997s)]
*  wrong. And yes, he does have freedom of speech in America. Trey? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3878.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this, at least he finally is getting out. But the fact that this can happen [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3882.46s)]
*  and can last this long, I mean, he spent months in there for literally nothing. It should be [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3889.5s)]
*  alarming to everybody. I mean, I get cheeky sometimes and joke about it. I'm like, yeah, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3893.26s)]
*  I'm gonna end up in the gulag one day if this keeps up or whatever. And it's like, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3897.9s)]
*  obviously it's a little different. I'm a white guy from Tennessee, but still, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3901.9s)]
*  they really have ripped up the Constitution to make political prisoners out of people who say [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3906.94s)]
*  things that they don't like. And there's people, I guarantee there's plenty of people who would [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3911.02s)]
*  tell you they are in part Trump supporters because you know what? They're free speech [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3917.18s)]
*  absolutists. That whole argument who yet will twist themselves into knots trying to justify [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3921.34s)]
*  this or just ignoring it and pretending it doesn't happen. But this is like, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3926.54s)]
*  this type of thing is scary. It's the type of thing you would hope wouldn't be imaginable [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3931.02s)]
*  in this country if it actually worked the way it purports to and clearly it doesn't, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3938.2200000000003s)]
*  and in particular under this regime. So again, ultimately, at least so far, unless they just [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3944.06s)]
*  decide to ignore this or do something even worse, seems like the right thing happened at the end of [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3950.6200000000003s)]
*  the day at least, but it took way too long and should have never even needed to happen in the [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3955.9s)]
*  first place. So it's bad. Yeah, and Mahmoud Khalil and his family should sue this government of [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3962.14s)]
*  Israel. Yes. You're allowed to sue terrorist organizations to get compensation. And Israel, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3968.3s)]
*  having destroyed almost every hospital in Gaza, having destroyed almost everything in Gaza, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3975.5s)]
*  having murdered over 50,000 people, having murdered over 17,000 kids is obviously a [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3979.6600000000003s)]
*  terrorist state. And they have intentionally murdered those people and we've shown it a time [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3985.02s)]
*  again and again and again. And now they're coming to kidnap people on our streets through our corrupt [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3990.86s)]
*  dirtbag politicians. And so Trump should be sued. And if you're MAGA, you're like, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=3996.62s)]
*  yeah, I'm a free speech absolutist like Trey said, but he's an immigrant. I hate immigrants. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4002.54s)]
*  So let's just get rid of our freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is for America, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4007.74s)]
*  everyone in America. The Supreme Court has ruled out for 200 years straight. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4011.98s)]
*  If you let Israel kill freedom of speech for people who are here legally, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4016.3s)]
*  that means you're killing it for US citizens. Even if you don't care about immigrants, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4021.34s)]
*  that means you're killing it for US citizens on behalf of a foreign government. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4026.94s)]
*  Okay, now if you don't get that and you say no, he shouldn't be allowed to criticize Israel. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4032.3s)]
*  No, Israel should rule us and Israel should be allowed to kidnap anyone they like off an [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4037.18s)]
*  American street for criticizing beloved Israel. You criticizing a genocide? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4041.42s)]
*  It's like the Germans having us arrest people who are opposed to the Holocaust [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4047.58s)]
*  here in America. He criticized the German government. He criticized the German government. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4051.9s)]
*  He has no business here. Lock him up. But did he do anything wrong? No, but he criticized the [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4056.54s)]
*  Germans. I mean, all they're doing is a Holocaust. My God, are you offended? Are you offended? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4061.5s)]
*  I'm 10,000 times more offended at the 17,000 dead Palestinian kids. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4067.5s)]
*  But no, I know, mustering up. No, I care. I care about the Palestinians who died. I care. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4073.98s)]
*  I mean, I don't care as much as you offending me. Your words are problematic. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4079.7400000000002s)]
*  Let's lock him up. Let's lock him up. Let's go. Let's go. Israel, take more hostages in America. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4084.2200000000003s)]
*  And thank God the courts are stopping it. And so Trump's total and utter joke on freedom of speech [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4089.82s)]
*  and America first. That guy didn't even criticize America. And by the way, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4096.06s)]
*  no one's gotten arrested for criticizing America. You can criticize America all day, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4100.3s)]
*  all night, as by the way you should be allowed to, freedom of speech. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4105.1s)]
*  But you criticize Israel, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble in this country. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4108.14s)]
*  This is insanity. My family moved here. We didn't move to Israel. We moved here [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4112.700000000001s)]
*  because we love America. If we knew that it was gonna be controlled by Israel, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4121.26s)]
*  I don't know that we, are we telling everybody that this is America, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4127.26s)]
*  but our politicians all work for Israel? God damn it, man. If you're America first, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4131.42s)]
*  you should hate this more than anyone else. For God's sake, man, kidnapping people off the streets [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4136.7s)]
*  for criticizing a foreign government. Imagine if we did this for any other country. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4143.66s)]
*  That guy criticized Saudi Arabia. I mean, Saudi Arabia chopped up an American journalist, right? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4149.02s)]
*  That's it. Saudi Arabia is now giving money to Trump or Biden or whoever, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4156.38s)]
*  and to all our corrupt crooks like Ted Cruz, etc. That's it, round up all the Saudi critics. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4159.900000000001s)]
*  You say that's insanity. Are you crazy? We're gonna round up the Saudi critics? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4165.1s)]
*  And you wouldn't say, well, he's an immigrant. He's a legal resident here, but he's an immigrant. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4168.3s)]
*  So let's make sure we lock him, take him hostage for Saudi Arabia. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4172.38s)]
*  Nobody would say that. Why are we having a conversation about it with Israel? Can we please [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4175.82s)]
*  stop following the orders of Israel? Is that too much to ask for? And if you say they're not [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4179.98s)]
*  giving us orders, you're hilarious. Hilarious. No, I know this guy was attacking Norway, right? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4187.179999999999s)]
*  It was about healthcare? It was about Peru? What was it about? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4195.42s)]
*  Harsh words for Switzerland. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4200.62s)]
*  Yeah, why did Eustor get arrested? She wrote an op-ed against who? Against who? Israel. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4202.7s)]
*  But don't say Israel. Don't say Israel. I'm saying it. They pay our politicians, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4209.9s)]
*  our politicians are crooks, and work for a foreign government. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4216.22s)]
*  I think [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4261.1s)]
*  what the audience also appreciates is if they're, especially if they're members, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4286.46s)]
*  they really get an inside look into who we are, our personal lives, what drives and motivates us. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4291.5s)]
*  It goes beyond just storytelling. I think that what we do is allow our viewers and our listeners [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4298.46s)]
*  into our daily lives, and we give them kind of like this inside look into everything that [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4306.14s)]
*  we're passionate about and why it is that we're doing what we're doing, right? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4311.74s)]
*  The motivation behind what we're doing I think is important for our audience to know, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4315.66s)]
*  and we're not shy about sharing that with them. And it's different from what people typically see [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4320.38s)]
*  in legacy media outlets, where everything is kind of dry and robotic and there's really no [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4325.9s)]
*  personality or authenticity that comes along with it. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4331.42s)]
*  Oftentimes when we're doing the show, I don't really think of it as me telling them stories. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4334.0599999999995s)]
*  I think of it as us having a mutual respect and conversation with one another. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4339.18s)]
*  And as I said earlier, I mean, not only do I feel that through the work I do, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4344.700000000001s)]
*  I'm informing our audience, but they inform me oftentimes as well. They'll pitch stories to us. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4349.1s)]
*  They'll tell us a certain perspective or angle to a story that we might have missed, and I love it. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4355.1s)]
*  Remember, go to tyt.com slash join, you'll get all the behind the scenes of me, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4369.18s)]

*  is the MAGA movement making up and reuniting? We still have questions. Tucker Carlson, you might [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4622.54s)]
*  recall, hit hard at Trump throughout the week and made claims that this potential war was not, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4628.379999999999s)]
*  quote, America first. Additionally, earlier this week, Tucker Carlson gave Senator Ted Cruz a [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4633.339999999999s)]
*  thorough dressing down in a brutal interview about going to war with Iran. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4639.9s)]
*  But now Donald Trump is saying that Tucker Carlson gave him a call to apologize for being too harsh. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4644.94s)]
*  Cenk, what do you think about this call? Do you believe this report? And what do you think [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4651.58s)]
*  Tucker actually said? Do you think he apologized? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4656.54s)]
*  A, of course, we don't know. B, my guess is yes. And I'll tell you why. I think that [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4660.78s)]
*  both Tucker and Bannon, as you'll see in a minute, are playing a game of trying to win [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4667.9s)]
*  Donald Trump over to their side. And they know that if you cater to his ego, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4674.94s)]
*  I hope I didn't cross a line, beloved Mr. President. And you're so amazing and heroic [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4680.78s)]
*  and wonderful. And I'm nothing but your lowly servant. But could you please not attack Iran [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4687.339999999999s)]
*  because we kind of said anti-war? That's my best guess, but I don't know. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4693.58s)]
*  And whether, okay, but I do know this. I'm more confident that Tucker Carlson is actually anti-war, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4698.46s)]
*  that he didn't go and say, I apologize, I think you should attack Iran. No, that I would be shocked by. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4708.86s)]
*  Yeah, let's get into more. For a refresher, this is what Tucker posted on X just a few days ago. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4714.54s)]
*  The real divide isn't between people who support Israel and people who support Iran or the [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4722.94s)]
*  Palestinians. The real divide is between those who casually encourage violence and those who seek [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4727.5s)]
*  to prevent it, between warmongers and peacemakers. Who are the warmongers? They would include anyone [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4733.02s)]
*  who's calling Donald Trump today to demand airstrikes and other direct US military [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4739.74s)]
*  involvement in a war with Iran. On that list, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Rupert Murdoch, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4744.54s)]
*  Ike Perlmutter, and Miriam Adelson. At some point, they will all have to answer for this, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4751.82s)]
*  but you should know their names now, to which Trump responded calling him Kuki Carlson. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4758.62s)]
*  Posting on Truth Social, somebody please explain to Kuki Tucker Carlson that Iran [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4765.099999999999s)]
*  cannot have a nuclear weapon. Now, let's hear more from Trump on this alleged apology call from Tucker. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4771.9s)]
*  Take a look. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4779.66s)]
*  I've seen the Tucker Carlson and Senator Ted Cruz interview. It seems like this issue on whether [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4780.22s)]
*  or not the United States should strike is kind of dividing a lot of your supporters. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4785.18s)]
*  No, my supporters are for me. My supporters are America first, they make America great again. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4790.78s)]
*  My supporters don't want to see Iran have a nuclear weapon. Tucker's a nice guy. He called [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4796.78s)]
*  and apologized the other day because he thought he said things that were a little bit too strong. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4802.22s)]
*  And I appreciated that. And Ted Cruz is a nice guy. I mean, he's been with me for a long time. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4807.820000000001s)]
*  I'd say once the race was over, he's been with me ever since, right? But very simple. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4812.62s)]
*  If they think that it's okay for Iran to have a nuclear weapon, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4819.9800000000005s)]
*  then they should oppose me, but nobody thinks it's okay. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4824.14s)]
*  Now, it seems that some of MAGA may be softening their tone and suggesting that they will [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4829.1s)]
*  ultimately support the president if he decides to join Israel in its strikes against Iran. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4833.82s)]
*  Steve Bannon was one of the voices earlier this week warning that attacking Iran would split the [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4839.5s)]
*  country in half. Now Bannon is saying that MAGA will trust whatever decision that Trump ultimately [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4844.299999999999s)]
*  makes. Here is Bannon speaking to reporters at a Christian Science Monitor event on Wednesday. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4850.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4856.219999999999s)]
*  This is why I think if President Trump decides there's not a diplomatic alternative or an [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4857.42s)]
*  economic warfare alternative that he feels, particularly with the nuclear situation, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4863.42s)]
*  the fedor, that he feels that he has to do it in the best interest to do it [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4867.26s)]
*  because he's been consistent. No nuclear weapon, and we've said that too. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4871.66s)]
*  We've said that too. No, they cannot have, they're not trustworthy enough to have a nuke. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4875.9s)]
*  President Trump decides to do that. I know, and particularly his skills as a communicator, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4880.46s)]
*  that he will come and walk people through it. And the MAGA movement, look, there'll be some, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4886.46s)]
*  but the vast majority of the MAGA movement go, look, we trust your judgment. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4890.62s)]
*  You've walked us through this. We don't like it. In fact, maybe we hate it, but we'll get on board. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4894.38s)]
*  Not to be outdone, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X her support of the president. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4903.82s)]
*  I'm so glad President Trump is giving time for diplomacy to work with Iran and Israel. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4911.26s)]
*  Every other American president would be dropping bombs already, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4916.0599999999995s)]
*  killing many innocent people. And the neo con warmongers would be celebrating without [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4919.179999999999s)]
*  a care of innocent lives slaughtered. This is why he has a 56% approval rating. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4924.54s)]
*  I'm praying for peace and prosperity for Israel and Iran and every nation on earth, especially the [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4930.86s)]
*  USA. Alex Jones was equally complimentary of Trump, but still made a quote, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4937.02s)]
*  direct emergency warning to him while on a show with Steve Bannon. Take a look. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4942.700000000001s)]
*  If you walked into the Oval Office this morning, Alex Jones and had five minutes with the [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4949.580000000001s)]
*  commander in chief, go ahead and roll. Tell me what Alex Jones tells him right now. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4954.540000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, I absolutely agree with you that the Mullahs want to destroy Israel and that they're [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4958.54s)]
*  unpopular and that they are a serious danger to world peace. I'm not gonna tell you what I [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4968.46s)]
*  think you should do. I would just ask you to please take your time on this, sir, and not be [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4973.18s)]
*  stampeded into anything that could potentially not just derail your agenda to save America and [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4978.14s)]
*  the West and the world, but could trigger the end of the world as we know it. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4983.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, some concerning new polling indicates that Republicans are in favor [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4988.54s)]
*  of strikes on Iran and will back Trump over his dissenters. Take a look. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4994.38s)]
*  The clear majority of Republicans in any poll that you look, GOP on US airstrikes against Iran, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=4999.58s)]
*  if Iran's pursuing nuclear arms, you see it here. The Republican Party, again, is with Donald Trump, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5006.46s)]
*  69% in this particular poll from the Chicago Council that was taken a few months ago compared [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5011.26s)]
*  to 27% who are opposed. But again, even if you look at the other polling data at all points in [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5015.74s)]
*  the same direction, Republicans are with Donald Trump on this particular issue and they're with [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5021.5s)]
*  Donald Trump at large. And when you go against Donald Trump, you go down. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5025.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's just one poll. On the other hand, some polls reflect very different [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5028.46s)]
*  findings. For instance, this YouGov poll found that 16% of US adults believe the US [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5035.26s)]
*  military should not get involved with Iran. The economist YouGov poll we talked about earlier [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5044.86s)]
*  this week found that only 23% of Republicans said we should get involved in the war, 53% said no. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5051.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, Steve Bannon is going so far as to call for an investigation into various [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5059.58s)]
*  Fox News personalities, including Kayleigh McEnany, Sean Hannity, and Mark Levin, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5064.139999999999s)]
*  who are supposedly quote, representing Israel. Take a look. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5069.74s)]
*  It's almost criminal, criminal what is going on. In fact, I think an investigation into like, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5073.42s)]
*  what is the information Fox News is getting? Is money trading hands? Are they getting ads? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5081.98s)]
*  I mean, I would actually say a farra investigation should take place of Fox News and it should take [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5088.7s)]
*  place of Fox News like starting today. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5095.5s)]
*  So there's a lot to consider here, Cenk. Do you think that the MAGA base is getting behind this [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5098.62s)]
*  idea of direct strikes, US strikes on Iran? No, not at all. That's, hey, Sharon. That's the- [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5107.34s)]
*  Hey. Hi, Cenk. Hi, Jordan. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5116.22s)]
*  Hey. Hello. So if that's the first time I've seen Harry Antin be dishonest, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5118.54s)]
*  because- Wow. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5125.26s)]
*  Yeah, I've given him a lot of credit. He's pointed out issues with both sides. He's been [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5126.3s)]
*  honest about the problems with the Democratic Party, Republican Party, etc. And when they do [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5132.14s)]
*  well. But he said he looked at all the polls. No, that's not true at all. So we just showed you, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5136.14s)]
*  you got a poll and Republican voters in that poll are overwhelmingly against the war. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5141.820000000001s)]
*  And his framing of that segment was, you better not oppose Donald Trump and the [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5147.1s)]
*  Republican Party, okay? So if he's saying war, you gotta say war. And I'll cherry pick one poll [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5152.14s)]
*  that I don't believe that poll at all. It doesn't match any of the other polls I've seen, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5157.5s)]
*  okay? And then Harry Antin says that one poll represents all the other polls. That's just not [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5161.5s)]
*  true. So I don't know why he said that, but his cable news in favor of war, always, always. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5165.740000000001s)]
*  So that was super disappointing. I'd like to see him show all the polls, because I just don't [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5172.06s)]
*  believe him. Not I don't believe him. It's a fact that it's not true. Not only, look, you get the [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5180.14s)]
*  real official polls like you go. And then there's the non-official polls. I know he's not gonna [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5185.740000000001s)]
*  quote those. So this is less about Antin in that case. But Charlie Kirk pulled his own audience. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5189.02s)]
*  90% said don't go to war. Only 10% said yes. Why do you think Charlie Kirk is even slightly [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5193.58s)]
*  dancing around the edges of criticizing Trump's actions here? I mean, Charlie Kirk has actually [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5199.740000000001s)]
*  been a giant ask-historist of Israel his whole career. So why is he like, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5204.86s)]
*  tepidly saying, well, maybe we shouldn't, but I'm sorry, Donald knows everything, right? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5209.259999999999s)]
*  Because his own audience is like, no, no, no, we don't wanna go to war. 90-10, what part of that [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5213.5s)]
*  is complicated? So there's the whole Republican Party in 90-10? No, it's complicated. There's the [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5219.099999999999s)]
*  old boomers who watch cable news and Fox News, and they're like, yeah, as war is always great, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5226.299999999999s)]
*  we're gonna do Iraq again. Glory days. And then there's tons of mago who are totally against it. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5231.42s)]
*  And there's tons of people that are Trump supporters that are in the middle and don't know [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5237.82s)]
*  what to do. Partly because they think, my God, Trump is amazing and he knows what he's doing. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5241.34s)]
*  And if he says we're gonna stop their nukes, but Trump's lying to you. They don't have nukes. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5246.3s)]
*  They don't have close to having nukes. Now, why can I say that, but Bannon and Tucker and all of [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5250.46s)]
*  them are all tiptoeing, tiptoeing, tiptoeing? Because, okay, so let's be clear, there's two [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5256.14s)]
*  possibilities. And I don't know which one it is, but I have a guess and I'm curious what your [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5262.54s)]
*  guys' guess is. One possibility is, yeah, they've tried to stop the war for whatever reason. They [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5266.46s)]
*  thought their audience is against the war, etc. But then now that they haven't, they're just [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5273.1s)]
*  cowards and they're just back to licking Trump's boots. The second potential reason is, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5278.3s)]
*  if you attack Trump on this, he'll dig in and then we'll definitely have war. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5283.660000000001s)]
*  So both of those things could be true. I think Tucker Carlson is definitely against the war. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5289.34s)]
*  I think Bannon has gotten pushed there, certainly by his audience. Charlie Kirk is not there at all [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5296.06s)]
*  yet, but is being pushed aggressively by his audience. Marjorie Taylor Greene with her voters, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5301.5s)]
*  etc. And so again, I wonder what you guys think. But here's how we'll know for sure. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5306.78s)]
*  This is speculation in this round. But if going forward, Bannon and Tucker and all those guys [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5316.0599999999995s)]
*  continue to hit the neocons and the establishment and their proxies by saying things like Fox News [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5323.099999999999s)]
*  hosts should be investigated for supporting a foreign government of Israel, like Bannon just [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5332.22s)]
*  said. That means they are anti-war. They're trying to ingratiate themselves to Donald Trump [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5337.66s)]
*  so that they don't alienate him and that he actually comes out on their side and they [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5343.02s)]
*  wouldn't get us in the neocons. If it turns out Bannon and Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5347.34s)]
*  etc. from now on, just go, Trump is right, the war is great, we understand. He made a case where [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5352.06s)]
*  they can't have nuclear weapons and they become pro-war. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5357.18s)]
*  Then there's no hope for redemption for them on any issue for the rest of their lives. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5362.06s)]
*  Because then that means they were the biggest frauds that anybody has ever seen. And we're [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5367.34s)]
*  not gonna be overly surprised by that, but it hasn't happened yet. There's no question that they [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5371.58s)]
*  all have said a thousand times that they're against war. If they turn around just to lick [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5377.34s)]
*  Donald Trump's boots, then you'll know exactly what their character is. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5382.22s)]
*  Okay, Sharon, what do you think's happening here? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5386.860000000001s)]
*  Well, I think part of the problem is when you dance in an untruthful space for so long, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5389.34s)]
*  I don't know. It's probably the second one. Tucker does not want war, perhaps Marjorie doesn't, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5395.18s)]
*  but I think Tucker, Bannon, Marjorie Taylor Greene can all be bought. So I just, I don't know. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5402.46s)]
*  I really just don't know. The other part of it is, listen, this is the guy who is at the top, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5409.26s)]
*  and so you have to play to his personality, play his game. But it's a little bit like a toddler who [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5418.7s)]
*  never picks up their toys and they pick up one toy and you have to give them heaps of praise [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5425.5s)]
*  and say, you're the world's greatest cleaner. Just to kind of mess with their heads and get [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5430.38s)]
*  them to pick up more. That's like who Donald Trump is, but it's just like a nutty space to me. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5436.86s)]
*  I don't know who Tucker is. Maybe he's often different, I don't know, since the firing from [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5443.58s)]
*  the Fox News channel, or maybe he's up to something. I don't know, and I didn't answer [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5451.0199999999995s)]
*  your question, Cenk, but it's just hard to tell when people move in spaces that I think [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5457.42s)]
*  have lacked integrity for a high percentage of time. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5463.66s)]
*  Yeah, just one quick thing before we go to Jordan. He doesn't have to have softened at all. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5467.5s)]
*  He could be strategizing, hey, if I'm anti-war, and to be fair to Tucker Carlson, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5473.58s)]
*  he's had an anti-war position now for a number of years, right? He was for the Iraq War originally, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5479.9s)]
*  then he apologized for that and turned against it. He's been anti-war throughout, but it could [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5486.0599999999995s)]
*  all just so be strategic. If he's gonna run in 2028, and he thinks most of the magas anti-war, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5491.5s)]
*  now he'll get to say, I told you not to go into Iran, and remember all the other Republicans who [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5498.94s)]
*  said to go into Iran, so I'm the only one you could vote for. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5505.34s)]
*  And that would actually be well played strategically on the Republican side. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5508.94s)]
*  Jordan, what do you think? Yeah, I wanna point out something about the methodology in both of [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5512.86s)]
*  these polls. I wouldn't say that the one CNN cited was fake, per se. It did seem to have a misleading [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5518.38s)]
*  premise, which would goad more respondents into a certain answer. If you notice [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5527.82s)]
*  what Harry Enton was saying, it was if Iran is pursuing or working toward, I can't remember [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5534.14s)]
*  the exact language, a nuclear weapon, they're trying to develop nuclear arms, more people [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5541.58s)]
*  then, yes, supported a strike. If you look at the YouGov poll, it's just a straightforward, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5547.5s)]
*  should the US get involved. So when you lay that out across the board, you do find more Americans [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5552.94s)]
*  who are opposed to Iran having nuclear weapons. But what's important to drive home, and most [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5559.42s)]
*  mainstream coverage, and certainly Hawks will never mention this, US intelligence found earlier [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5565.74s)]
*  this year, and of course, Tulsi Gabbard mentioned it in her confirmation hearing. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5571.9s)]
*  But separately, US intelligence found that Iran had not restarted its nuclear program. They are [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5576.62s)]
*  at least years away from developing a nuclear weapon if they were to pursue the development [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5584.0599999999995s)]
*  of a nuclear weapon. So to ask respondents about a current active situation in the Middle East [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5591.0199999999995s)]
*  right now under a false premise is deeply, deeply irresponsible and elicits more hawkish responses [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5598.78s)]
*  from those poll respondents. Yeah, I have a couple more points. First of all, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5606.22s)]
*  that's a terrific point by Jordan about that poll that CNN featured. Because it's a giant [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5610.22s)]
*  false premise. It's the exact kind of false premises that CNN did to drive us into the Iraq war. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5616.06s)]
*  Well, if Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, but they didn't. Every time you said if, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5623.9800000000005s)]
*  people made it seem like they do have weapons of mass destruction, Iran does have nukes. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5630.38s)]
*  But Iran doesn't have nukes, and our own intelligence has confirmed that they don't [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5634.46s)]
*  have nukes and they're not anywhere near having nukes. In fact, they don't even have a nuclear [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5638.94s)]
*  weapons program, according to Tulsi Gabbard, at least when she was being honest in congressional [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5642.62s)]
*  hearings before her latest twist into more groveling and ass kissing of Trump, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5647.18s)]
*  which we reported on earlier in this show. So when they frame it that way, it's like framing [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5652.22s)]
*  it like this. If Iran is going to kill your mother, should we do something about it? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5657.1s)]
*  Well, yeah, if they're gonna kill my mom, we should do something about it. But there's no [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5660.62s)]
*  evidence that they are gonna kill my mom. Nope, nope, you said yes, that's it, everybody wants [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5665.82s)]
*  to attack Iran. So that's garbage CNN driving us to war as usual. Anyway, so if you're wondering, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5669.9s)]
*  yeah, but which side is MAGA on? There's this ludicrous theory on some portions of the left [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5677.5s)]
*  that all of MAGA is actually pro-war and they're lying about being anti-war. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5683.82s)]
*  But guys, there's reasons for politicians to lie about their position, even reasons why media might [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5690.219999999999s)]
*  lie about their position. But why would a MAGA guy lie about his own position? Some of their [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5696.0599999999995s)]
*  positions are heinous and they don't lie about those, just say it to you, right? Like, yeah, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5702.7s)]
*  we think Abrego Garcia wasn't guilty, and Mahmoud Alil wasn't guilty, so what? Lock him up, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5708.7s)]
*  they're immigrants. They don't hide any of their opinions, they have no reason to hide any of their [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5713.42s)]
*  opinions. And why do you think Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, etc., or all of them are pushing [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5717.82s)]
*  towards anti-war? Cuz their voters, their audience is pushing towards anti-war. And so how can you [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5722.86s)]
*  tell? You could tell in what is said between the lines. So Alex Joseph then he's like, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5728.7s)]
*  well, the president should do whatever he thinks is right, he's such an amazing guy. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5734.3s)]
*  And so if he attacks Iran though, of course, the whole world might die. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5738.46s)]
*  That's Alex Jones saying, don't attack Iran, but I'm kissing your ass so you don't hate me, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5743.34s)]
*  so you don't dig in further. And even in the grumbling one that Bannon did and the one that [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5748.22s)]
*  we showed you, and he said, and if he says we should go to war, he could make a good case for [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5753.42s)]
*  it, I'm sure, even if we hate it, right? But you could say, no, they're all lying, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5758.38s)]
*  and that this is all a giant trick, etc. But none of that matters. The only guy making the decision [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5765.9800000000005s)]
*  is Trump. So let's hope to God that I'm right at least about some significant portion of the [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5770.46s)]
*  MAGA base. And that they actually make a push here, because the only people who could beat the [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5777.34s)]
*  neocons within these two weeks that Trump is deciding, this is another comical point that some [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5783.66s)]
*  on the left make. They say, no, if we put enough pressure from the left, Trump will change his [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5789.26s)]
*  mind. Come on, please, please don't embarrass yourself, please. I mean, I would love to have [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5793.42s)]
*  that kind of power. Okay, Trump, make sure you change your mind. He's not gonna listen to the [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5800.22s)]
*  left at all. He's having a contest between MAGA and the neocons. So let's see what the MAGA guys [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5806.38s)]
*  have. If I'm wrong and they actually love war, then okay, great, we'll see it and I'll come out [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5811.82s)]
*  and tell you about it. Or if they're impotent and they say, well, we didn't wanna fight the neocons, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5816.14s)]
*  and so we were okay with the war because daddy Trump told us to be okay with it. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5824.3s)]
*  Then the jury will come in on MAGA, and I'm curious to see how that's gonna go. Sharon, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5828.62s)]
*  last thoughts. Okay, you made me laugh with that one. The left has the power over Trump. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5832.86s)]
*  The only thing I'll say is this. This fake escalation is so easy to detect. I mean, if [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5839.82s)]
*  this were real, you don't need two weeks. This is minute by minute, not even day by day. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5846.78s)]
*  This is imminent. So this whole thing that in two weeks he'll decide and those people who are the [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5853.74s)]
*  last in his dear can maybe get him to move one way or the other is just, I just find it so silly. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5860.14s)]
*  If it weren't so serious, it would actually be funny. Jordan? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5867.1s)]
*  I don't know if the best use of our time is to determine whether or not these people are sincere [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5872.38s)]
*  in being anti-war. Let them demonstrate their values through their actions, right? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5879.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5884.860000000001s)]
*  They can say what they want, but we'll just believe them when it comes down to [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5885.1s)]
*  when things actually escalate, when we are participating. If they flip and they throw [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5890.22s)]
*  their support behind Trump full-throated, we know them to be liars. So I'm just gonna wait and see [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5895.1s)]
*  for most of these figures. That's a super sensible position, right? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5901.820000000001s)]
*  And so, so far two people have proved themselves as actually anti-war, Thomas Massey and then on [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5905.5s)]
*  the media side, Dave Smith. So the libertarians have come in principled and bless their hearts. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5911.42s)]
*  Dave Smith agreed with us that we should unite against the war. So we started unitedagainstwar.com. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5918.06s)]
*  Please check that out. And what it is, is it's a pledge to say, I'll never vote for a politician [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5925.02s)]
*  that votes for yes on this war. They're gonna vote next week. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5931.26s)]
*  And if they give Trump the power to do that, you defeat them in your own primaries, whether you're [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5934.9400000000005s)]

*  paid by the Israeli lobby, then we should all go die for Israel. Okay, well, that's your call. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5945.58s)]
*  We're all gonna find out together, Jordan's totally right. We're gonna see, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5950.7s)]
*  was MAGA anti-war or were they monumentally full of crap the whole time? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5954.9400000000005s)]
*  All right, we're gonna take a break here when we come back. Speaking of monumentally full of crap, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5959.26s)]
*  Laura Loomer attacks everyone in sight, including Tucker Carlson and me. We'll be back. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5965.02s)]
*  Oh my God, you need Greg Louganis to get that far underwater. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=5970.14s)]
*  All right, back on TYT. Let's go to Super Chat. Bok said, who's to say Trump listens [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6060.14s)]
*  to anyone but himself? No, he listens based on his own self-interest. How's his ratings gonna [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6071.820000000001s)]
*  do? Is his base still with him? Who's bribing him? So he listens on things like that. 00083 says, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6077.02s)]
*  Israel's crying about war crimes. Wait a second, what about all the Palestinian hospitals? That's [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6084.3s)]
*  rich. Look, we should be concerned about all the hospitals and all the innocent civilians getting [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6089.58s)]
*  hurt. Yes, including the 94% of hospitals that were damaged or destroyed by the monstrous actions [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6093.66s)]
*  of the IDF. Bok also wrote in Iran is not using precision guided munitions. They're just lobbying [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6101.0199999999995s)]
*  everything they have in. It was random. No one wants to hear it from Bibi. Yeah, they're [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6109.34s)]
*  they're not as guided and then maybe you shouldn't use them. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6115.74s)]
*  On the other hand, maybe Israel shouldn't have attacked them. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6119.820000000001s)]
*  Okay, Austin says, Laura Looney, this is now YouTube members. Laura Looney made fun of [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6127.02s)]
*  Theo Von's addiction recovery because he's questioning Bibi's motivations. She's disgusting. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6132.06s)]
*  Yeah, but I think as we're gonna talk about in the next segment, I think she's accidentally [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6136.780000000001s)]
*  helping us cuz she's like getting anyone who criticizes Israel. She attacks them so much and [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6140.06s)]
*  so ridiculously. She's getting them to dig in more. So keep going Laura. I like how stupid you are. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6146.06s)]
*  Corporal Media Sucks says, I've always believed in finding sincere common ground. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6152.780000000001s)]

*  FS says, everything is two weeks with this fool referring to Netanyahu. Ever noticed? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6162.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, brother, we definitely noticed. And now on Twitch, 3229071 says, the haters of Cenk from [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6166.38s)]
*  the left have to ignore all the times. And there's lots of them where Cenk disagrees with the right. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6174.78s)]
*  It's the only way to make their stupid arguments about him seem plausible. I don't get why they [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6180.14s)]
*  do it. That's easy cuz they're liars and they think that they're gonna gain from it in terms [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6184.62s)]
*  of views, money, branding, whatever stupid thing that they think they're gonna gain from it. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6189.74s)]
*  But are they lying about me supporting the right? Just watch five minutes of the Young Turks on any [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6196.46s)]
*  given day. Of course they are. They're giant, stupid liars. It's obvious. Okay, and Don Dada Dragon [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6201.02s)]
*  just has a fun one. Turkish tornadoes on a warpath today. Yeah, I hear you. We'll be back. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6209.02s)]
*  All right, back in the Young Turks, Cenk, Sharon and Jordan with you guys. Jordan, next story. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6226.3s)]
*  Take a look at this. It's interesting you're trying to derail my questions by calling me an [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6236.860000000001s)]
*  anti-Semite, which you are. I did not. Of course you are. And rather than be honorable enough to [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6241.26s)]
*  say it right to my face, you are in a sleazy feline way implying it or just asking questions [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6245.9800000000005s)]
*  about the Jews. I'm not asking questions about the Jews. There's nothing to do with [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6251.42s)]
*  Jews or Judaism. It has to do with a foreign government. Isn't Israel controlling our foreign [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6256.38s)]
*  policy? That's not about the Jews. As Tucker Carlson continues to fight against the potential [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6260.14s)]
*  of the US intervening in a foreign war with Israel and Iran, he's also gained another enemy. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6267.5s)]
*  Trump's new self-appointed loyalty enforcer, Laura Loomer, has officially declared war on [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6274.38s)]
*  Carlson and others in an unhinged social media bender. She's been on a war path, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6281.1s)]
*  attacking anyone who disagrees with Trump and the idea of going to war with Iran, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6288.14s)]
*  including conservative figures like Candace Owens and Matt Gaetz. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6293.1s)]
*  But she zeroed in on Tucker. Yesterday, Laura Loomer made a bold claim publicly accusing [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6297.02s)]
*  Carlson of, quote, being controlled by Muslims and being a propagandist for Qatar. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6302.54s)]
*  The claim stems from a Washington Examiner piece from last month looking at Qatar's [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6309.34s)]
*  lobbying efforts with the US. The Washington Examiner's Robert Schmad reported on Qatar's [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6313.98s)]
*  big dollar efforts in May, writing, quote, perhaps Qatar's biggest victory in its post-election [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6321.5s)]
*  right-wing media campaign thus far was securing an interview between Tucker Carlson and the Qatari [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6327.18s)]
*  prime minister in March. The interview, which has raked up nearly 6 million views across [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6332.7s)]
*  X and YouTube, was friendly, with Carlson praising the country. Schmad added, [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6339.66s)]
*  Qatar paid top dollar to ensure this interview took place. Foreign Agents Registration Act records [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6344.94s)]
*  show that Lumen 8 Advisors LLC, a legal consulting company for which very little public information [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6350.7s)]
*  is available, helped facilitate between Carlson and the Qatari dignitary. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6357.099999999999s)]
*  The embassy of the state of Qatar pays Lumen 8 Advisors $180,000 per month to, quote, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6361.740000000001s)]
*  provide media and communication coaching and consulting services. To be clear, [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6367.34s)]
*  the records don't prove that Tucker Carlson himself was directly paid for the interview, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6373.18s)]
*  only the intermediary who set up the interview. But here's a condensed version of what Loomer [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6378.54s)]
*  initially stated. This was a paid propaganda piece in which over $200,000 was paid by the embassy [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6384.14s)]
*  of the state of Qatar for Tucker to interview a Qatari official, all while knowing Hamas [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6391.42s)]
*  is an Iranian proxy funded by Qatar. Qatar funds Islamic terror around the world, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6397.42s)]
*  and they think they can just pay everyone off to make them turn a blind eye. The Qataris are global [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6404.620000000001s)]
*  funders of Islamic terrorism, and their money has been used to murder American citizens. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6409.18s)]
*  Tucker should just be honest that he's a mouthpiece for genocidal Muslims. His media [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6415.1s)]
*  company was literally funded by a Muslim investor who is half Pakistani and half Iranian, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6419.74s)]
*  and who spends a lot of time in Qatar. And trust me when I say a lot of people in pro-Trump circles [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6425.9s)]
*  are very uncomfortable with this. Tucker Carlson disputed this claim on Steve Bannon's war room. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6432.0599999999995s)]
*  Take a look. I was never mad at Mark Levin or Hannity. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6438.62s)]
*  I like Hannity. A brilliant constitutional guy. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6442.46s)]
*  Yeah, there are great things about all these people. I don't think they hate me personally. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6444.78s)]
*  They know I'm not working for Qatar. I feel like maybe I should be working for Qatar. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6448.3s)]
*  What the hell at this point? I've never taken a dime from any foreign country or anybody, actually. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6453.820000000001s)]
*  In fact, you just bought out, I think it was announced you bought out your investors. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6459.1s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not a money guy. I mean, they're projecting my whole life. I'm totally happy [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6462.06s)]
*  to tell you why I'm doing what I'm doing, and I want to be transparent, and I think [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6466.54s)]
*  pretty much I am. They're the ones who have these weird complex motives, and so they project onto [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6470.38s)]
*  everyone else the same. You're getting paid by somebody. You're not sincere. You don't really [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6476.46s)]
*  think that you're saying it in order to get clicks. It's also dumb. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6481.66s)]
*  In other posts throughout the day, she posted things like, [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6487.58s)]
*  Dear Tucker Carlson, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I don't have the opportunity today to tell you to blank [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6491.42s)]
*  off to your face and call you out for letting your mouth serve as a blank warmer for Arabs. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6498.3s)]
*  I'm sorry I can't say blank you to your face for the way you undermine President Trump. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6505.34s)]
*  A large portion of her posts were met with community notes disproving her claims or [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6511.9800000000005s)]
*  criticism, which of course she responded to with more attacks, accusations of being fake, [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6516.3s)]
*  MAGA, etc. She's also threatened to tell Daddy Trump about their bad behavior. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6521.74s)]
*  I am screenshotting everyone's posts, and I'm going to deliver them in a package to President [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6527.1s)]
*  Trump. So he sees who is truly with him and who isn't. We need to end this culture of people [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6531.66s)]
*  rising to the top after they bash Donald Trump and attack his policies. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6537.42s)]
*  We need to stop rewarding disloyalty and set some standards for what is and isn't allowed to be [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6541.42s)]
*  around Donald Trump. I am the loyalty enforcer. Cenk, have you demonstrated sufficient loyalty to [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6547.42s)]
*  President Trump? [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6557.58s)]
*  No, I have not. So, or to Laura Loomer or to Israel, and that's why Laura Loomer also attacked [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6558.780000000001s)]
*  me later in the day, which we'll get to in a sec. She's attacking everyone who's opposed to Israel [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6567.18s)]
*  because she's really worried about foreign governments influencing America. Right, it's [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6572.620000000001s)]
*  okay if Israel does it, but she claims she's concerned if Qatar does it. I don't know who's [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6580.780000000001s)]
*  taking money from who, and I don't care. So you want to find that out and you want to [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6586.22s)]
*  reveal things about people? Great, I love it. Well, let's find out. I'm not opposed to that, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6590.860000000001s)]
*  I'm in favor of it. But what I care most about is are we going to war or are we not? [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6595.9800000000005s)]
*  How is this going to affect policy? Okay, and let's just make a note about hypocrisy first [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6600.38s)]
*  before we move on. So 80% of Congress took money from AIPAC in this election cycle if they were up [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6606.3s)]
*  for reelection, 80%. And look at that, 80% of Congress says we should do whatever Israel wants. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6615.26s)]
*  What a coincidence. And AIPAC, a lobbying group that lobbies American politicians [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6623.1s)]
*  on behalf of Israel, they say Israel supporters. Okay, it doesn't matter, either way. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6630.3s)]
*  The bottom line is they want those politicians to do exactly what Israel orders them to do. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6635.34s)]
*  And then politicians do exactly that, do exactly that. But in mainstream media, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6642.46s)]
*  they say, no, the hundreds of millions of dollars that AIPAC has spent on our honorable, [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6646.86s)]
*  honorable politicians has not affected them at all. And not at all, it's just total coincidence. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6651.82s)]
*  No, Israel is legally bribing all of our politicians and they totally and utterly control them. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6657.58s)]
*  What's interesting about Trump is that since he screws over all of his creditors, [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6664.94s)]
*  since he already took Maryam Adelson's money and a lot of AIPAC and affiliated lobbying money from [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6669.58s)]
*  different people at different times in his political career, he's a little bit more up [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6676.139999999999s)]
*  in the open. And he's like, well, now Qatar's giving some money and they're buying him a jet. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6681.66s)]
*  And then they're giving money to his sons and his businesses. So he's like, I don't know, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6686.78s)]
*  I'm getting bribed on both sides. So he's up for grabs. So Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon and others, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6690.54s)]
*  we might hate him on other stuff, but they're like, don't go to war with Iran. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6697.98s)]
*  Remember our whole position was anti-war, right? And Laura Loomer's saying, how dare you? [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6701.099999999999s)]
*  You must obey Israel, okay? And if you don't, you serve Muslims and Muslims are dirty and terrible. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6708.459999999999s)]
*  She alluded to in attacking me. But then if you say, hey, Israel seems to be bribing all [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6717.82s)]
*  of our politicians, anti-Semites, right? So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6724.54s)]
*  Laura Loomer's one of the most racist, bigoted agents that Israel has. I'm sorry, I don't know [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6730.78s)]
*  that. I don't know that. It doesn't matter. She doesn't have to be an agent. She could just have [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6736.86s)]
*  a natural affinity to a foreign government. And either way, it's plainly obvious she wants [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6741.82s)]
*  all Americans to serve a different country. If anyone else did it, if I came out here and was [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6747.98s)]
*  these people are anti-Turkish, anti-Turkish, you must do exactly what the Turkish government [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6754.299999999999s)]
*  orders you to do. People will be like, that's a freaking joke. If Turkey bribed 80%, I'm sorry, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6758.62s)]
*  friends of Turkey, bribed 80% of our politicians and then all of a sudden we're starting wars on [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6763.5s)]
*  behalf of Turkey. Everyone would point it out because it'd be mental not to. But when it's [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6768.219999999999s)]
*  Israel, shh, you're not allowed to say it. You're not allowed to say it. No, I can say it and so can [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6772.78s)]
*  everyone else and Laura Loomer can go suck it. Right, she already has. All right, Sharon. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6778.94s)]
*  I'm sorry she's being cruel to you, but I think you can handle yourself. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6785.98s)]
*  I think you're right, she's helping. She's vile, she's racist, but this is actually great. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6789.5s)]
*  And she's actually, if I go back to the last segment, making Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6796.379999999999s)]
*  and Marjorie Taylor Greene look like they have a lot of integrity here, okay? She's just pledging [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6801.98s)]
*  to a king and another country and name calling and I think it's very transparent. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6806.3s)]
*  And I don't even know if it's gonna weigh heavily with Trump at this point. I mean, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6813.5s)]
*  she's so loud and so on note all the time with this. She's helping the other side, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6818.860000000001s)]
*  but she's also I think maybe grading and getting, when there's that much noise, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6825.820000000001s)]
*  I don't know if Donald Trump is even listening to her. He likes to hear his own voice, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6830.78s)]
*  not necessarily always hers. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6834.46s)]
*  Yeah, well, Jen, she also went after you. When you posted this, Guardian is reporting the US is [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6838.22s)]
*  considering dropping a tactical nuclear weapon on Iran to destroy their facilities. That's the most [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6845.9s)]
*  mental thing I've ever heard. So we would nuke them to make sure they don't get a nuke because [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6851.74s)]
*  nukes are so dangerous. So we'll use one WTF. I think it's a reasonable point. But Loomer responded [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6857.02s)]
*  with another day another Muslim commentator lying about President Trump to sow discord [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6863.42s)]
*  in our community. This is fake news, Cenk Uygur. You deliberately lie about President Trump's foreign [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6868.9400000000005s)]
*  policy to push for chaos and Trump hatred. You have been lying all week about a non-existing [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6874.06s)]
*  war that the US is not involved in. What do you say to that? How do you respond to that, Cenk? [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6879.9s)]
*  Imagine if I said, another lying Jew commentator. Okay, everyone would flip out, rightfully so, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6887.660000000001s)]
*  because that's deeply anti-Semitic and terrible, etc. But I would never do that because I would [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6895.18s)]
*  never ever want to smear or associate other Jews with Laura Loomer. It got nothing to do with her, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6900.9400000000005s)]
*  they're innocent, okay? No, Laura Loomer is the one who's a deranged psychopath who demands that [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6908.14s)]
*  we all serve Israel, not anyone else. But so she attacks me based on my background. Of course, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6915.42s)]
*  she does, cuz she's a deeply dumb racist bigot, and that's all she's got in her arsenal. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6920.86s)]
*  I mean, she's talking about how Tucker Carlson is too pro-Muslim. Yeah, the guy who said, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6927.02s)]
*  I don't really care about Iraq cuz they're a bunch of monkeys. He's too pro-Muslim. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6932.46s)]
*  And so, but that's all she has. She has two tricks in her arsenal. One is, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6937.66s)]
*  I hate all Muslims. But by the way, don't ever say anything against me, otherwise I'll pretend [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6944.7s)]
*  to be offended that you're an anti-Semite, cuz she's so concerned about bigotry, she does it [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6949.18s)]
*  nonstop. So her and I went back and forth a couple times, and all she ever did was just say, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6953.74s)]
*  all Muslim, Muslim, Muslim, Muslim. She charged me with being Muslim. Okay, so what? [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6958.14s)]
*  What, is that a charge? Wow, you got me. Yes, my background is Muslim. That's not a thing that [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6963.9s)]
*  wins the argument for you. All right, so look, the jury's in on Laura Loomer. Total utter nut job. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6969.58s)]
*  Everyone despises her on the left and the right. And by the way, if you're on the left and you [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6977.58s)]
*  think that Laura Loomer speaks for MAGA or the right, you don't know anything. MAGA generally [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6982.54s)]
*  hates Laura Loomer. And they're like, no, no, they follow whatever she says. You think MAGA hates [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6987.66s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon? Cuz that's who she's attacking. No, they don't. No, they think [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=6994.54s)]
*  she works for Israel and they don't give a goddamn about her. And that's one good thing about MAGA. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7000.7s)]
*  Okay, damn it, we're out of time. All right, we gotta take a break here. We'll be right back. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7006.22s)]

*  couple of these. Teddy Lucy Linda wrote in on tyt.com. I saw Tucker Carlson interviewed by Chris [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7097.34s)]
*  Cuomo. And by the end of it, I felt he was genuine in his anti-war position. Look, whether he's [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7101.98s)]
*  genuine or not, he's definitely anti-war. That's what he says every day on his show. He eviscerated [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7106.38s)]
*  Ted Cruz on it. He's fighting Laura Loomer on it. Even if you think it's a trick, it doesn't really [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7113.58s)]
*  matter, because that's what he's telling his audience every day. You should be anti-war. You [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7118.38s)]
*  should be anti-war. You should be anti-war. So I'll take it and run. Almost never happens. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7121.74s)]
*  So Little Mac McGee wrote in, that is 100% true. I don't watch TYT every day, but I watch almost [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7126.62s)]
*  every day. And it amazes me when I do my best to check out the other shows to not be in a bubble [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7132.38s)]
*  and see them critique TYT. What always happens, now I haven't read the rest, so I'm super curious [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7137.9800000000005s)]
*  to see what happens. Okay, they cherry pick one or two segments, cut it off, take it out of context, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7144.3s)]
*  and attack it. If I could magically make one thing happen, it would be to make any person who watched [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7150.06s)]
*  the segment of TYT be motivated to actually watch a full show. Yeah, if you're seeing people take [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7156.38s)]
*  parts of our clips, you should go watch the whole clip. And then you'll see what gigantic [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7163.34s)]

*  right, who cares about that policy? Palestinians, who cares, who cares? Let's tear down the left. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7178.14s)]
*  And how do they do it? By lying and lying and lying and lying. So people keep getting surprised, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7183.9s)]
*  you're against Trump? Watch one minute, one minute of the young Turks. But of course, [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5fLjDm9pco&t=7190.54s)]
