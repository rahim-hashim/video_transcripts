"Kristi L. Noem, the U.S. homeland security secretary, threatened Wednesday to send more immigrants from the United States to a notorious maximum-security prison in El Salvador that has become a black hole for Venezuelans spirited out of the United States with no judicial hearing."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Trump Admin Is Handling Deportations In The WORST WAY
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM)
*  Here at CICOT today and visiting this facility. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=0.0s)]
*  And first of all, I wanna thank El Salvador and their president for [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  their partnership with the United States of America to bring our terrorists here and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=6.08s)]
*  to incarcerate them and have consequences for the violence that they've perpetuated in our communities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=10.0s)]
*  I also want everybody to know if you come to our country illegally, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=15.44s)]
*  this is one of the consequences you could face. First of all, do not come to our country illegally. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility is one of the tools [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=24.16s)]
*  in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=29.12s)]
*  Well, there you have Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem using actual human beings as a prop [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  for her cute little video there. She's in El Salvador. She is showing off the detention [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=41.84s)]
*  facility for terrorists that immigrants have been sent to by the Trump administration. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=49.28s)]
*  And now she's threatening to send even more immigrants there, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=55.6s)]
*  presumably with no due process or even proof that these people are even criminals. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=58.56s)]
*  Now, look, there are two things happening here and I don't want anyone to conflate the two. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=65.2s)]
*  The right would argue anyone who enters the country illegally is a criminal and we should [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=70.48s)]
*  treat them all the same. I disagree with that entirely, entirely, okay? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=75.2s)]
*  Now, I wanna separate people who might have entered the country illegally, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  okay? From those who also did the same, but on top of that, are part of gangs, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=84.4s)]
*  are committing violent crimes and all that stuff. I know there are people on the far left who think [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  you shouldn't even do that differentiation. Everyone should be allowed to stay. I disagree [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  entirely. You can be upset about that if you'd like, okay? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  Now, here's the thing though. If you're gonna try to justify [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=101.44s)]
*  deporting Venezuelan migrants to another country, not Venezuela, to El Salvador, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=106.56s)]
*  and your whole argument is, well, these are dangerous violent criminals, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=113.28s)]
*  that should be adjudicated by the courts. Because if you create a situation in which it is okay [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=117.52s)]
*  for the executive branch to just unilaterally pointed anyone and accuse them of anything [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=124.08s)]
*  and without any due process, they are punished for it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=130.88s)]
*  That's what I call big government, my friends. Government doesn't get any bigger than that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=135.28s)]
*  And it's something that deteriorates the rights of everyone. Due process is super important. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=138.56s)]
*  Because if you create this situation now under Trump, and for anyone on the right who might [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=146.72s)]
*  be watching this, if you think that's okay, because you like Trump, you agree with everything Trump's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=151.2s)]
*  doing, well, I mean, that's a precedent for a Democratic president to come in. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=155.2s)]
*  I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want a Democratic president or members of that president's cabinet [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  to point at people that might be on your side and say, they're engaging in criminality, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=165.6s)]
*  I'm gonna punish them, no due process. First of all, I'd be furious about that because [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=170.96s)]
*  whether someone holds ideas or political views that differ from mine doesn't matter. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=176.4s)]
*  At the end of the day, the bigger picture is the importance of protecting our rights and not [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=182.64s)]
*  allowing anyone in government to unilaterally decide whether or not we are guilty of something. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  We have a whole system of government, a whole system of checks and balances. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=197.52s)]
*  A judge needs to weigh in and adjudicate. You need evidence of wrongdoing. You need evidence [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=201.12s)]
*  that a crime is committed. And that brings us to this unbelievably disgusting story [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=207.52s)]
*  involving one of the migrants who was sent to this facility for terrorists in El Salvador, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=212.16s)]
*  just simply based on a tattoo that the Trump administration mistook for a Trende Aragua [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=220.4s)]
*  tattoo. In reality, it was the symbol representing autism awareness. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=228.08s)]
*  So, thanks to new reporting, we have this shocking example of how ICE and Homeland Security [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=234.72s)]
*  snatched this Venezuelan migrant who likely had nothing to do with gangs, nothing to do with [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=243.6s)]
*  violent criminality, simply because of their tattoos. One of the men included on the list of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=248.8s)]
*  deportees is Neri Alvarado Borges. And according to Mother Jones, he may have been targeted because [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=254.0s)]
*  of an autism awareness tattoo. Now, Alvarado lived in a small city in Northern Venezuela [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=262.4s)]
*  before coming to the United States in late 2023. His father is a farmer and his mother [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=268.79999999999995s)]
*  supports his 15-year-old brother, Nellie Nellerson. So here's a photo. Here's Neri with his brother. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  So, Alvarado's older sister Maria insists that her brother has absolutely no connection to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  Trende Aragua. And that should be adjudicated through our courts, but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=291.44s)]
*  the Trump administration doesn't believe in due process. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=296.16s)]
*  And unfortunately, there's so much hatred toward immigrants in this country [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=298.88s)]
*  that people are willing to sacrifice their own rights. They're willing to sacrifice due process [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=304.24s)]
*  in order to get rid of these people, even if there's no evidence that they're [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=310.96s)]
*  part of Trende Aragua at all. So, she also said that he used to teach swimming classes for children [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=314.56s)]
*  with developmental disabilities. Wow, real threat to the country. So, let's take a look at the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=321.28s)]
*  tattoo. This is the tattoo in question. Anyone who confuses this for a gang tattoo is a literal [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  moron, okay? And should probably go to continuation school because their high school diploma means [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=330.64s)]
*  nothing. If you're not able to determine that that is not a gang tattoo, there's something wrong with [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=339.84s)]
*  you. Now, Maria says, anyone who's talked to Neri for even an hour can tell you what a great person [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=344.32s)]
*  he is. Truly, as a family, we are completely devastated to see him going through something [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=350.08s)]
*  so unjust, especially knowing that he's never done anything wrong. He's someone who, as they say, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  wouldn't even hurt a fly. And by the way, guys, the detention facility that this man was sent to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=361.28s)]
*  it's full to the brim of actual violent criminals. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=370.96s)]
*  It is literally a detention facility for terrorists in El Salvador. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=375.28s)]
*  So, do you really think that someone who simply entered the country illegally, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=380.56s)]
*  I get it, people don't like that, I get it. But do you think that that is enough [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=386.32s)]
*  to put that person in a prison cell in El Salvador that is meant for terrorists [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=391.12s)]
*  and violent hardened criminals? Nonetheless, according to the report, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  Alvarado was detained by ICE outside his apartment in early February and brought in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=405.84s)]
*  for questioning Juan Enrique Hernandez, the owner of two Venezuelan bakeries in the Dallas area. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=410.32s)]
*  And Alvarado's boss told Mother Jones. One day later, Hernandez went to see him in detention. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  Alvarado told Hernandez that an ICE agent had asked him if he knew why he had been picked up. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=421.84s)]
*  Alvarado said he did not know. Well, you're here because of your tattoos, the ICE agent replied, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=428.32s)]
*  according to Hernandez. We're finding and questioning everyone who has tattoos. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=434.96s)]
*  Okay, apparently we have ICE agents who are morons and can't differentiate between gang [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=442.08s)]
*  tattoos and an autism awareness tattoo. According to both Hernandez and Marie Alvarado, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  the ICE agent told Neri, you're clean. I'm going to put down here that you have nothing to do with [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=455.67999999999995s)]
*  Trende Aragua. But for some unknown reason, another official in ICE's Dallas field office [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=462.08s)]
*  decided to keep Alvarado detained anyway. And so shortly before he was sent to El Salvador, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=469.28s)]
*  Neri reportedly told Hernandez, there are 90 of us here. We all have tattoos. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=475.44s)]
*  We were all detained for the same reasons. From what they told me, we are going to be deported. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=481.76s)]
*  So they assumed that meant he'd be deported to Venezuela, that's where he's from, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  not El Salvador. Now, there are some issues right now with Venezuela because they're refusing to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=494.96s)]
*  take their own citizens back. And so that led to an issue for the Trump administration. Well, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=500.32s)]
*  what do we do with these migrants? And that's when they made the deal [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=506.32s)]
*  to pay El Salvador $6 million in US taxpayer money to detain undocumented immigrants [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=510.0s)]
*  from our country in their prison system, in this facility that was built for terrorists and [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=517.76s)]
*  hardened violent criminals. By the way, man, Venezuela, what a joke, seriously. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=525.36s)]
*  You're not going to take your own people back. You're going to acknowledge that this is what [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump is going to do with them, and you're totally fine with it. Okay, absolute garbage. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=535.76s)]
*  So sadly, it's not just Neri. So Mother Jones spoke to the friends and family members of nine [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=541.36s)]
*  other men who believe that they were also sent to CICOT, that's the facility in El Salvador, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=547.36s)]
*  because of their tattoos. All of them say that their loved ones had no connection to gangs [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=552.48s)]
*  whatsoever, and many provided documented evidence that they had no criminal record, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  even in Venezuela. But the government is defiant because of course, and look, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=562.08s)]
*  let's just talk about the political motivations here, okay? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=567.76s)]
*  Because I think that's what's driving this more than anything. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=570.72s)]
*  Trump is starting to see a pretty significant decline in his approval ratings, especially on [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=574.08s)]
*  specific issues like the economy, for obvious reasons. But the one area where Trump is still [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=579.44s)]
*  polling pretty well among the American people is immigration. And so he's going to emphasize [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=584.96s)]
*  his immigration policies. He's going to double down. And in fact, recently he was frustrated [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  because you can't just do mass deportation without the resources necessary to do it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=598.72s)]
*  You need Congress to pass legislation and fund the agenda that you want to carry out. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=606.1600000000001s)]
*  But Trump knows that's not gonna happen, okay? So he's been frustrated by that. And now it's just [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=612.0s)]
*  anyone that I can deport, anyone that gets caught up in this whole mess, I don't care. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=618.24s)]
*  We're not gonna make any apologies for it. We're not going to look back and say, hey, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=623.6s)]
*  we made mistakes. We're just gonna keep going because this is the one area [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=627.52s)]
*  where Trump seems to be pretty popular. Now, will he continue to be popular in this area [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=631.12s)]
*  when you hear stories of American citizens who accidentally got rounded up? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=637.1999999999999s)]
*  When you hear stories of migrants who may have entered the country illegally but haven't done [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=642.48s)]
*  anything wrong other than that, haven't joined a gang, haven't committed violent crimes. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=646.96s)]
*  Are Americans gonna be cool with more and more stories like this coming out? I don't know. To [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=652.24s)]
*  be honest, I don't know. I keep getting surprised by the things that end up being popular these days. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=658.4s)]
*  But I guess we're gonna have to wait and see. I find this to be incredibly unjust, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=664.08s)]
*  again, because of the lack of due process. Because of the fact that someone who merely [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  entered the country illegally is now stuck in a prison cell that was meant for terrorists [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=672.48s)]
*  and violent criminals. So as I mentioned, the government is defiant. Robert Sernub, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=677.52s)]
*  an acting field office director for ISIS Removal Operations Branch, said the agency did not simply [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=684.72s)]
*  rely on social media posts, photographs of the alien displaying gang-related hand gestures or [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=690.72s)]
*  tattoos alone. Okay, great. So what did you rely on? Well, he acknowledged that many of the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=696.24s)]
*  Venezuelans Trump deported under the Alien Enemies Act had no criminal histories in the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=701.84s)]
*  United States. Wow, what an admission. Okay, great. But he did twist that fact to justify [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  the deportations without due process. And again, that's the important thing here, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=713.52s)]
*  the lack of due process. The lack of a criminal record does not indicate they pose a limited [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  threat. In fact, based upon their association with TDA, by the way, who determines that they [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=722.8000000000001s)]
*  have an association with TDA? Just anyone in the Trump administration can make that point, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=731.44s)]
*  and we're just gonna believe it without any evidence. Okay, yeah. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=737.12s)]
*  The lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=740.72s)]
*  the risk they pose. It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=745.2s)]
*  we lack a complete profile. Okay, just let that sink in. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  We don't have any record of any wrongdoing, but that could mean we just don't know, and this [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=758.24s)]
*  person could actually be really dangerous. We just don't have a record. That is such a crazy [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=764.32s)]
*  thing to say. I mean, it could demonstrate that you have no proof that they're guilty [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=769.2s)]
*  of committing the crimes that you've accused them for and have used as justification for [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=774.64s)]
*  their deportation. The Justice Department said in a court filing Monday that it was exercising [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=779.52s)]
*  what's commonly called the state secret's privilege in the case because sharing the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=785.2s)]
*  information would harm diplomatic relations and national security. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=790.32s)]
*  So they're reaching for anything. We have the evidence, but we don't wanna share it publicly [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=794.32s)]
*  because national security threat. It might ruin our relationship with our allies. Okay, right. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=799.6s)]
*  But to be fair, Donald Trump, well known for wanting to maintain his own privacy, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  well known for wanting to maintain America's relationship with its allies. Okay. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=813.52s)]
*  And even though the administration is facing lawsuits over their use of the Alien Enemies [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=818.88s)]
*  Act to deport immigrants with no due process, the privilege allows the US government to withhold [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  sensitive information such as intelligence sources and methods and foreign affairs details from [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=828.48s)]
*  becoming public as part of a court case. So that's the excuse that they're using. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=834.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that's going to really pass the smell test through these lawsuits that have been [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=839.28s)]
*  filed against the Trump administration. As we know, Judge James Boasberg has been trying [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=844.48s)]
*  to determine whether the Trump administration violated his order to halt or turn around the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=850.72s)]
*  deportation flights to El Salvador. He wanted to know when the planes took off and landed [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  and how many people were aboard those flights. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=862.72s)]
*  But Pam Bondi, Marco Rubio and Kristi Noem claimed to the judge that releasing information [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=866.72s)]
*  about the flights could compromise law enforcement methods. Obviously, it's just a flat out lie. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=872.16s)]
*  So Ashley Deeks, a law professor who teaches classes on national security, makes this argument. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=879.68s)]
*  The Trump administration's use of the privilege in the Venezuelans case was noteworthy because it [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=884.56s)]
*  wasn't in response to a request for information from the opposing attorneys, but rather from the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=891.2s)]
*  judge himself. So look, honestly, what happens next really isn't clear. I have no idea. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=897.84s)]
*  But to make myself abundantly clear, if our executive branch is going to be allowed [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=905.12s)]
*  to just simply accuse anyone of anything with no due process, this country, our constitutional [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=912.6400000000001s)]
*  rights are being dismantled right before our very eyes. And yes, constitutional rights [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=920.8s)]
*  are extended to people who are in the country illegally. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  This has been adjudicated by the Supreme Court over and over again. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  Even if you're an undocumented immigrant in the United States of America, you are still protected [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=934.88s)]
*  by the First Amendment, freedom of speech. You still have rights, including the right to do [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=939.12s)]
*  process. And these individuals who were accused of being members of Tren de Aragua never got their [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=944.16s)]
*  day in court, never had anything looked at by a judge. They got rounded up by members of ICE [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=949.36s)]
*  at the direction of the Trump administration. And without any evidence being provided without [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=957.92s)]
*  any proof, they got accused of being gang members and violent individuals who pose a threat to our [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=963.2s)]
*  national security and they got deported to a place where actual violent people and terrorists [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  are being detained. It's sick, it really is, it's sick. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=975.04s)]
*  Now you wanna make an argument for deporting people who are here illegally? Okay, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=980.32s)]
*  let's have that conversation, let's have that debate, let's have that argument. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=983.76s)]
*  But to make things up about people, to paint them as violent, dangerous individuals and not [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=987.68s)]
*  prove it at all is a huge problem for me. And it should be a huge problem for the rest of the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=994.08s)]
*  country, especially those who purport to care about constitutional rights whenever their [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=998.88s)]
*  least favorite politicians are in charge. You gotta be consistent, you either care about [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=1005.92s)]
*  our constitution or you don't, period. And I see a lot of hypocritical behavior going on right now [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=1011.2s)]
*  on the right as they're aiding and abetting this nonsense that could turn around and bite them in [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=1016.88s)]
*  the ass. Remember, Americans overwhelmingly supported the Patriot Act, which violated their [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=1022.0s)]
*  own civil liberties because they were so scared after 9-11. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=1026.72s)]
*  And then when all was said and done, they realized, man, we effed up. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=1031.44s)]
*  We allowed the government to scare us into essentially giving away our rights. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=1035.52s)]
*  And honestly, we're letting it happen again. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6JWLAgVnM&t=1042.64s)]
