The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# Trump Takes Aim At CRITICAL Federal Department
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q)
*  Well, the Education Department is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Trump administration's [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=1.6s)]
*  crosshairs. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=3.06s)]
*  Let's get into it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=3.74s)]
*  President Trump finalizing plans [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=4.62s)]
*  to gut the Department of Education. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=6.38s)]
*  Sources LABC News, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=8.86s)]
*  the President now weighing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=10.06s)]
*  an executive order to direct his [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=11.42s)]
*  education secretary to submit [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=13.06s)]
*  a proposal to dismantle the agency [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=14.82s)]
*  and call on Congress to eliminate [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=16.66s)]
*  it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=18.66s)]
*  To my friends who are upset, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=19.2s)]
*  I would say with respect, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=21.34s)]
*  call somebody who cares. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=23.34s)]
*  They better get used to this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=25.34s)]
*  It's USAID today, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=28.0s)]
*  it's going to be Department of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=29.08s)]
*  Education. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=30.72s)]
*  President Donald Trump is making [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  good on one of his campaign [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=33.96s)]
*  promises and that was to eliminate [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=35.92s)]
*  the Department of Education. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=38.48s)]
*  Now political reports that he [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=40.64s)]
*  intends to do so through [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=42.48s)]
*  an executive order. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=43.76s)]
*  Obviously, there are going to be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  some obstacles in accomplishing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=47.04s)]
*  this through an executive order and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=49.08s)]
*  I'll explain how in just a moment. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=51.12s)]
*  But the EO isn't going to be signed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=53.64s)]
*  until his education secretary is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=56.08s)]
*  confirmed and that of course is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=58.580000000000005s)]
*  Linda McMahon. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=60.82s)]
*  So from what we know at the moment, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=61.980000000000004s)]
*  Trump's plan to shutter the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=64.06s)]
*  education department would come in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=65.7s)]
*  a few different phases. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  So his executive order would direct [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=69.3s)]
*  the department to create a plan [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=71.62s)]
*  that would basically wind down [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=73.56s)]
*  the functions of this federal [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=75.72s)]
*  agency and its existing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=77.7s)]
*  administrative authority. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=79.48s)]
*  But the order was also expected to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=81.54s)]
*  call for the agency to inventory [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  a complex set of laws needed to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  delegate the department's powers [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=88.64s)]
*  to other agencies and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  then close the department. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  An acknowledgement that some of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=94.52s)]
*  conservatives biggest desires for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=96.64s)]
*  change hinge on congressional [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=98.88s)]
*  approval. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=100.88s)]
*  And this is where Trump is likely [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=101.56s)]
*  going to run into some issues with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=103.56s)]
*  what he's trying to do here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=105.72s)]
*  Now of course, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  Doge is involved in this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=108.8s)]
*  A third anonymous source that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=110.64s)]
*  he's going to be talking about is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  a third anonymous source that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=114.86s)]
*  spoke to Politico revealed that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=116.58s)]
*  representatives from the Department [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=118.46s)]
*  of Government Efficiency were [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=120.66s)]
*  working at the education [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=122.38s)]
*  department headquarters on Monday [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=123.78s)]
*  of this week. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=125.94s)]
*  They were seeking to access records [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=127.42s)]
*  at the agency. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  But if the Department of Government [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=130.98s)]
*  Efficiency is so [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=132.74s)]
*  worried about government waste, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=133.62s)]
*  and there is government waste, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=135.3s)]
*  I will concede that that's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=136.94s)]
*  certainly true. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=138.14s)]
*  It is a little strange, it's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=139.18s)]
*  curious that they keep focusing on [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=140.98s)]
*  these various government agencies [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=143.32s)]
*  that receive a tiny, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=145.48s)]
*  tiny sliver of resources from [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  the federal government relative to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=148.55999999999997s)]
*  what the Pentagon receives. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  And consider the fact that the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  Pentagon has failed every single [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=155.44s)]
*  audit, seven audits in a row. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=157.6s)]
*  They have failed every single one. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=159.56s)]
*  They're now receiving close to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=161.48s)]
*  a trillion dollars a year, okay, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=163.16s)]
*  money allocated to the Pentagon by [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=165.04s)]
*  Congress. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=166.88s)]
*  But take a look at this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=167.56s)]
*  This is the pie chart showing you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=168.44s)]
*  where our resources went for [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  fiscal year 2024. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=171.9s)]
*  So the Department of Education [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=173.26s)]
*  received $229 billion. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=175.62s)]
*  That sounds like a lot of money, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=177.82s)]
*  but it's $229 billion of the $9.7 [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=180.42s)]
*  trillion allocated to federal [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=183.38s)]
*  agencies in 2024. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=185.82s)]
*  Now Senate confirmation hearings for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=187.38s)]
*  Trump's education secretary pick, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=189.98s)]
*  Linda McMahon hasn't been [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=192.62s)]
*  scheduled yet. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=194.74s)]
*  Her financial disclosures and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=196.06s)]
*  other paperwork still need to be [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=198.5s)]
*  cleared by the Office of Government [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=201.08s)]
*  Ethics. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  But this effort to close [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  the Education Department puts her [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=206.28s)]
*  in a pretty rough spot once those [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=208.32s)]
*  confirmation hearings happen. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=210.16s)]
*  Common Sense tells me they won't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  attempt to close the Education [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=214.48s)]
*  Department until the secretary is [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=216.06s)]
*  confirmed, said another person [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=217.82s)]
*  familiar with the discussions who [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  was granted anonymity to address [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=221.24s)]
*  sensitive information. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=222.96s)]
*  And look, it is worth noting that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=225.04s)]
*  there could be a silver lining here [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  involving, I can't believe I'm [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  saying it, congressional [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=230.66s)]
*  Republicans, because some of them [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=232.26s)]
*  are already side eyeing these plans. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  And they're not necessarily in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  favor of shutting down the Education [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=238.7s)]
*  Department, and doing so, by the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=241.14s)]
*  way, is not as easy as signing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=243.33999999999997s)]
*  an executive order. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=245.33999999999997s)]
*  It's much more complex, here's why. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  I don't think we need the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=250.85999999999999s)]
*  Department of Education. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=251.66s)]
*  I'd be fine if it didn't exist, but [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=253.17999999999998s)]
*  I can also count to 60. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=255.22s)]
*  And to dismantle a federal [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=257.14s)]
*  department, you need an act of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=258.53999999999996s)]
*  Congress. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=260.22s)]
*  One of the Republican Party's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=261.40000000000003s)]

*  wasteful federal spending. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=264.92s)]
*  But abolishing a federal agency [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=266.76000000000005s)]
*  doesn't automatically turn off [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  the spending tab. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=270.12s)]
*  All the money the Department of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=271.16s)]

*  that's authorized by Congress. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=273.72s)]
*  All of these programs will continue [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=275.24s)]
*  to exist and get money unless [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=277.16s)]

*  What really matters is what we [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=284.04s)]
*  decide to do about the staffing and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=286.04s)]
*  funding of these assorted programs. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=288.38s)]
*  And it looks like congressional [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=292.22s)]
*  approval might stand in the way of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  Trump getting what he wants here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  Some conservatives concede they [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=296.38s)]
*  currently lack enough support for [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=298.14s)]
*  legislation to close the department [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=299.94s)]
*  and farm its core functions out to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=302.04s)]

*  But we have to wait and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  see what happens. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=307.1s)]
*  I mean, there could be a tremendous [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  amount of pressure on these [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=310.14s)]

*  Again, we have to wait and see. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=314.7s)]
*  But one thing that I want to just [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  clarify for everyone, I think [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=317.88s)]
*  there's a huge misconception about [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=319.48s)]
*  what the bulk of the Education [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=321.38s)]
*  Department actually does, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=323.0s)]
*  like what they focus on. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=324.6s)]
*  When it comes to the bulk of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=326.64s)]
*  funding that public schools receive, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=328.04s)]
*  that actually comes from property [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=330.0s)]
*  taxes that are paid on a local [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=331.68s)]
*  level. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=333.12s)]
*  The Education Department does do [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=333.92s)]
*  some work as it pertains to public [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  schools, but most of their focus, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=337.68s)]
*  especially when it comes to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=339.68s)]
*  financial elements of the department, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=341.16s)]
*  is for college students. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=343.44s)]
*  So they provide financial relief, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  loans, those types of things to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=347.42s)]
*  college students. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=349.46000000000004s)]
*  There are other things that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  the agency does as well, which I [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=352.3s)]
*  can get into in just a moment. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=354.0s)]
*  But before I do, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=355.86s)]
*  what are your thoughts, Cenk? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so this one is another one [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=357.74s)]
*  that I'm not sure about, and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=359.38000000000005s)]
*  I'm super curious to see what's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=360.98s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=362.68s)]
*  I'm going to tell you my opinion [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=363.78000000000003s)]
*  about it in a second, but [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=365.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm curious what you guys think too. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=366.62s)]
*  And this question really tests your [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=368.26000000000005s)]
*  optimism, pessimism, etc., [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=371.18s)]
*  to some degree. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=373.82000000000005s)]
*  So whenever we're live, which is [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=375.28s)]
*  Monday through Friday, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=377.06s)]
*  6 to 8 PM Eastern, we do polls on [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=378.32s)]
*  the topics that we're talking about. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=379.96s)]
*  It's in the chat. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=381.96s)]
*  It's also at tyt.com for this one, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  and the community as well. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=385.24s)]
*  Will the Republicans succeed in [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=387.48s)]
*  eliminating the Education [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=388.68s)]
*  Department? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=389.84s)]
*  Right now, I'm at a, I don't know. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=390.96s)]
*  I think I got it at about 50-50. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=393.44s)]
*  So number one, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=395.2s)]
*  do I think they should? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=396.08s)]
*  No, I oppose it, right? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=397.92s)]
*  That's easy for me. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=399.84s)]
*  I think education is [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=400.8s)]
*  monumentally important. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  Education saved my family's life. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=403.97999999999996s)]
*  My dad was a very poor farmer in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=405.7s)]
*  southeastern Turkey, got a free [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=407.62s)]
*  college education in the 1960s in [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=409.65999999999997s)]
*  Turkey, became a mechanical [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=411.85999999999996s)]
*  engineer, and we got to live [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=413.73999999999995s)]
*  the American dream ultimately [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  because of that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=417.62s)]
*  And so you're not going to find [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=419.62s)]
*  anyone more in favor of education [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=421.32s)]
*  than I am. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  So now, that doesn't mean that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=423.82s)]
*  everything that the Education [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  Department spends money on is wise. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  And remember that, I actually want [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=429.58s)]
*  to tell you a quick divergent [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=432.0s)]
*  story here, but it's going to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=434.04s)]
*  relate. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=436.16s)]
*  So part of the reason why the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=436.72s)]
*  teachers unions all backed Hillary [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  Clinton instead of Bernie Sanders [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=440.76s)]
*  in 2016, even though Bernie Sanders [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=442.92s)]
*  was so much more in favor of unions [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  and the teachers unions, was [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=447.32s)]
*  because they were so [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=449.24s)]
*  worried that Hillary Clinton would [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  go towards private education if [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  they didn't back her immediately, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  and she felt cross by them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=456.92s)]
*  Because that's what Barack Obama [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  did. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=460.48s)]
*  My God. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=461.0s)]
*  They didn't come into his camp [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=461.68s)]
*  early enough, so he punished them [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=463.56s)]
*  by emphasizing private education. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=465.68s)]
*  And so they were worried, my God, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=469.08000000000004s)]
*  we're going to go more corporate, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=470.88s)]
*  etc, etc. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=472.74s)]
*  So that's the Democratic Party, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  let's be honest with us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=474.88s)]
*  So if you said to me, hey, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=476.24s)]
*  I could find one or [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=477.32s)]
*  two things in the education [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=478.12s)]
*  department that doesn't make sense, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=479.16s)]
*  funds private education, etc. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=480.8s)]
*  Great, I would believe it, and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=482.32s)]
*  I would be against it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=483.88s)]
*  If you say nuke the whole [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=485.12s)]
*  department, I'm totally against it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=486.32s)]
*  Now as to why I'm uncomfortable, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm unclear here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=490.74s)]
*  Well, and the silver lining, and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=491.66s)]
*  I'm sure somebody will take it out [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=493.78000000000003s)]
*  of context, but here we go, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=496.04s)]
*  let me explain it in context. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=497.90000000000003s)]
*  So Republicans have been saying my [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=500.54s)]
*  whole life that they're going to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=502.14000000000004s)]
*  get rid of the Department of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=503.54s)]
*  Education, and they're going to do [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=504.74s)]
*  massive cuts. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=506.42s)]
*  And so they're going to save [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=507.66s)]
*  trillions of dollars. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=508.94000000000005s)]
*  It's not just Musk and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=510.14000000000004s)]
*  Trump that said it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=511.1s)]
*  Every Republican has been saying it [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=512.3000000000001s)]
*  for decades now, right? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=513.5s)]
*  And they all pretend that there's [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=515.0600000000001s)]
*  trillions of dollars in waste, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=516.1800000000001s)]
*  fraud, and abuse, etc. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=517.14s)]
*  And that they're going to clear [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=518.3000000000001s)]
*  that out, and why? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=519.1800000000001s)]
*  because they always say so we can [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=520.28s)]
*  give more tax cuts to the rich, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=521.52s)]
*  right? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=522.72s)]
*  So then Trump is saying [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  the same thing. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=524.24s)]
*  So now we're going to have it out. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=525.16s)]
*  Are they going to be able to kill [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=527.12s)]
*  the education department or [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=528.4s)]
*  are they not? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=529.52s)]
*  And so part of that will be [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=530.48s)]
*  determined by Republican and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=531.68s)]
*  they're going to need to filibuster [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=533.04s)]
*  proof things with some Democrats. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=534.64s)]
*  That's true, right? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=536.4s)]
*  So it's going to be difficult, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=537.08s)]
*  very, very difficult, okay? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=538.0s)]
*  But a lot of it is going to be [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=539.56s)]
*  determined by the reaction [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=540.76s)]
*  of the American people. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=541.96s)]
*  My guess is they'll say, no, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  brother, we ask you to keep prices [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  down. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=547.84s)]
*  We ask you to get us out of wars. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=548.6999999999999s)]
*  We ask you to have a very tough [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=550.8199999999999s)]
*  policy at the border. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=552.0999999999999s)]
*  So those are, you could consider [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=553.42s)]
*  that right wing position is [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=554.78s)]
*  moderate, whatever you want. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=555.8599999999999s)]
*  But that was very, very clear. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=557.2199999999999s)]
*  We didn't ask you to get rid of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=558.38s)]
*  the Department of Education. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=559.52s)]
*  So or they'll say, yeah, no, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=560.9799999999999s)]
*  we love it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=562.5s)]
*  We love the cuts. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=563.14s)]
*  We did ask you to get rid of it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  So I don't know the answer, and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=565.54s)]
*  I'm intensely curious to see what's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=566.9s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=568.42s)]
*  So I don't know the answer either. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=569.5s)]
*  Obviously, we're just speculating [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=570.9399999999999s)]
*  and we're predicting what could [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=572.78s)]
*  happen. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=574.3399999999999s)]
*  But what I do know is parents [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=574.9s)]
*  are upset with the public education [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=577.0s)]
*  system, even though the public [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=579.88s)]
*  education system is impacted more [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=582.2s)]
*  on a local level, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=584.76s)]
*  So there are some standardized [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=586.32s)]
*  elements to our public education [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=588.24s)]
*  system coming from the top and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=590.4s)]
*  the education department. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=592.28s)]
*  But in reality, when it comes to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=594.2s)]
*  funding decisions, that's actually [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=596.0s)]
*  far more localized than the Trump [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=598.28s)]
*  administration would have you [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=600.08s)]
*  believe. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=601.8000000000001s)]
*  So part of the messaging that [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=602.36s)]
*  I have a huge issue with coming from [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=605.14s)]
*  Trump administration officials and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=607.44s)]
*  Trump himself is they're making it [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=610.08s)]
*  appear as though the education [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=612.54s)]
*  department focuses all of its [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=614.7s)]
*  energy on public schools, but [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=616.82s)]
*  it doesn't. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=618.86s)]
*  Now it does do some work with [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=619.74s)]
*  public schools. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=621.1s)]
*  So for instance, again, public [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=621.9s)]
*  schools primarily a state and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=623.94s)]
*  local responsibility, but [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=625.82s)]
*  the Department of Education does [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=627.7s)]
*  serve more than 50 million students [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=629.86s)]
*  at 130,000 public and private [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=632.3s)]
*  schools. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=634.4599999999999s)]
*  The department provides billions to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=635.02s)]
*  aid students with disabilities and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=637.5s)]
*  students in low income communities. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  And the education department also [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=642.4599999999999s)]
*  provides financial aid for [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=644.4599999999999s)]
*  college students. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=646.0s)]
*  So FAFSA, that's a federal thing. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=647.14s)]
*  That's not a state or [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=648.98s)]
*  local thing, right? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=650.14s)]
*  FAFSA is what you apply to if you [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=651.42s)]
*  need financial aid so [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=653.14s)]
*  you can actually go to college. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=654.26s)]
*  So if you dismantle the education [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=656.06s)]
*  department, what government agency [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=658.14s)]
*  is going to handle college aid if [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=660.56s)]
*  a student wants to go to college? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=662.8399999999999s)]
*  And by the way, I agree with [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=665.12s)]
*  conservatives when they argue [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=666.8399999999999s)]
*  college isn't for everyone and [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=668.9599999999999s)]
*  there should be more emphasis on [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=671.04s)]
*  trade schools for some students. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=673.04s)]
*  I agree with you on that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=675.48s)]
*  So emphasize the trade schools but [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  also provide the opportunities for [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=678.92s)]
*  people who want to go to four year [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=681.12s)]
*  institutions to be able to do so. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=683.16s)]
*  If you dismantle the education [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=685.3199999999999s)]
*  department, you have to have some [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=687.16s)]
*  understanding in regard to what is [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=689.26s)]
*  going to happen to all these [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=691.36s)]
*  different services that are [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=693.0600000000001s)]
*  provided to the American people [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=694.74s)]
*  from this department. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=696.62s)]
*  Yeah, and so I don't know that [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=698.02s)]
*  they're going to bother with [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=699.96s)]
*  answers. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=702.0600000000001s)]
*  And so, and look, we give Trump [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=703.1s)]
*  credit sometimes for [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=705.1s)]
*  doing the optics right, right? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=706.54s)]
*  The Democrats never know how to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=708.94s)]
*  make their own case. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=710.54s)]

*  four years straight. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=713.14s)]
*  Chuck Schumer has been murmuring [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=714.1s)]
*  for about 20 years straight, etc. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=715.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=717.14s)]
*  There's like the world's worst [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=717.66s)]
*  years and Trump puts on the outfits. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=719.0s)]
*  He's like YMCA, he'll be a Native [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=721.16s)]
*  American student with the whole or [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=723.08s)]
*  Leatherman, I don't know. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=724.9200000000001s)]
*  But he was a garbage truck driver, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=726.16s)]
*  he was a McDonald's fries guy, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=728.4s)]
*  etc. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=730.36s)]
*  So now, when we give him credit for [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=731.52s)]
*  that, we say not that we agree with [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=734.16s)]
*  them, but hey, on a messaging way of [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  looking at it, that's effective. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=739.5600000000001s)]
*  So what is the message that [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=742.6800000000001s)]
*  conservatives and [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=744.4s)]
*  Trump and Maggard are sending now? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=745.6800000000001s)]
*  Whether you like it or not, or [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=747.86s)]
*  where you think it's fair that [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=749.22s)]
*  Americans are receiving this [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=750.5s)]
*  message or not, I'll tell you [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=751.74s)]
*  definitively the message that's [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=753.0600000000001s)]
*  being sent out. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=754.62s)]
*  We're not in favor of education. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=755.94s)]
*  Because if you were in favor of [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=758.5400000000001s)]
*  education, you would make a much [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=760.14s)]
*  more concerted effort to say, no, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=761.9s)]
*  no, no, we love education, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=763.74s)]
*  we want you guys to get an [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  education, we want everybody to be, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=766.5s)]
*  we want America to be strong and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=768.62s)]
*  have the smartest, brightest, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=770.4200000000001s)]
*  best educated citizens in the world. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=772.3000000000001s)]
*  But we think the Department of [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=775.5s)]
*  Education is not helping with that, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=776.6s)]
*  it's counterproductive, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=778.82s)]
*  But here's what we're going to do [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=779.36s)]
*  instead, right? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=780.6800000000001s)]
*  And we're going to make education [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=781.36s)]
*  better. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=782.96s)]
*  I've heard none of that. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=783.9200000000001s)]
*  No, there's none of that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=784.72s)]
*  And that's what worries me, right? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=785.72s)]
*  Because look, I'm not going to sit [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=787.0400000000001s)]
*  here and pretend we've got it all [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=789.0s)]
*  figured out when it comes to our [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=791.0s)]
*  education system. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  Our public education system is [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=793.9200000000001s)]
*  failing our students. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=795.6s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=796.84s)]
*  There's a huge portion of [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=798.08s)]
*  elementary school kids who should [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=799.6s)]
*  be able to read and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=801.5200000000001s)]
*  they're unable to read. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  That is a huge problem. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=803.9200000000001s)]
*  So when you have that issue and [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=804.98s)]
*  it's been festering for [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=806.86s)]
*  a long time in this country and [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=808.38s)]
*  year after year we keep falling off [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=810.38s)]
*  in terms of the country rankings in [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=812.86s)]
*  education, Americans are going to [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=815.38s)]
*  get increasingly angry and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=817.98s)]
*  frustrated when there haven't been [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=819.82s)]
*  any solutions. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=822.22s)]
*  And then when someone like Donald [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=823.4200000000001s)]
*  Trump comes along and he says, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=824.98s)]
*  the education department is failing [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=826.5s)]
*  the American people, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=828.4200000000001s)]
*  look at these test scores. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=829.5400000000001s)]
*  Well, at that point, all of these [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=831.4200000000001s)]
*  Americans are pretty much primed to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=833.48s)]
*  support the idea of dismantling [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=835.64s)]
*  that department. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=837.62s)]
*  And so I am curious to see how this [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=838.9200000000001s)]
*  plays out. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=840.96s)]
*  You are right. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=841.96s)]
*  Look, I think this is a perfect [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=842.6800000000001s)]
*  example of how our institutions [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=844.88s)]
*  work and how in some instances they [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=847.12s)]
*  hold, right? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=849.4000000000001s)]
*  So the Senate filibuster, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=850.2800000000001s)]
*  the legislative filibuster would [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=852.1800000000001s)]
*  make it incredibly difficult to [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=854.52s)]
*  find enough votes in the Senate to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  dismantle the education department. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=858.72s)]
*  So I actually don't think at [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=861.44s)]
*  the end of the day it's going to [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=862.6s)]
*  happen for sure. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=863.84s)]
*  Like people act like it's already [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=864.44s)]
*  happened. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=865.88s)]
*  But even if it's not dismantled, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=866.4000000000001s)]
*  we do need to come to terms with [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=868.5200000000001s)]
*  the fact that education has failed [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=870.24s)]
*  the American people, our students, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=872.32s)]
*  and there needs to be reforms and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=874.64s)]
*  changes. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=876.58s)]
*  And let's have that conversation. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=877.2s)]
*  Yes, and instead, look, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=879.72s)]
*  maybe we will, maybe we will. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=881.1800000000001s)]
*  Maybe it'll start a national [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=883.4000000000001s)]
*  conversation and this is where we [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  really need the Democrats to be [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=886.0400000000001s)]
*  effective, God help us. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=887.6400000000001s)]
*  So then tell us why the education [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=889.8000000000001s)]
*  department is essential. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=891.34s)]
*  Tell us what's so great about it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=893.1s)]
*  Emphasize the two or [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=894.5s)]
*  three parts that you love the most [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=895.44s)]
*  and you think are the most [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=897.1s)]
*  essential. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=898.2600000000001s)]
*  Don't just go them bad guys, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=899.0600000000001s)]
*  bad guys that we already know. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=901.46s)]
*  Okay, make an effective case. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=903.7s)]
*  And if you're Republicans, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=907.1400000000001s)]
*  I get that you want to do [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=908.7800000000001s)]
*  cost cutting. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=909.98s)]
*  But have you even made a case for [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=911.2600000000001s)]
*  making education better? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=912.6600000000001s)]
*  because I haven't seen it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=914.1800000000001s)]
*  So whether you like it or not, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=915.46s)]
*  the message you're sending out is, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=916.74s)]
*  we don't want any [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=918.4200000000001s)]
*  stinking education. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=919.1s)]
*  And so, and by the way, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=920.88s)]
*  then you've got to ask yourself, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=922.0400000000001s)]
*  why doesn't your side want [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=923.76s)]
*  the American people to be educated? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=925.08s)]
*  All you got to do is click that [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=950.1s)]
*  join button right underneath [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz7UNti2q7Q&t=951.44s)]
