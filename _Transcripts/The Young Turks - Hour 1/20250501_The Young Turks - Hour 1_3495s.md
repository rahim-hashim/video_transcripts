*  We're both here at the same time in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=40.64s)]
*  the studio, so God bless. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=41.88s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=43.08s)]
*  We're psyched about it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  All right, we got a bunch of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=45.56s)]
*  amazing stories. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=47.04s)]
*  Mike Walsh, down goes Michael. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=47.96s)]
*  Hold on, let me save it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=50.28s)]
*  Let me save it, okay? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=51.36s)]
*  And he doesn't down, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  sideways goes Mike Walsh. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=54.08s)]
*  We'll get to it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  So then Israel starving the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=58.0s)]
*  children of Gaza, of course, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=59.98s)]
*  will tell you what percentage of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=62.0s)]
*  the land that they have taken in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=64.14s)]
*  Gaza while they're doing self [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=66.16s)]
*  defense several years later, okay? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=67.98s)]
*  So a lot more to come on that huge [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=70.52s)]
*  turmoil overall in the Trump [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=73.0s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=75.44s)]
*  And then Carvel and David Hogg [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  throw down finally in the same room, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=79.78s)]
*  okay? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=82.8s)]
*  With a little twist. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=83.72s)]
*  Yeah, a little twisty twist. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=84.6s)]
*  Also, twisty twist on Daily Wire, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=86.56s)]
*  Ben Shapur and Matt Walsh. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=88.64s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  Is it a little bit of drums? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  And then at the end of the show, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=93.64s)]

*  the Belichick story. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=97.08s)]
*  And on tyt.com, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=98.0s)]
*  we have a fun poll. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=99.32s)]
*  Should we judge Bill Belichick for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=102.32s)]
*  dating a 24-year-old? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=105.56s)]

*  go vote at tyt.com. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=111.72s)]
*  And we'll report at the end [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=112.96s)]
*  of the show. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=113.96s)]
*  And finally, instead of the bonus [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  episode today, Ojeda's back. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=116.48s)]
*  He's joined the rebellion. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  Wait till you hear about his race [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=121.08s)]
*  in North Carolina, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=122.2s)]
*  you're going to love it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=122.92s)]
*  That's at 8 o'clock Eastern, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  available for everyone. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=125.04s)]
*  So let's get started. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=126.48s)]
*  Casper, what do you got? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=127.56s)]
*  Let's begin with the big news in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=128.52s)]
*  regard to Mike Waltz and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=130.52s)]
*  what was kind of thought of as [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=132.04s)]
*  a shakeup in Trump's administration, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=133.88s)]
*  but really not that much of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=136.32s)]
*  a shakeup. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=137.76s)]
*  Let's get into it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=138.28s)]
*  Waltz would be the first high [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=139.36s)]
*  profile departure from [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  the Trump administration, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=142.2s)]
*  if this proves to be true. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=143.8s)]
*  Now it's quite clear that just like [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=145.28s)]
*  many things in the Trump [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=146.88s)]
*  administration, the foreign policy [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=147.92s)]
*  front is not going well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  The war in Ukraine is still [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=151.44s)]
*  raging, the situation in Gaza is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=153.04s)]
*  awful, there are tensions between [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=154.88s)]
*  the US and China. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=156.48s)]
*  White House National Security [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=159.28s)]
*  Advisor Mike Waltz and his deputy [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=161.32s)]
*  Alex Wong were alleged to have [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=163.68s)]
*  been leaving the Trump White House [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=165.88s)]
*  as of this morning. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=168.36s)]
*  However, as that story developed, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=170.16s)]
*  we've learned that he's actually [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=172.28s)]
*  being tapped for a different role [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=174.12s)]
*  within the Trump administration. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=176.04s)]
*  He will be serving as ambassador to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  the United Nations. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=180.12s)]
*  And in the meantime, it appears [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=181.52s)]
*  that Secretary of State Marco Rubio [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=183.8s)]
*  will be the interim National [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=186.52s)]
*  Security Advisor until he's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=188.84s)]
*  replaced, maybe, we'll see, Cenk. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=191.24s)]
*  Sideways goes Mike Waltz, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  sideways goes Mike Waltz. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=196.36s)]
*  So he's not down and he's not out, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=198.56s)]
*  but he's hurt, dog, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=200.28s)]
*  don't ask him if he's all right. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=201.32s)]
*  Now the really interesting thing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=202.96s)]
*  about this story is why? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  Because a bunch of neocons were [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=206.4s)]
*  brought into the Pentagon and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  people against the war with Iran [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  were taken out of the Pentagon. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=213.36s)]
*  But Mike Waltz is a neocon and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  now he's taken out of the National [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  Security Advisor role. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  What in the world is going on? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=220.12s)]
*  Let's try to find out. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just going to say it is [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=223.08s)]
*  very unclear, but we're going to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  give you the facts and the details [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=227.24s)]
*  as we know them at this moment. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=229.28s)]
*  Obviously, this is a story that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=230.96s)]
*  needs to develop. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=232.56s)]
*  But this shakeup does obviously [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=233.36s)]
*  impact others as well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=235.2s)]
*  As I mentioned, Waltz will be [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=236.96s)]
*  the Ambassador to the United [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=238.44s)]
*  Nations. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=239.76s)]
*  And then Marco Rubio, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  who's the current Secretary of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=241.88s)]
*  State, will be the Secretary of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=243.24s)]
*  State. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=244.8s)]
*  He will remain in that role, but [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=245.3s)]
*  will also serve as the interim [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=247.0s)]
*  National Security Advisor. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=248.6s)]
*  So here's what Trump wrote on [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=250.4s)]
*  Truth Social in making this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=251.96s)]
*  announcement today. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=253.4s)]
*  I will be nominating Mike Waltz to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=254.8s)]
*  be the next United States Ambassador [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=256.6s)]
*  to the United Nations from his time [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=258.52s)]
*  in uniform on the battlefield. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=260.52s)]
*  In Congress and as my National [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=263.04s)]
*  Security Advisor, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=264.92s)]
*  Mike Waltz has worked hard to put [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  our nation's interests first. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  Has he? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=270.6s)]
*  I know he will do the same in his [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=271.48s)]
*  new role. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=273.72s)]
*  In the interim, Secretary of State [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=275.48s)]
*  Marco Rubio will serve as National [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=277.32s)]
*  Security Advisor while continuing [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  his strong leadership at [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=280.88s)]
*  the State Department. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=282.16s)]
*  Together, we will continue to fight [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=283.16s)]
*  tirelessly to make America and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  the world safe again. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=287.24s)]
*  Okay, so reports indicate that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  Laura Loomer had a hand in this, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  allegedly. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=293.6s)]
*  So apparently she was in Donald [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=295.88s)]
*  Trump's ear, essentially advising [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=297.8s)]
*  him against keeping Mike Waltz as [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=300.12s)]
*  part of his administration, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=302.2s)]
*  arguing that he isn't loyal enough. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=304.0s)]
*  She allegedly told Trump in this [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=307.32s)]
*  recent meeting at the Oval Office [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=309.0s)]
*  that he needs to get rid of Waltz [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=310.92s)]
*  and other aides who she believes [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  are insufficiently loyal to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=314.8s)]
*  the MAGA agenda, the Make America [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=316.48s)]
*  Great agenda or [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=318.56s)]
*  the America First agenda. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=319.48s)]
*  But the embattled National Security [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  Advisor was also under siege from [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  personalities such as Loomer, who [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=325.84s)]
*  had been complaining to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  administration officials that she'd [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  been excluded from the vetting [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=331.08s)]
*  process for National Security [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=332.67999999999995s)]
*  Council aides. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=334.32s)]
*  In her view, Waltz relied too much [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  on neocons, referring to hawkish [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=338.2s)]
*  neoconservatives within [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=340.67999999999995s)]
*  the Republican Party, as well as [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=342.44s)]
*  others who Loomer argued were not [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=344.4s)]
*  MAGA enough types. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=346.32s)]
*  Now Loomer is a confusing figure [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=347.44s)]
*  because of the fact that she is [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=349.56s)]
*  honestly a staunch supporter [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=351.56s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=353.64s)]
*  She's very much Israel first and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=354.91999999999996s)]
*  wants a war with Iran. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=356.84s)]
*  So the idea that she's against [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=358.56s)]
*  neocons doesn't really make much [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=360.24s)]
*  sense, but make no mistake about it, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  Waltz absolutely is a neocon. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=364.24s)]
*  In fact, Dana Bash from CNN, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=366.28s)]
*  who's very much a supporter of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=368.28s)]
*  Israel, seemed a little bit [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=370.12s)]
*  alarmed by the news today. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=372.12s)]
*  Let me give you a little taste of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=374.0s)]
*  what I mean. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=375.52s)]
*  First of all, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=377.04s)]
*  Mike Waltz is a very serious [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  person. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=379.44s)]
*  She said that with a straight face. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=383.0s)]
*  She said that with a straight face. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  Now what was she referring to? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=386.36s)]
*  Why is Mike Waltz such [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  a serious person? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=388.6s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  First of all, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=392.04s)]
*  Mike Waltz is a very serious [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  person. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  He is a former Green Beret, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=394.88s)]
*  he's a four time Bronze Star [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  winner. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  That all happened, that service, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=399.6s)]
*  military services, obviously well [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=401.6s)]
*  before he ran for Congress. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  As part of his sort of approach to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=406.04s)]
*  the world, it was much more hawkish [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  historically than anybody around [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  President Trump in the current form. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=415.8s)]
*  And so my understanding and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=419.48s)]
*  I'm curious what you all are [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  hearing is that nevermind signal [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  gate, it was that very fundamental [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=425.22s)]
*  mistrust of him and skepticism of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=427.88s)]
*  him and his perspective about [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=430.56s)]
*  the world that was also problematic [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=433.0s)]
*  from the start. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  It absolutely was and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  I think signal gate was the reason [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=438.23999999999995s)]
*  for his departure but [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  not really what led up to it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=442.08s)]
*  He is a hawk, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=444.23999999999995s)]
*  there's no doubt about it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  There have also been some rumors [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=446.64s)]
*  indicating that in the future he [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  will be replaced by Steve Witkoff [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=450.56s)]
*  who of course is Donald Trump's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=452.67999999999995s)]
*  special envoy to the Middle East. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  I should note that he is not loved [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  by the Israeli government in fact, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=459.12s)]
*  Israel's been fighting pretty hard [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=461.28s)]
*  and lobbying behind the scenes to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  get rid of Steve Witkoff entirely [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  because of the fact that he [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=467.88s)]
*  pressured Israel into agreeing to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=469.44s)]
*  a temporary ceasefire with Hamas [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=471.46s)]
*  which lasted about two months. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=473.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't know if Witkoff is really [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=475.52s)]
*  going to be tapped for this role, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=477.0s)]
*  but that would be fascinating. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=478.44s)]
*  Yeah, so this is as confusing as [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=480.44s)]
*  it gets so normally what we do on [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  the show is we tell you here's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=484.52s)]
*  what's actually happening behind [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=486.4s)]
*  the scenes and we'll lay out why. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  That clarifies almost all [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=490.76s)]
*  legislation and what happens in [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=492.08s)]
*  government which is followed [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=493.68s)]
*  the money. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=495.12s)]
*  In this case, I have no idea what's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=495.92s)]
*  going on and I almost never say [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=498.68s)]
*  that because how can you get rid of [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=500.92s)]
*  the anti war guys in the Pentagon [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=503.6s)]
*  and then get rid of Mike Waltz next [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=506.0s)]
*  who's definitely pro war? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=508.64s)]
*  How does that make any sense? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=511.56s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=512.84s)]
*  And then Laura Loomer is Israel [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=513.96s)]
*  first, but she's talking about [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  taking out neocons from inside [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=517.28s)]
*  the administration. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=518.8s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=520.1600000000001s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense at all. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  So, I mean one possibility is [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  Laura Loomer is just taking out [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=525.1600000000001s)]
*  America first guys pretending that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=528.0s)]
*  they're neocons just because [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=531.2800000000001s)]
*  neocons sounds bad. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=533.84s)]
*  So she's slapping that label on. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=535.88s)]
*  But second of all, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  why is Laura Loomer making [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=538.64s)]
*  decisions about who works in [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=540.12s)]
*  the US government? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=541.72s)]
*  I think that's the biggest [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=542.88s)]
*  question honestly, right? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=544.36s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=545.96s)]
*  me like what qualification does [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  she have? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=550.0s)]
*  Why does she have so much influence [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=550.6s)]
*  or sway over Trump or more [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=552.12s)]
*  importantly, Cenk, what if that's [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=553.32s)]
*  just a cover story, right? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=555.12s)]
*  Like we don't know for sure. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=556.68s)]
*  Yeah, so- [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=558.76s)]
*  And she did take credit by the way [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=559.44s)]
*  started rep you but she did to take [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=560.88s)]
*  credit today in regard to what's [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=562.52s)]
*  happening to Mike Waltz. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=564.24s)]
*  Loomer appeared to take credit in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=565.56s)]
*  a post on social media, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=567.56s)]
*  writing scalp. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=569.0s)]
*  Hopefully the rest of the people [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=571.08s)]
*  who were set to be fired but [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=572.8s)]
*  were given promotions at the NSC [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=574.26s)]
*  under Waltz also depart Loomer [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=576.0s)]
*  wrote in another post. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=577.56s)]
*  Go ahead, Cenk. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=579.04s)]
*  So in that post, I tried to [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=579.56s)]
*  interact with her because I don't [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  get it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=582.8s)]
*  I'm like, are you Israel first or [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=583.3599999999999s)]
*  are you against neocons? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=585.3599999999999s)]
*  So I'd love some clarification [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=587.64s)]
*  because here passes Israel first, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=589.04s)]
*  but maybe she's changed her mind. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=590.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's a very, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=592.4799999999999s)]
*  very doubtful but that's why it's. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=593.4799999999999s)]
*  And then somebody wrote like, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=595.16s)]
*  what are you bothering to talk to [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=596.88s)]
*  a loon like Laura Loomer for? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=598.68s)]
*  That shows you're not a serious [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  journalist. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=601.88s)]
*  Are you guys kidding me? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=602.4s)]
*  The cover story is that Laura [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  Loomer is making the final [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=606.5999999999999s)]
*  decisions on who gets fired at [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=608.4s)]
*  the White House. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=610.24s)]
*  So is that crazy? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=611.44s)]
*  Absolutely, right? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=613.2s)]
*  But is it true? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=615.04s)]
*  It seems like it might be true. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=616.48s)]
*  So then I've got to ask Laura [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=618.6s)]
*  Loomer, what's your actual agenda? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=620.44s)]
*  If you're, I don't know, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=623.12s)]
*  the vice president or [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=624.48s)]
*  whatever you are, right? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=625.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and want to know something [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=627.16s)]
*  insane. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  So if you guys can recall some time [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=629.08s)]
*  ago, Laura Loomer met with [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=631.36s)]
*  Donald Trump in the Oval Office to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=633.2s)]
*  persuade him to fire other [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=635.48s)]
*  individuals, right? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  That included Thomas Boudry, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=638.6s)]
*  a senior director for [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=640.52s)]
*  legislative affairs. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=641.88s)]
*  He was also Waltz's legislative [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=643.56s)]
*  director when Waltz was serving in [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=645.52s)]
*  the House of Representatives. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=647.48s)]
*  David Feath, a senior director for [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=649.52s)]
*  technology and national security. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=651.52s)]
*  So she's in the Oval Office trying [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  to convince Trump to fire [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=655.3199999999999s)]
*  these people. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=656.68s)]
*  Trump did fire these people. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=657.4s)]
*  In the room was Mike Waltz. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=659.12s)]
*  So Mike Waltz is basically sitting [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=661.9599999999999s)]
*  there listening to the woman who [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  certainly might have determined [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=665.6s)]
*  what his fate was within [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=667.48s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=668.64s)]
*  So part of the point, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=670.0400000000001s)]
*  the reason I say that is, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=671.24s)]
*  is Loomer representing other voices, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=675.4s)]
*  Because there's how could, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=676.08s)]
*  I mean, I know Trump's nuts, but [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=678.12s)]
*  really like one of the most unhinged [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=680.4s)]
*  right wingers, you're going to [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=682.88s)]
*  bring in like some blogger or [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=685.12s)]
*  whatever she is and go, okay, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=687.28s)]
*  who would you like to fire in [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=689.28s)]
*  the National Security Council? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=690.96s)]
*  And to make the National Security [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=693.1600000000001s)]
*  Council a shame and humiliation as [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=695.2s)]
*  this rando blogger lists all of his [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=697.2800000000001s)]
*  aides that should be fired and [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=699.32s)]
*  then the president listens to her. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=701.12s)]
*  She's that powerful? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=703.2800000000001s)]
*  Nah. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=704.88s)]
*  There's something else [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=705.88s)]
*  behind that, right? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=706.9200000000001s)]
*  So I mean, look guys, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=708.72s)]
*  I'll give you a funny example. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=709.84s)]
*  Like Biden would never listen to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=711.5200000000001s)]
*  any left winger ever, right online. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=713.36s)]
*  Like you might listen to a New York [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=715.72s)]
*  Times reporter or [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=717.4000000000001s)]
*  MSNBC host or something. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=718.36s)]
*  But this is the equivalent of and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm almost feeling bad for [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=721.76s)]
*  Jimmy to make this analogy. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=723.5999999999999s)]
*  But if Biden called in Jimmy Dorel [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=725.2399999999999s)]
*  was like, who do you think I [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=726.92s)]
*  should fire the National Security [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=728.2399999999999s)]
*  Council? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  We would all be like, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=730.3599999999999s)]
*  what is going on? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=732.04s)]
*  I mean- [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=734.0799999999999s)]
*  Are you serious, right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=734.68s)]
*  Like that is so beyond the pale of [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=736.4799999999999s)]
*  anything that could possibly happen. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=738.4s)]
*  And I think Laura's more unhinged [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=740.7199999999999s)]
*  than Jimmy is. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=742.4799999999999s)]
*  So- I mean, look, I think that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=743.28s)]
*  there are some areas and [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  it takes a lot to say this. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=746.52s)]
*  But I think there are some areas in [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=748.16s)]
*  which Jimmy would actually be good [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=750.0s)]
*  at advising the president on foreign [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=751.88s)]
*  policy or who to keep and [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=753.92s)]
*  who to get rid of on foreign [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=755.2s)]
*  policy, especially pertaining to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=756.64s)]
*  Middle East policy. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=758.4s)]
*  Yeah, look, we might agree on [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=759.52s)]
*  Israel or some other things, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=761.28s)]
*  no problem, right? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=763.08s)]
*  I'm just giving that as like, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=764.48s)]
*  I know that on the left, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=766.36s)]
*  people would find that to be [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=767.88s)]
*  the most outrageous thing they'd [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=769.6s)]
*  ever heard. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=771.6s)]
*  And this is more outrageous than [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=772.2s)]
*  that, right? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=773.8s)]
*  So that can't be the story. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=774.68s)]
*  There's now all sorts of cover [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=776.96s)]
*  stories out there that make no [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=778.52s)]
*  sense at all. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=780.2s)]
*  One day we're going to find out, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=781.24s)]
*  but the last thing I'll say about [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=782.76s)]
*  this is, me on mainstream media is [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=784.4s)]
*  like, let's see, a blogger of [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=786.1999999999999s)]
*  course has this much power. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=787.6s)]
*  I don't question that at all, okay? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=788.8399999999999s)]
*  And then people on both sides are [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=790.48s)]
*  getting fired, but [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  it must be just an internal. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=793.0799999999999s)]
*  Guys, come on, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=795.0s)]
*  this is like Israel versus America. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=795.88s)]
*  Let's do a little digging. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=798.12s)]
*  Let's do a little investigating, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=800.52s)]
*  Let's ask some tough questions and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=801.04s)]
*  figure out what's actually going on. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=802.36s)]
*  Yeah, and so the reason we say [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=803.7199999999999s)]
*  about Dana Bash is, so look, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=805.52s)]
*  she's got an interesting career [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=807.16s)]
*  full of different things. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=808.88s)]
*  But lately, I think she's gotten [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=810.2s)]
*  entrenched into more of a pro [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=812.12s)]
*  Israel position, partly because [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=813.72s)]
*  people went to her house. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=815.5200000000001s)]
*  And I think she got mad about that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=817.0400000000001s)]
*  and dug herself in further, etc. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=819.2s)]
*  But when people like her, and [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=822.2s)]
*  it's not just about her, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=823.6400000000001s)]
*  it's just in mainstream media. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=824.88s)]
*  When they see serious people, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=826.2800000000001s)]
*  right, they mean the professionals [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=828.0400000000001s)]
*  who believe that the status quo is [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=830.2s)]
*  awesome and the establishment is [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=832.12s)]
*  the greatest thing ever. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=834.08s)]
*  And war is fantastic, and [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=835.4000000000001s)]
*  Israel should always be listened to. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=837.0400000000001s)]
*  Israel is in that list of things [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=840.16s)]
*  we always do, right? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=841.9599999999999s)]
*  And so the people who have ruined [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=843.36s)]
*  this country with the things we [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=845.4s)]
*  always do are the serious people, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=847.28s)]
*  right? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  So that's as far as their analysis [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=850.36s)]
*  goes. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=852.56s)]
*  Let's be honest, come on guys, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=853.64s)]
*  CNN New York Times, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=855.0799999999999s)]
*  you're going to do a real piece. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=856.04s)]
*  Okay, this is Israel first versus [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=857.64s)]
*  America first. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=859.0799999999999s)]
*  Everyone on the right wing knows it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  Tons of people on the left wing [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=862.4s)]
*  knows it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=863.52s)]
*  The only people who don't seem to [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=864.12s)]
*  know it is national media reporters [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=865.3199999999999s)]
*  covering the White House and [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=866.76s)]
*  Congress. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=867.8s)]
*  Come on, that's embarrassing. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=868.3199999999999s)]
*  And to be honest with you, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=869.8s)]
*  I think it's the most interesting [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=870.88s)]
*  development within the Republican [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  Party ever. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=873.92s)]
*  I mean that, ever, because- [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=874.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  Ever since I've been alive, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=876.92s)]
*  the only Republican Party I've [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=878.88s)]
*  known is the hawkish pro-war party, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=881.04s)]
*  the neoconservative party. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=883.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=886.04s)]
*  And so we'll see what happens. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=886.56s)]
*  And now all of a sudden you see [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=887.7199999999999s)]
*  this absorption of neoconservatives [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  within the Democratic Party. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=891.12s)]
*  And it should be worrying to [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=892.68s)]
*  Democratic voters, but [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=894.4s)]
*  unfortunately they're a little [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=895.76s)]
*  asleep at the wheel on that issue. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=897.68s)]
*  I can't help but say one last [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=899.4s)]
*  thing, it's amazing what [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=900.6s)]
*  the national media misses. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=901.8s)]
*  So I remember a million years ago, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  George W Bush comes out with [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  a foreign policy while he's running [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=907.0s)]
*  for president that is diametrically [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=908.92s)]
*  opposed to his dad's, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=910.88s)]
*  George H.W. Bush. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=912.04s)]
*  George H.W. Bush do not attack [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=913.4s)]
*  a country that did not attack you, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  okay? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=917.24s)]
*  Do not attack sovereign countries. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=917.76s)]
*  That was the new world order. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=919.0799999999999s)]
*  George W Bush has the exact [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=920.56s)]
*  opposite policy. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=922.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=923.24s)]
*  And they're both Republican [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=923.76s)]
*  presidents that follow one another. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=924.88s)]
*  And the press is like, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=926.72s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=927.72s)]
*  How did you not see that their [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=929.0799999999999s)]
*  policies are diametrically opposed? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=930.4399999999999s)]
*  And so right now I'm not on [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=932.64s)]
*  America first side. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=933.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm certainly not on Israel first [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=934.64s)]
*  side, but I'm deeply curious as to [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  what's going on inside the White [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=938.48s)]
*  House and the fact that there's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=940.52s)]
*  pushback against Israel first is [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=942.4s)]
*  kind of unprecedented. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=944.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=945.8s)]
*  And so, and by the way, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=946.4s)]
*  the those neocons that are moving [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=947.64s)]
*  to the Democratic Party, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=949.3199999999999s)]
*  has anyone in mainstream media even [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=950.7199999999999s)]
*  noted it? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=952.68s)]
*  The guys who started the Iraq war, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=954.0799999999999s)]
*  the ones that the Democrats said [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=956.04s)]
*  were dead set against, half of them, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=957.9599999999999s)]
*  three quarters of them are now [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=960.12s)]
*  housed inside the Democratic Party. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=961.7199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=963.7199999999999s)]
*  And you guys didn't even notice [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=964.24s)]
*  that? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=965.52s)]
*  It's just embarrassing. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=966.04s)]
*  So I want to talk about one [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=967.08s)]
*  more foreign policy related [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=982.58s)]
*  story before we go to break. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=989.1800000000001s)]
*  And this one has to do with [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=990.6s)]
*  the signing of the Minerals Deal. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=993.24s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're gonna feel. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=996.44s)]
*  I'm not telling you. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=998.08s)]
*  Because you're in no position to dictate that. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=999.08s)]
*  Remember that. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1001.12s)]
*  You're in no position to dictate what we're gonna feel. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1002.12s)]
*  President Zelensky left, leaving the minerals deal on the table. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1006.44s)]
*  Then came this surprise meeting. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1010.6s)]
*  Trump and Zelensky were meeting at the Pope's funeral last week. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1012.5400000000001s)]
*  And today, Ukrainians have heard the warmest language Washington has spoken since President [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1015.6800000000001s)]
*  Trump came to power. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1020.5200000000001s)]
*  After a long and tumultuous negotiation process, the United States and Ukraine have officially [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1023.76s)]
*  signed a minerals deal that allows the US to share future revenue from Ukraine's natural [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1029.32s)]
*  resources. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1036.4s)]
*  Now, some are kind of trying to present this as a major loss for Donald Trump since there [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1037.4s)]
*  were some important concessions that he made in getting this deal signed. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1042.36s)]
*  But I don't see it that way. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1047.28s)]
*  I actually think this is better than what was initially agreed upon between the United [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1048.76s)]
*  States and Ukraine. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1053.8799999999999s)]
*  And the reason why I say that is because Ukraine isn't gonna be fleeced the way it would have [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1054.8799999999999s)]
*  if Donald Trump insisted on the initial terms of the first deal. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1059.16s)]
*  Now, the current deal was supposed to be signed all the way, or the initial deal, I should [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1064.04s)]
*  say, was supposed to be signed all the way back in February when Trump and Zelensky had [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1068.92s)]
*  that fiery Oval Office meeting where JD Vance, unfortunately, did not help the situation [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1073.0s)]
*  and devolved further with his involvement. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1079.48s)]
*  But Trump, in that conversation, accused the Ukrainian president of being a dictator. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1083.28s)]
*  Now, last month, the agreement dubbed the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1087.44s)]
*  Fund finally came to fruition. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1093.0s)]
*  And it does create a US-controlled investment fund that would receive revenue from Ukraine's [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1095.68s)]
*  vast natural resources. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1100.6399999999999s)]
*  Right, Cenk? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1102.36s)]
*  No, so I'm curious, before I get to the deal itself and the terms within that deal, what [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1103.36s)]
*  your thoughts are. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1108.52s)]
*  So I hated that we were trying to randomly rob the Ukrainians of their natural resources [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1110.28s)]
*  before we agreed to help them broker a good ceasefire in negotiations with Russia. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1115.8s)]
*  And we made that our top priority. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1122.58s)]
*  First, we gotta get paid. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1124.1999999999998s)]
*  And one of those precious minerals is lithium, which goes into the batteries in Tesla, right? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1126.48s)]
*  So we've made a deal, but now I think I might be pretty happy with it. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1131.5s)]
*  So I'll tell you why after you get the details. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1136.6200000000001s)]
*  Okay, perfect. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1138.76s)]
*  So just to give you a few details about this deal itself, Ukraine controls more than 100 [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1139.76s)]
*  major deposits of critical minerals. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1145.44s)]
*  And that's according to a study by the Keefe School of Economics, along with modest oil [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1148.16s)]
*  and natural gas reserves. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1152.8s)]
*  So that's what Donald Trump has been eyeing. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1154.48s)]
*  And what you're about to hear are some of the more granular details about the deal itself. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1157.3600000000001s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1162.88s)]
*  That centers on US access to Ukraine's vast resources under its soil. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1163.88s)]
*  That includes oil and gas, but along with critical raw materials, that's like graphite, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1169.38s)]
*  titanium and uranium for aerospace and technology. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1174.1200000000001s)]
*  Funds from this deal would go towards paying the US for future military aid and to establish [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1177.72s)]
*  a joint fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1183.68s)]
*  So you get a sense of how Donald Trump made some concessions based on what was said in [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1188.68s)]
*  that video, that CBS report. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1193.28s)]
*  Now it is significantly watered down from what Trump originally was demanding. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1195.28s)]
*  So for instance, he was initially demanding $500 billion or a $500 billion share of Ukraine's [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1199.2s)]
*  rare earths and other minerals in exchange for military aid that we've provided to Keefe. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1205.3400000000001s)]
*  But this deal actually gives no guarantees of profit. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1213.06s)]
*  On top of that, he also said that he wanted Ukraine to use its mineral wealth to repay [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1217.2s)]
*  the United States for military aid that has already been given to Ukraine. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1224.58s)]
*  However, he has reneged on that, right? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1228.4199999999998s)]
*  Or he is no longer insisting on that. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1230.3799999999999s)]
*  The minerals deal will help pay the United States for future military investment into [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1232.8999999999999s)]
*  or help for Ukraine to beat off or defend itself against Russia. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1239.26s)]
*  But there's more. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1245.18s)]
*  So although the agreement does not treat past aid to Ukraine as debt that the country needs [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1246.86s)]
*  to repay, it does say that future military aid, including weapons and training, will [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1253.3999999999999s)]
*  be treated as a US contribution to the fund. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1256.94s)]
*  Meaning that Ukraine will need to match future aid with resource wealth. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1259.98s)]
*  And in a post on Telegram, Ukraine's prime minister wrote that the two countries would [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1265.26s)]
*  have equal voting rights over the fund and that Ukraine would retain full control over [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1269.8200000000002s)]
*  its subsoil infrastructure and natural resources. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1275.28s)]
*  So this agreement also appears to keep open the possibility for Ukraine to join the European [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1279.5600000000002s)]
*  Union. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1287.78s)]
*  But look, we have to also be clear about one thing. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1289.3600000000001s)]
*  This deal really means nothing if Donald Trump can't convince Vladimir Putin to end the war. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1292.76s)]
*  And right now, there's no indication that Putin and Russia have any intention to end [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1299.8799999999999s)]
*  the war. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1305.28s)]
*  So it really does hinge on Russia. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1306.34s)]
*  However, before I go to you, Cenk, I just wanna note that Trump has changed his rhetoric [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1309.04s)]
*  a little bit when it comes to Russia. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1314.4s)]
*  I wanna show you that video after we hear from Cenk. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1316.2s)]
*  Yeah, so look, on this deal, the devil's in the details. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1318.92s)]
*  And so CNN is reporting that it doesn't really have bite. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1325.04s)]
*  That it's going to be many decades from now when they're actually extracting those minerals. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1329.8799999999999s)]
*  And that there's enough leeway in the deal for the Ukrainians to be able to basically [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1334.8s)]
*  change the terms, get out of it, etc. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1341.24s)]
*  If that's true, then it's a face saving measure for Trump and we're moving forward to actually [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1344.02s)]
*  dealing with the ceasefire. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1350.94s)]
*  That would be great news, okay? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1352.78s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1354.42s)]
*  So if it turns out we really are holding them hostage and taking their state and natural [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1355.54s)]
*  resources, etc. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1362.62s)]
*  Let's be honest, that would be America 101, right? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1364.54s)]
*  And we're back to doing that kind of nonsense for Trump and his donors, etc. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1368.22s)]
*  But if the reporting is accurate, it's a vague enough deal and we move forward, great, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1372.7s)]
*  then I'm super happy with it. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1378.22s)]
*  Now there's no mention of a US security guarantee in the text of the deal. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1379.78s)]
*  However, as I mentioned earlier, the Trump administration appears to have changed its [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1383.6200000000001s)]
*  rhetoric a little bit as it pertains to Russia. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1387.3600000000001s)]
*  So let me give you a little taste of that. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1390.82s)]
*  Today's agreement signals clearly to Russian leadership that the Trump administration is [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1394.38s)]
*  committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine over [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1400.06s)]
*  the long term. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1406.46s)]
*  It's time for this cruel and senseless war to end. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1408.08s)]
*  The killing must stop. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1412.2s)]
*  And look, there are a lot of kinks that still need to be worked out, including the fact [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1416.02s)]
*  that Ukraine's parliament still has to ratify the agreement. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1420.26s)]
*  But I think the good news here is that Trump has kind of backed off of this idea of essentially [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1425.78s)]
*  fleecing Ukraine with nothing in return. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1430.5s)]
*  That was the initial plan. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1435.14s)]
*  Yes, there's a couple other good things. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1436.14s)]
*  By the way, let's note that Elon Musk is on his way out of the White House, and all of [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1438.02s)]
*  a sudden the minerals become less important. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1442.8600000000001s)]
*  Okay, so I don't know that those are connected, but it is an interesting note. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1445.1000000000001s)]
*  All right, now there are parts in the deal that clearly say Russian aggression and how [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1448.98s)]
*  the Ukrainians would buy weapons from the US and that money from the fund would be used [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1455.38s)]
*  to pay for those. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1460.74s)]
*  So that is in writing, the US saying the Russians are the bad guys and we might sell more weapons [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1462.36s)]
*  to the Ukrainians. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1467.38s)]
*  So that's the second piece of good news here because that's basically Trump administration [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1468.46s)]
*  saying, Vladimir, stop. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1472.54s)]
*  Okay, so that's what he wrote in a true social post. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1475.78s)]
*  And this is him actually carrying that out, which is much more important than the true [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1478.9399999999998s)]
*  social post, right? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1483.1399999999999s)]
*  So I wonder if that creates enough leverage to get Putin to reenter the negotiations in [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1484.8999999999999s)]
*  a serious way. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1490.26s)]
*  If it does, terrific. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1491.6599999999999s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1492.6599999999999s)]
*  But when we come back, I want to stay on the topic of foreign policy or what's happening [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1494.82s)]
*  internationally. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1499.86s)]
*  We're gonna talk a little bit about the latest in Gaza, including the starvation tactics [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1500.86s)]
*  that are being waged against the Palestinian people and the insane amount of land that [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1505.6599999999999s)]
*  Israel is now currently occupying in Gaza. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1510.82s)]
*  That and more coming up, don't miss it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1513.36s)]
*  All right, back on TYT, Cenk, Ana, and Lady AF, thank you for gifting 10 memberships [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1530.86s)]
*  on YouTube. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1538.26s)]
*  You're awesome as usual. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1539.26s)]
*  Casper. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1540.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, there's some pretty big updates out of Gaza that I wanna share with you all, including [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1541.6599999999999s)]
*  how much land Israel is currently occupying in the Gaza Strip. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1546.5s)]
*  So let's get to those details. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1550.02s)]
*  In the six weeks since Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas, the Israeli Defense Forces have [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1551.4599999999998s)]
*  basically drastically altered Gaza's map in order to take control, complete control of [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1558.18s)]
*  70% of Palestinian territory. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1564.66s)]
*  So I'm gonna show you this map so you can visualize exactly what I'm talking about here. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1567.74s)]
*  This map was put together by the Washington Post. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1572.3400000000001s)]
*  And if you look at it, and as you can see from this map, which uses data from the Israeli [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1574.66s)]
*  Defense Forces, all the shaded areas represent parts of Gaza that Palestinians are now barred [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1579.14s)]
*  from being in. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1586.26s)]
*  So the darker shading indicates areas in Gaza where Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1588.02s)]
*  The lighter shading represents areas that are considered military red zones, where Palestinians [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1593.78s)]
*  will literally be killed on the spot if they enter. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1600.3s)]
*  Now, you might be asking yourself, how is that different from other parts of the Gaza [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1603.58s)]
*  Strip? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1607.46s)]
*  And the answer is, I guess it gives the IDF a little more justification in their eyes [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1608.46s)]
*  to just indiscriminately kill people. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1614.02s)]
*  But that is happening throughout the entirety of the Gaza Strip. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1617.02s)]
*  Let's be clear about that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1619.58s)]
*  In total, the shaded areas make up 68% of the Gaza Strip, Cenk. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1620.86s)]
*  Yeah, but no, this is about self-defense. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1626.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1628.9s)]
*  Of an attack that happened literally years ago. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1629.9s)]
*  It happened in the year 2023. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1632.82s)]
*  We're in the middle of the year of 2025. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1633.82s)]
*  And golly gee, did I occupy 70% of Gaza? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1638.3799999999999s)]
*  Do I happen to have all their land and I'm squishing them all into a tiny little place [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1642.7s)]
*  where then I'm gonna push them out and take it all while I'm doing self-defense? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1646.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1650.6999999999998s)]
*  So look guys, I don't know when the Israeli supporters are gonna come out and apologize. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1652.78s)]
*  Cuz they said it was anti-Semitic to suggest that Israel would occupy Gaza. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1657.58s)]
*  Well here we are at 70% occupation. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1662.5s)]
*  Right, so- [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1664.1s)]
*  Well, those are the same people who are gonna argue that you're anti-Semitic for making [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1665.1s)]
*  the point you just made. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1667.78s)]
*  So it's better to just ignore those folks because they're not arguing in good faith [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1668.78s)]
*  at all. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1672.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1673.2199999999998s)]
*  So okay, it was always about land. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1674.2199999999998s)]
*  And that's what this is about. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1675.88s)]
*  It isn't about the hostages. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1676.88s)]
*  It isn't about self-defense. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1677.88s)]
*  It's about stealing that land which they're in the middle of doing now. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1678.88s)]
*  But what's much worse is how they're starving the children to death. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1682.6000000000001s)]
*  So let's tell you about that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1686.48s)]
*  I do wanna tell you about that. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1687.6000000000001s)]
*  So I should note that recent evacuation orders, according to the Washington Post, have covered [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1688.96s)]
*  border areas and population centers that have displaced more than 420,000 people according [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1694.1000000000001s)]
*  to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1699.92s)]
*  Now one area of the Gaza Strip that has been occupied significantly by the IDF is the border [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1704.36s)]
*  area between Gaza and Egypt. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1712.84s)]
*  And the Rafa border, as it was called, was the area in which humanitarian aid trucks [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1717.0s)]
*  were able to come into the Gaza Strip to provide some humanitarian relief to the Palestinian [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1722.32s)]
*  civilians who are currently trapped in Gaza. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1727.8s)]
*  But now there is a complete siege on the Gaza Strip because of the fact that the IDF has [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1731.98s)]
*  complete control of the Rafa border crossing and the Philadelphia corridor. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1737.98s)]
*  So basically Israel has refused to allow any humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip for months, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1743.78s)]
*  for months, okay? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1750.34s)]
*  So for nearly two months, Israel has carried out a total siege of Gaza, refusing to allow [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1751.42s)]
*  in a single truck of humanitarian aid or commercial goods. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1757.1399999999999s)]
*  The longest period Israel has imposed such a total blockade. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1761.6599999999999s)]
*  They're using this as a weapon of war. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1766.1399999999999s)]
*  Let's just be clear about that. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1768.22s)]
*  Of course, that violates international law. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1769.58s)]
*  They're committing war crimes by doing this. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1772.02s)]
*  But since Israel is backed by the military superpower, the United States, they're able [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1774.44s)]
*  to do whatever they want with impunity. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1780.1399999999999s)]
*  So the World Food Program announced this week that its warehouses are now barren. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1782.74s)]
*  The soup kitchens that are still running are severely rationing their last stocks. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1787.26s)]
*  And what little food remains in Gaza's markets is now being sold for exorbitant prices that [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1793.1000000000001s)]
*  most cannot afford. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1798.5800000000002s)]
*  A simple bag of flour now costs the equivalent of $100. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1799.5800000000002s)]
*  Cases of acute child malnutrition in Gaza are rapidly rising. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1804.42s)]
*  One of the telltale signs of impending famine, nearly 3,700 children were diagnosed last [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1809.52s)]
*  month, an 82% increase from February according to the United Nations. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1815.8s)]
*  And in some ways, the Trump administration has been worse than the Biden administration. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1822.6s)]
*  Not by many ways, but by this particular way. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1829.3799999999999s)]
*  Biden at least paid lip service to allowing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1832.68s)]
*  Now he didn't really use punishment or any leverage against Israel when they refused [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1837.92s)]
*  to do so. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1842.0s)]
*  In the case of the Trump administration, they appear to be completely on board with this [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1843.04s)]
*  siege. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1848.0s)]
*  In fact, Mike Huckabee, the demonic scourge on America and its global reputation, is unfortunately [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1849.0s)]
*  now the US ambassador to Israel. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1854.8600000000001s)]
*  And get a load of this piece of garbage. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1857.1200000000001s)]
*  Dr. Hanan Balkhi, who is the regional coordinator for the WHO for the Eastern Mediterranean [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1860.1200000000001s)]
*  region called upon me to put more pressure on Israel to bring humanitarian aid to the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1866.0s)]
*  people of Gaza. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1872.96s)]
*  I appreciate the message from Dr. Balkhi. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1874.3200000000002s)]
*  And today, what I would like to suggest is that we work together on putting the pressure [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1877.78s)]
*  where it really belongs on Hamas. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1882.24s)]
*  To give us the opportunity to open up those humanitarian channels. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1885.5s)]
*  So we call upon Hamas to sign an agreement so that humanitarian aid can flow into Gaza [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1889.42s)]
*  to the people who desperately need it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1897.0s)]
*  When that happens and hostages are released, which is an urgent matter for all of us, then [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1900.26s)]
*  we hope that that humanitarian aid will flow. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1906.52s)]
*  I wanna be clear, using starvation as a weapon of war, which is what Huckabee very clearly [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1911.9399999999998s)]
*  and brazenly was advocating for in that video, is a war crime. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1918.6s)]
*  Also, it's abundantly clear from Netanyahu himself, the Prime Minister of Israel, that [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1922.12s)]
*  getting the hostages back is not the priority here. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1926.34s)]
*  Let me give you his direct statement, verbatim. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1928.9799999999998s)]
*  We have many objectives, many goals in this war. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1931.78s)]
*  We wanna bring back all of our hostages. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1934.4599999999998s)]
*  That is a very important goal. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1936.4599999999998s)]
*  In war, there is a supreme objective, and that supreme objective is victory over our [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1938.28s)]
*  enemies, and that is what we will achieve. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1944.48s)]
*  In other words, who gives a damn about the hostages? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1946.84s)]
*  We wanna take over Gaza, and we're gonna do that by any means necessary. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1950.16s)]
*  Cenk. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1953.28s)]
*  By the way, the hostages might also be starving to death right now. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1954.28s)]
*  Yeah, cuz they don't care. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1957.36s)]
*  There's no food in Gaza, so how are the hostages gonna eat? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1959.2s)]
*  So okay, but they don't care about the hostages at all. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1963.8799999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu couldn't care less. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1966.6s)]
*  He's like, I'm about to steal all of Gaza. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1968.08s)]
*  You think I care about 24 or 59 Israeli lives? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1970.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't care about them. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1974.76s)]
*  If I cared about them, I wouldn't have let the hostages there. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1975.76s)]
*  I wouldn't have dropped bombs on their heads. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1977.6799999999998s)]
*  They were in the buildings I was dropping the bombs on. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1979.36s)]
*  We know the released hostages said, yeah, Israel was dropping bombs on us. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1981.3799999999999s)]
*  So how much clearer does Netanyahu have to make it? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1986.6399999999999s)]
*  He doesn't give a damn about the hostages. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1989.4399999999998s)]
*  He doesn't care about anybody except me, me, me, me, me. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1992.1599999999999s)]
*  If I step down, I'll have corruption charges against me. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1995.56s)]
*  I might go to prison, I'll be out of power. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=1998.6799999999998s)]
*  And the way I stay in power is endless war, and endless death and destruction. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2000.3999999999999s)]
*  He's one of the worst terrorists of my lifetime. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2005.04s)]
*  That is an indisputable fact. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2007.6399999999999s)]
*  If you say there's only two excuses that they ever make, which is no, if a government kills [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2009.72s)]
*  children and slaughters innocent people on purpose, it doesn't count. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2016.7s)]
*  It doesn't count. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2021.28s)]
*  Only if the powerless do it, we call it terrorism, right? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2022.28s)]
*  But if a government does it, then it's wonderful state action, right? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2025.06s)]
*  The second excuse is Mahakabe's excuse. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2027.94s)]
*  Hamas made us do it. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2030.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2031.78s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2032.78s)]
*  Okay, so guys, I'm asking you whether you're right wing, left wing, whatever wing you're [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2033.78s)]
*  in, right? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2036.7s)]
*  Is there any force on Earth that can get you to starve 3,700 children to death? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2037.7s)]
*  Nope. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2043.58s)]
*  Cuz right now those kids who were diagnosed with acute child malnutrition last month are [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2044.58s)]
*  about to die. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2050.66s)]
*  Like this CNN had a story, one of the kids, that's five years old, is down to 20 pounds. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2052.7s)]
*  Taking clothes on and off causes them pain cuz every touch causes them pain cuz he's [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2057.5s)]
*  skin and bones. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2062.22s)]
*  They look like they're kids out of the Holocaust. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2063.22s)]
*  He's supposed to, at this point in his life as a five year old, weigh at least 40 pounds. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2064.8599999999997s)]
*  And there's a mom, this CNN talked to, who's going through a flower that is infested with [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2071.02s)]
*  bugs and pests, etc. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2078.7799999999997s)]
*  She's trying to filter it, filter it, filter it, filter it, cuz there's literally no food [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2080.98s)]
*  left, right? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2084.7000000000003s)]
*  And so she gives it to her kids after baking it, they throw up, but she's like, what am [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2085.7000000000003s)]
*  I gonna do? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2089.38s)]
*  There's literally no food left and they're starving to death. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2090.38s)]
*  For two months, they haven't let food in there. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2093.2200000000003s)]
*  Two months, there's no food. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2096.18s)]
*  Mass starvation is collective punishment. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2099.5s)]
*  It's one of the worst acts of terrorism you could do. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2104.7000000000003s)]
*  And so, look, so is Netanyahu a war criminal and a terrorist? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2107.9s)]
*  Obviously, Ben Gavir, obviously, Smotrich, obviously. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2112.7000000000003s)]
*  They should spend the rest of their life in the Hague. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2116.1s)]
*  That is so painfully obvious to every human being on Earth other than American government [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2118.48s)]
*  officials and supporters of Israel, period. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2125.42s)]
*  They're like, no, not enough, not enough, right? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2128.78s)]
*  And don't tell me that you're against Netanyahu and sit on your ass and do nothing, right? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2131.3s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2136.1800000000003s)]
*  And then you come out and said, this goddamn Israeli government doesn't represent me. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2137.18s)]
*  It's heartless, it's inhumane, it's disgusting. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2141.46s)]
*  And I can't believe that it's pretending to represent Jews across the world. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2144.54s)]
*  How dare you call this a Jewish state and do this kind of monstrosity? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2148.3799999999997s)]
*  That's how I would react, that's how I do react when Erdogan does 1% of this, I lose [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2153.46s)]
*  it because it's not just the victims of Erdogan, it's how it makes all Turks look. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2157.74s)]
*  How does it make Turkey look or all Turks across the world? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2165.54s)]
*  And I'm enraged by what he does. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2169.7200000000003s)]
*  Now Netanyahu does 10,000 times worse. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2172.42s)]
*  Now Israel, Israel, Israel, Israel. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2176.1800000000003s)]
*  Israel is so important that you could just slaughter those poor people. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2178.98s)]
*  Already over 15 to 20,000 kids dead, when is it gonna be enough? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2185.1400000000003s)]
*  So again, I come back to you guys. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2189.7000000000003s)]
*  I asked you, is there any force on Earth, even if they kidnapped your family? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2191.66s)]
*  Imagine how enraged you'd be, how enraged? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2195.9s)]
*  I understand that rage. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2198.42s)]
*  So I'm giving you the maximum hypothetical, they kidnapped your family. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2199.94s)]
*  Would you murder 3,700 kids? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2205.22s)]
*  If you say yes, there's something deeply wrong with you. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2209.8s)]
*  Yeah, and to the credit, hold on. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2213.42s)]
*  And by the way, that's the ones that are being starved to death now, let alone the 15,000 [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2214.78s)]
*  that are already in the grave. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2218.86s)]
*  Don't tell me Hamas made you do it. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2220.66s)]
*  You are choosing to do that. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2222.8199999999997s)]
*  You are choosing, Hamas killed 36 kids. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2225.2599999999998s)]
*  You've now killed 15,000. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2228.58s)]
*  Hamas didn't make you do that. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2229.58s)]
*  Netanyahu chose to do that cuz he's one of the worst terrorists of our lifetimes. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2231.54s)]
*  I just, final thing I'll say about this. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2236.3399999999997s)]
*  Even the family members of the hostages don't want this. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2239.3399999999997s)]
*  And I give them a tremendous amount of credit for continuing to speak out, continuing to [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2242.42s)]
*  protest the Israeli government and Netanyahu. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2246.54s)]
*  Because that shows their deep level of humanity to want this war to end, to want the slaughter [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2250.22s)]
*  to end. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2256.32s)]
*  Because by the way, they also know that's the only way to actually get their family [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2258.06s)]
*  members back. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2261.12s)]
*  But that's not the priority for Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2262.56s)]
*  We gotta take a break. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2264.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay, no, I'm gonna say one more thing. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2265.7799999999997s)]
*  So the EU and the entire world is against this, right? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2267.7s)]
*  There's only one country left supporting Israel, and that's America. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2270.62s)]
*  And Mike Huckabee is a Christian Zionist lunatic. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2273.94s)]
*  He believes that if Israel murders enough Muslims in that area, that Jesus will come [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2276.94s)]
*  back and murder the rest of us and kill at least 7 billion people. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2281.52s)]
*  So that's the lunatic, the escaped mental asylum patient that we have as ambassador [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2285.46s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2290.1600000000003s)]
*  So he's enjoying the slaughter of those innocent people while pretending to be a Christian. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2291.2000000000003s)]
*  And if you think that represents Christianity, Jesus, you have a terrible, terrible, terrible [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2297.42s)]
*  view of Christianity. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2302.54s)]
*  I don't think it does. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2303.54s)]
*  So these monsters are pretending to represent Christians and Jews and America and Israel. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2304.74s)]
*  So there's nothing that America can do because our politicians are the most corrupt people [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2311.44s)]
*  on Earth. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2315.82s)]
*  So the American voters are already 100%, not 100%, but a minimum 80% against what's happening [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2316.94s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2323.3s)]
*  But 80% of American voters don't matter at all. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2324.4s)]
*  The only thing that matters is corruption and money for the greedy asses in Washington, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2327.38s)]
*  okay? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2332.5s)]
*  So that's why I say this message to good people in Israel. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2333.5s)]
*  You are literally the only people on Earth that could stop the slaughter. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2337.5s)]
*  If you don't get Netanyahu out, what you're saying is, I'm good with the slaughter. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2342.56s)]
*  We're gonna starve children to death? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2348.54s)]
*  That's what Israel stands for now. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2350.34s)]
*  That's not my decision to make. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2353.5s)]
*  That's your decision to make, and you haven't, I mean, in a sense, you've already made it, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2355.16s)]
*  but you couldn't reverse that decision. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2358.74s)]
*  You can say, this monster doesn't represent us, and we're not gonna starve those children [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2360.82s)]
*  to death. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2364.7400000000002s)]
*  Israel, it's your choice. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2365.7400000000002s)]
*  Don't come crying later and talk about BS antisemitism. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2367.46s)]
*  After you make that decision, if you murder those kids, that's on you. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2371.46s)]
*  That's not on anyone else. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2377.06s)]
*  So turn around right now, for God's sake, turn around. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2379.1400000000003s)]
*  If you don't turn around, don't come crying later about how people don't like you. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2382.26s)]
*  Why, why? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2386.5800000000004s)]
*  We murdered tens of thousands of children. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2387.86s)]
*  We starved human beings to death. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2390.1s)]
*  Gee, I wonder why people don't like us. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2391.94s)]
*  Wow, that's so complicated. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2394.22s)]
*  Let me try to figure it out. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2395.98s)]
*  No, that's why, turn around. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2397.46s)]
*  I still believe you can turn around. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2399.3399999999997s)]
*  I hope I'm right. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2401.42s)]
*  I hope that Israel finds its moral core and ends this despicable monstrosity. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2402.42s)]
*  Young Turks. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2409.5s)]
*  All right, back on TYT, Jake and Anna with you guys. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2420.1s)]
*  I'm one of my new favorite guys. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2432.3399999999997s)]
*  Johnny Diamond gifted 20 memberships on YouTube. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2433.58s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2436.2999999999997s)]
*  I'll read your super chat later in the show. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2436.8199999999997s)]
*  Anna. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2438.58s)]
*  That's a great name, by the way, Johnny Diamond. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2439.1s)]
*  I like that. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2440.8199999999997s)]
*  It's actually John Diamond, but I like to call him Johnny Diamond. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2441.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Johnny. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2443.62s)]
*  Because it sounds even better. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2444.22s)]
*  I like it too. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2445.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2445.66s)]
*  All right, we gotta talk about this insane convo that happened on Tucker Carlson's [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2446.2599999999998s)]
*  podcast. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2450.06s)]
*  I think that if you can't defend yourself as a nation or if you can't survive without [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2450.74s)]
*  being propped up by another government, say ours, then you shouldn't exist as a country. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2455.7799999999997s)]
*  That's just the way of the world. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2462.74s)]
*  So- Wait, wait, wait. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2464.22s)]
*  If you can't exist without being propped up by another government, say ours, you shouldn't exist. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2465.98s)]
*  Israel cannot exist without being propped up by the United States. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2472.22s)]
*  You think so? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2476.66s)]
*  Its nuclear program came from the United States, its weapons come from the United States, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2478.42s)]
*  its economy is supported by the United States. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2481.54s)]
*  Well, that was a fascinating conversation that took place on Tucker Carlson's podcast. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2485.94s)]
*  Now, Tucker Carlson sat down with Matt Walsh, who has a show on the Daily Wire, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2490.26s)]
*  the same Daily Wire that fired Candace Owens for her critical statements on Israel. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2496.66s)]
*  Which is fascinating. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2502.34s)]
*  And I'm about to give you some more context into this convo. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2503.78s)]
*  But before I do, I just wanna be fair because Matt Walsh seems to believe that Israel would [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2507.4199999999996s)]
*  exist even without US aid. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2513.4199999999996s)]
*  And I've seen some stuff on social media where Israeli officials are like, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2516.9399999999996s)]
*  we don't need US aid. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2520.4599999999996s)]
*  Okay, then can we stop giving you billions of dollars every year? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2521.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, deal, deal. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2526.54s)]
*  Where do I sign that deal? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2528.8599999999997s)]
*  But no, Israel will take another $300 billion from us because all of our politicians are crooks, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2530.8999999999996s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2536.5s)]
*  Don't tell me otherwise, we saw the Democrats, they were giant crooks and gave them endless [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2538.2200000000003s)]
*  money, a blank check to slaughter and genocide and ethnically cleanse Gaza. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2543.98s)]
*  Then we see Trump come in and do worse and say, why don't we ethnically cleanse them for you and [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2547.9s)]
*  deal with your exploded bombs? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2553.66s)]
*  Why don't American soldiers die instead of Israeli soldiers, etc, right? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2554.94s)]
*  Why don't we occupy Gaza for you? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2559.34s)]
*  So we see what's happening here. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2561.26s)]
*  But that's not the interesting part here. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2563.18s)]
*  Because that we already knew that our politicians are the biggest crooks in the world and serve [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2565.02s)]
*  Israel, okay? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2568.78s)]
*  What's interesting is Matt Walsh working for Ben Shapiro, talking about how maybe Israel [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2570.2200000000003s)]
*  shouldn't exist if they're going to keep taking money from us. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2575.9s)]
*  So look, for Matt Walsh, and I listened to the entirety of this conversation, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2578.78s)]
*  the whole podcast episode, and I thought it was interesting. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2583.82s)]
*  There was a lot I disagreed with. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2586.14s)]
*  But when it came to this particular topic, Matt Walsh isn't really saying things because he has [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2587.42s)]
*  something against Israel or he's ideologically opposed to Israel. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2593.9s)]
*  He is genuinely opposed to us using our resources on any foreign government, including Israel. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2598.54s)]
*  So with that in mind, let's give you some more context in regard to this conversation. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2606.94s)]
*  I wanna give you a fuller look at how this went down. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2611.5s)]
*  Israel cannot exist without being propped up by the United States. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2614.2200000000003s)]
*  You think so? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2619.34s)]
*  Its nuclear program came from the United States, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2620.94s)]
*  its weapons come from the United States, its economies supported by the United States. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2622.78s)]
*  I'm not talking Israel, I'm just saying in point of fact, I think that's true. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2625.5800000000004s)]
*  And I mean, Israel thinks it's true, or they wouldn't have armies of lobbyists and influencers [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2629.42s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2634.2200000000003s)]
*  Bibi wouldn't have shown up twice in the past three months. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2634.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, from my perspective, it seems like they can handle themselves quite fine. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2637.34s)]
*  But any country, if there is any country out there that fundamentally cannot exist without being [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2645.9s)]
*  subsidized by American taxpayers, then not only should that country not exist, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2656.94s)]
*  but that country already does not exist. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2662.46s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2666.38s)]
*  It's not really a country. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2667.5s)]
*  Right, no. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2668.54s)]
*  It's- And unless we wanna go back to the old way, which was back in the bad old days, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2669.1s)]
*  when we did real empires, if you wanna just be conquered and you're gonna be a vassal state [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2676.86s)]
*  of ours, and we're gonna sort of own you, then that's one system. But we don't really do that, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2685.74s)]
*  at least not directly anymore. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2691.74s)]
*  So really interesting perspective from Matt Walsh. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2693.02s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, there's two different issues here. Number one, I made a super bold prediction [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2700.38s)]
*  at the beginning of the Trump term that the right wing would turn on Israel. And people thought I [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2707.02s)]
*  was just totally nuts. The right wing has supported Israel way more historically here in the US than [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2711.18s)]
*  the left wing. There's Tucker Carlson and Matt Walsh talking about how either Israel should stop [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2716.62s)]
*  taking money from us or they shouldn't exist. It is incredible. No left winger has said anything [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2722.3s)]
*  like that. The right is now outflanking us on F these guys. Why do they keep taking our money [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2728.2200000000003s)]
*  and keep doing these? Look, I don't know how much they care about the outrageous things that Israel's [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2734.46s)]
*  doing. Matt Walsh doesn't care at all. It's like, yeah. But they're outraged by the 300 [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2738.54s)]
*  billion we're already missing. And by the way, I mean, later we're gonna talk about Patrick [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2743.1800000000003s)]
*  but David and his whole crew giving pretty bad grace to Trump. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2747.02s)]
*  And one of the things that they're most pissed about is where's Epstein files? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2750.3s)]
*  And people are now talking and then another witness committed suicide. Interesting, interesting. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2755.58s)]
*  And people are beginning to wonder what the hell is going on here? Who's the vassal state of who? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2761.9s)]
*  Right? Are we sure that Israel's our vassal state or are we their vassal state? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2767.34s)]
*  Even though we're giving them the billions. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2772.22s)]
*  Right, I know. Look, they shut down any conversation about this for 50 years in America. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2773.82s)]
*  And they just all they would do is they believe you're racist, a bigot, an anti-Semite or whatever, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2779.5800000000004s)]
*  right? But who took 300 billion from whom? And for what reason, right? So these are factual [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2784.06s)]
*  questions. Are facts anti-Semitic? So 300 billion in adjusted inflation dollars went from the US to [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2793.5800000000004s)]
*  Israel. Here's what came back, absolutely nothing. And when you say, hey, well, you didn't give us [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2801.18s)]
*  any money, you didn't give us any tangible things. What did you give us? They say, we gave you [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2806.2999999999997s)]
*  intelligence. Intelligence on what? Which of our enemies to kill? Wow, thank you so much. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2811.8199999999997s)]
*  I didn't know you were that helpful. Okay, so now there's a second issue, which is, hey, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2817.98s)]
*  what's going on at the Daily Y? Hold on that, hold on that. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2822.94s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, because I do wanna go to one more video from this exchange between Walsh and Tucker [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2825.3399999999997s)]
*  Carlson. Now, Tucker Carlson does most of the speaking here because he wants to talk about what [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2830.62s)]
*  he loathes about some Trump voters in the United States. And Walsh seems to agree with him. Let's [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2835.66s)]
*  take a look. It's all Trump voters, right? In my feed. They're yelling at each other over [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2842.54s)]
*  mostly about Israel, but also about Ukraine, but about foreign countries. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2850.14s)]
*  That's what they're mad at. I mean, they're totally obsessed. And by the way, I think it's [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2854.14s)]
*  legitimate to have views on all four. I've got a million views on a million different foreign [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2859.26s)]
*  countries, including those two. But that's their overriding concern. It does seem, I hate the word [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2862.3s)]
*  up, but it does seem like by design, someone has sapped the vital energy from Trump's voting base [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2868.2200000000003s)]
*  by convincing them that what's happening in these foreign countries is more important than what's [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2874.94s)]
*  happening in their own. That's what I see. Do you see this? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2879.26s)]
*  I do see it. And I don't understand it. I don't understand why, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2882.94s)]
*  how do we get to a point where the dominant conversation in this country [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2891.02s)]
*  is about what's happening in other countries? I don't understand it. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2898.3s)]
*  Now, I just wanna say that the rest of this podcast episode touched on all sorts of issues, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2902.22s)]
*  and they have all sorts of takes that I am just diametrically opposed to, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2910.54s)]
*  including criticism of gay marriage, all that kind of stuff, social conservatism that I'm not on board [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2915.02s)]
*  with at all. But I'm able to look at this conversation on a case by case basis, issue by [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2920.54s)]
*  issue basis, and say Tucker Carlson and Walsh are absolutely right in the video clip that we [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2927.18s)]
*  just showed you. How can you on one hand argue that you are voting in favor of an America First [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2934.46s)]
*  Agenda, and then turn around and passionately argue in favor of us not only giving foreign [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2939.8999999999996s)]
*  countries our resources, more importantly, argue in favor of us carrying out a war on behalf of [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2947.8999999999996s)]
*  the foreign country? Which of course in this context is potentially going to war with Iran [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2955.18s)]
*  on behalf of Israel, something that Tucker Carlson to his credit is very much against doing. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2960.22s)]
*  Yeah, so if you say, hey, are you willing to ally with Tucker Carlson on preventing a war with Iran? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2964.8599999999997s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2970.7s)]
*  Of course I am. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2971.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2972.2999999999997s)]
*  No, let's go to war with Iran because I hate Tucker too much. I mean, what kind of a weirdo [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2974.22s)]
*  egomaniac would think like that? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2979.5s)]
*  There's a lot of people out there like that, unfortunately. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2981.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, actually, okay, I shouldn't name names. Okay, but so a lot of our members are writing, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2982.54s)]
*  and this guy's got a funny name. We read him all the time during the social breaks. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2989.34s)]
*  Janks left, tries up and furious out his handle on tyt.com. And he said, I can't believe I agreed [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2992.54s)]
*  with Tuck Tuck on something marked this day. But tons of people are writing in like that. Why? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=2997.7400000000002s)]
*  Because we're now opening our minds. Before it was tribalism, right? If you disagree with someone, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3002.06s)]
*  you have to disagree 100%. But wait a minute, what if they agree with you? Do you still have [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3007.66s)]
*  to disagree 100%? And yet the tribalists say yes. If they have your position, you should flip your [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3011.34s)]
*  position to be the opposite one just so you could oppose them. Okay, all right, if you want to be [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3016.86s)]
*  a maniac, that's your business, not my business, okay? So I can disagree with everything else [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3021.82s)]
*  Tucker Carlson says and agree with this, okay? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3026.1400000000003s)]
*  I know you want to get to Daily Wire, but I have to show you two more videos because [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3029.34s)]
*  it's specifically about Ben Shapiro. So that does it for the Matt Walsh Tucker Carlson part of this [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3032.38s)]
*  conversation and it is relevant because Matt Walsh is still at the Daily Wire. Now putting [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3038.78s)]
*  that aside, before that conversation went down, Tucker Carlson went on Megyn Kelly's podcast [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3042.86s)]
*  and touched on some of the criticism that he's been dealing with [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3049.98s)]
*  coming from Ben Shapiro himself. Let's get into it. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3054.5400000000004s)]
*  I'm just looking at it from an American perspective. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3057.42s)]
*  I don't want my country to be further weakened and my fellow citizens to die yet again. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3061.5800000000004s)]
*  My federal treasury to be drained yet again on behalf of an idea that's clearly stupid. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3068.06s)]
*  I think it's important to say, wait a second, is this a good idea? Can we actually do what you say [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3074.22s)]
*  we can do? For doing that, I have been attacked as a tool of Iran. I'm a freaking Episcopalian. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3078.62s)]
*  I am not Shiite as a tool of Qatar. It's like one of our closest allies in the world. The largest [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3085.66s)]
*  American air base in the Middle East is in Qatar. They're a close ally of ours and all of a sudden [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3091.02s)]
*  it's like, you're taking Qatari money. I've never taken a dollar from any government. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3096.38s)]
*  I mean, are you joking? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3101.9s)]
*  So Tucker Carlson has been accused of taking Qatari money because of his criticism of Israel. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3102.94s)]
*  Him being willing to question whether or not it is a good idea to go to war with Iran. And one [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3109.34s)]
*  of the main people who's been making these arguments against Tucker Carlson happens to be Ben [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3115.1800000000003s)]
*  Shapiro, who of course is a staunch defender of Israel. So he addresses that in this next clip. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3119.6600000000003s)]
*  And these are people who are acting on behalf of foreign government telling me that I'm [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3125.8999999999996s)]
*  unpatriotic and I try not to get like crazy angry about it. But it's hard because you see these [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3131.5s)]
*  Ben Shapiro or these shills like come out and like attack you personally because- [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3139.3399999999997s)]
*  He was bashing you just this week. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3143.74s)]
*  But what's so infuriating is like I'm 56 in two weeks. So I've watched this. I was in Iraq. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3147.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm not an expert on anything and I would never claim expertise or try not to claim expertise I [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3153.74s)]
*  don't have. But just I have a good memory and I was there for a lot of this stuff. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3157.5s)]
*  And I have unresolved rage for the reasons I just explained. No one's apologized, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3161.8999999999996s)]
*  no one's repented, no one's changed. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3166.14s)]
*  He's right about that. The neocons have never apologized for dragging the United States into [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3169.1s)]
*  a preemptive war with Iraq, which was absolutely disastrous. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3174.3799999999997s)]
*  Right. Nobody in Washington apologizes for anything, right? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3177.66s)]
*  Right, that's true. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3181.02s)]
*  So Kamala Harris, instead of asking for an apology from Dick Cheney, gave him a bear hug [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3181.58s)]
*  and then sunk her own campaign. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3185.9s)]
*  Yep. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3187.98s)]
*  It's just a bunch of morons in Washington who just, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3188.2999999999997s)]
*  so they're so hooked on donor money, right? They're like, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3191.02s)]
*  I don't know, the donors tell me to bear hug Dick Cheney. He's sitting at a 9% approval rating. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3194.62s)]
*  But okay, sure, I'll do anything a donor tells me. It's like Ron Burgundy, but except with donors, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3199.34s)]
*  right? I'll do anything a donor puts in the prompter. So okay, so that's the Democrats. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3205.18s)]
*  Trump then comes in, does worse. He's like, yeah, we'll go and deal with the unexploded [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3209.5s)]
*  bombs in Gaza so that the more precious Israeli lives will be saved and Americans will get blown [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3215.98s)]
*  up by those bombs instead. Wow, you really sound like you're America first. So I mean, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3222.38s)]
*  it's so over the top that, I think the bench of the world don't understand your old tricks [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3228.94s)]
*  are not going to work anymore, right? Cats out of the bag. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3237.34s)]
*  So before they had a totally contained with mainstream media, right? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3241.58s)]
*  Mainstream media was like you step one inch out of line. You say anything against Israel, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3245.9s)]
*  canceled, canceled, and then you'll be canceled for the rest of your life, right? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3251.58s)]
*  Now guys, mainstream media, sorry, hashtag suck it. You're not in charge anymore, okay? So now you [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3257.6600000000003s)]
*  can't contain us. You can't contain us on the left. You can't contain them on the right. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3263.42s)]
*  Now go cry about it. No, Israel, beloved Israel. No, go ahead, Danabash, go ahead. Go ahead. I don't [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3267.34s)]
*  care. No one cares about you anymore. We now know what the hell's going on. Some country took $300 [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3273.98s)]
*  billion and it wasn't us, it was them, right? And so, and right now Israel's starving the children [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3279.7400000000002s)]
*  of Gaza. It hasn't let in food for two months, those monsters, okay? It's not all the Israeli [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3285.1s)]
*  people, it's the current government of Israel. So now, when you look at this fight between Ben [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3291.1s)]
*  Shapiro and Tucker Carlson, first of all, the fact that there is a fight is awesome. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3297.58s)]
*  It is awesome, absolutely. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3300.86s)]
*  Right? And I will say to my beloved friends on the left that said that there would be no breaks. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3301.58s)]
*  How could, so if you, we must hate Ben Shapiro, obviously. We must hate Tucker Carlson, obviously. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3308.22s)]
*  What happens when they disagree? Does not compute, does not compute, hate both of them, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3313.8199999999997s)]
*  cannot know what they agree on. Okay, all right, well, do you have a side? Do you have an ideology? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3320.38s)]
*  Do you have any ideas of your own other than must hate all right wingers and oppose them 100%? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3326.62s)]
*  Okay, on this issue, I am on Tucker Carlson's side and not on Ben Shapiro's side. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3331.7400000000002s)]
*  Because I have a mind and I use it. It's for independent judgment, okay? On other issues, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3337.1800000000003s)]
*  I disagree with both of them. Okay, so now let's go to the daily wire drama. So first of all, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3343.5s)]
*  Ben Shapiro is picking all the wrong fights. Okay? You're gonna mess around with Tucker Carlson [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3348.7s)]
*  on the right wing. I've had it, hoss. Good luck. Let's see how it turns out. Okay, number two. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3354.46s)]
*  Now that you're having financial troubles, did I say that out loud? All of a sudden, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3362.3799999999997s)]
*  it's not just Candace Owens anymore. Now, your boy, Matt Walsh, your big star, right? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3367.5s)]
*  Now he's popping off. And he's popping off in a way that's waving a flag. You think we're not [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3373.66s)]
*  gonna notice that? You think Matt Walsh doesn't know that we're not gonna notice that? Okay, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3379.82s)]
*  that's him firing a shot across the bow. I mean, because that's not just, hey, maybe we should [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3385.9s)]
*  stop giving them money. That's maybe if we keep giving them money, they shouldn't exist. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3391.2599999999998s)]
*  That is a, that's not a shot across the bow. That hit the bow. That hit the bow. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3397.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's a very provocative statement. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3401.66s)]
*  It's a very provocative, by the way, I don't agree with that. I think Israel has every right [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3403.5s)]
*  to exist, okay? Just don't think they have a right to our money, and they don't have a right to [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3406.94s)]
*  slaughter innocent Palestinians, right? So now, Matt Walsh and Tucker are now more anti-Israel [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3410.54s)]
*  than the left, and that is fascinating, okay? And again, anti-Israel and pro-Israel is not the right [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3420.8599999999997s)]
*  way of looking at it. We're just not- [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3426.62s)]
*  Critical. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3428.94s)]
*  Yeah, critical of the current Israeli government, certainly, right? So, but there's something going [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3429.66s)]
*  on at the Daily Wire, because people know where their bread is buttered, and all of a sudden, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3434.94s)]
*  the bread appears to be unbuttered. So the natives are growing restless. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3439.18s)]
*  So that's what it looks like to me from the outside, but what would I know? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3444.46s)]
*  People like butter. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3447.9s)]
*  People like butter. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3448.62s)]
*  Yeah, especially on the right wing. They really love butter, okay. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3449.8199999999997s)]
*  Yep, all right, well, we're gonna take a break. We come back for the second hour of the show. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3454.06s)]
*  A pretty big update on a federal judge and his thoughts on the Trump administration using the [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3458.06s)]
*  Alien Enemies Act to deport people. This is a Trump-appointed judge who [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3466.22s)]
*  appears to disagree with Trump. So that and more coming up, don't miss it. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyDHA7SkiXQ&t=3471.8999999999996s)]
