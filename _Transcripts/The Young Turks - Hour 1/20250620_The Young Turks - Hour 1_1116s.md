"A hospital in the Israeli town of Beersheba has been hit as Iran fired a barrage of missiles at the country, with the conflict between the two nations continuing into a seventh day.
Iran said it had targeted a military site close to the Soroka hospital, not the facility itself. Israel said 271 people were injured in strikes reported across the country."

# Israel Hospital Strike Exposes MASSIVE Hypocrisy
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k)
*  The moment an Iranian missile slammed into Soroka Hospital in Beersheba this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=0.0s)]
*  Inside panic and chaos as doctors and patients fled to the bomb shelters. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=11.28s)]
*  This is the largest medical facility in the south. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=19.04s)]
*  The emergency room was operational at the time of the attack, but there were only minor [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=22.38s)]
*  injuries. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=27.96s)]
*  Israel is now promising revenge after the Iranian missile that you saw talked about [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=29.6s)]
*  in that video. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=33.28s)]
*  Did in fact hit one of the country's largest hospitals as they acknowledged, thankfully [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=34.28s)]
*  and perhaps miraculously considering how damaging the attack looked in that case. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  There were no fatalities as a result of it, although there were some injuries. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  In the larger conflict though, there has been a number of deaths. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=47.72s)]
*  Human rights groups estimate that 639 Iranians and 24 Israelis have been killed since Israel [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  launched this war just about a week ago. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  And in the context of this particular hospital, one might wonder why is that being targeted [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=61.64s)]
*  by Iran? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=65.44s)]
*  Well, they say or at least the official Iranian news agency says that Iran was targeting the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=66.44s)]
*  headquarters of the IDF's elite technological unit and an intelligence camp about a mile [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=70.6s)]
*  from the hospital, which Israel says is BS. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=76.28s)]
*  They use a different term, that's basically what they mean. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=79.84s)]
*  And I mean, it was a mile away, which means that either it's BS or their aim is not particularly [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=81.92s)]
*  good in any event. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=87.48s)]
*  Israel is promising to punish not only Iran, but perhaps directly the leader for this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=89.64s)]
*  The Minister of Defense for Israel accused Iran of war crimes of the most serious kind [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=96.08s)]
*  and said that the Ayatollah individually should be held accountable for his crimes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Saying the Prime Minister and I instructed the IDF to increase the intensity of the attacks [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=106.64s)]
*  against strategic targets in Iran and against government targets in Tehran in order to remove [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=111.04s)]
*  the threats against the state of Israel and undermine the regime of the Ayatollahs. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=116.48s)]
*  So just bear in mind that while the narrative, the log line of the war is that it's supposed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=121.2s)]
*  to stop the nuclear program of Iran from the very beginning and now they're just stating [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=126.6s)]
*  it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=131.72s)]
*  It's attempting to undermine the regime and to murder the members of their government [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=132.72s)]
*  to be very clear. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=136.36s)]
*  Now, they are saying that attacking a hospital is a crime, is a war crime, which I agree [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=137.48s)]
*  on. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=142.8s)]
*  In this particular case, Benjamin Netanyahu appears to agree, take a look. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=143.8s)]
*  I think it says everything about Israel and about Iran. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=146.84s)]
*  Israel is fighting to remove the nuclear missile threat aimed at our annihilation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=152.4s)]
*  We're targeting military sites, we're targeting nuclear sites, we're targeting missile sites. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=158.0s)]
*  They're targeting a hospital. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=164.24s)]
*  In this hospital, there are patients who are immobile, they can't even move. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=166.24s)]
*  Right next to it is a children's ward, a baby's ward, infants, they targeted. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=170.12s)]
*  I think striking a hospital is always wrong and we have perhaps, I guess, in comparison [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=175.44s)]
*  to some, the luxury here at the Young Turks to condemn it in all cases. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=180.36s)]
*  Unfortunately, the gentleman that you just saw in that video doesn't do that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=184.52s)]
*  He says it tells you everything you need to know that they targeted a hospital. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=188.16s)]
*  Well then I ask him, does it tell you everything we need to know about Israel, that you have [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=192.44s)]
*  targeted hospitals in Gaza constantly over the past two years? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=196.2s)]
*  In fact, according to the World Health Organization, there have been 697 attacks on healthcare [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=201.04s)]
*  services in Gaza since October 2023. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=207.12s)]
*  I think it's terrible that Iran hit this one hospital with this one missile and thank God [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=210.2s)]
*  nobody died. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=214.9s)]
*  I think it's 697 times worse that Israel has repeatedly done it over and over and over [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=216.04s)]
*  again. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=222.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, there were no miracles in those cases and many people died. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=223.72s)]
*  Many civilians died, many children, many infants died. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=229.32s)]
*  And I didn't see a video like that from Netanyahu after each of those attacks or ever, once, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=234.2s)]
*  ever about the fact that the hospitals and medical facilities had been targeted. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=241.24s)]
*  As of right now, only 19 of Gaza's 36 hospitals remain operational, including one hospital [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=247.02s)]
*  providing basic care for the remaining patients. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=253.22s)]
*  They're struggling under severe supply shortages, lack of health workers, many obviously have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=256.22s)]
*  been murdered, persistent insecurity and a surge of casualties, all while staff work [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  in impossible conditions, often without water, without electricity. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=265.14s)]
*  Of the 19 hospitals, 12 provide a variety of health services, while the rest are only [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=269.26s)]
*  able to provide basic emergency care. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=273.1s)]
*  94% of all hospitals in Gaza are damaged or destroyed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=276.26s)]
*  And this right here, if we bring up this graphic, this is a list of alleged IDF attacks on Gaza [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  hospitals. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=285.08s)]
*  That's from April to June of this year, many, many months into the conflict, still many, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=286.4s)]
*  many attacks on these hospitals. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  And to pull at your heartstrings, and I understand why it would as the father of a young child, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=296.11999999999995s)]
*  and Netanyahu in that video said that there's a ward for babies in that hospital. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=300.76s)]
*  And so you should be even angrier at Iran, which you should. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  But unfortunately, again, very routine during this conflict for Israel to attack Gaza maternity [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=309.04s)]
*  wards. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=314.32s)]
*  And as I said, I have a really young kid, so I mean, I kind of don't even want to read [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=315.32s)]
*  some of these graphics. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=322.72s)]
*  But in November of 2023, the IDF forced staff out of a pediatric intensive care unit at [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  the Al Nasser Children's Hospital to evacuate as they attacked northern Gaza. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=331.48s)]
*  People went in with cameras two weeks later after the hospital was evacuated and video [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=337.6s)]
*  appeared to show at least three of five dead infants with the bodies putrefying in close [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=341.36s)]
*  proximity to catheters and ventilators. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=347.0s)]
*  One baby is seen decomposing while lying alone, appearing to still be connected to an oximeter [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=350.16s)]
*  with a green oxygen tank nearby as insects appear to crawl on its chest. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=355.56s)]
*  Those particular babies were not killed by the bombardment, although many, many, many [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=361.24s)]
*  have been. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  They were totally voluntarily killed by the IDF soldiers forcing the doctors to leave [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=367.4s)]
*  them there. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  That was a totally optional thing that they chose to do. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  And no videos from Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=377.9s)]
*  No, this tells you everything you need to know about a government or its military. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  Man, I'm trying super hard not to hold it against Israeli civilians who at this late [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  juncture are 80% in favor of continuing to kill people in Gaza. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=393.0s)]
*  Okay, but I'm a much better person than they are. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=400.16s)]
*  So no, I will not ever hold it against civilians and I hate that Iran hit this hospital. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=404.24s)]
*  I think it's terrible and I don't want any hospitals hit. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=409.24s)]
*  I don't want any civilians killed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=412.56s)]
*  Now let's talk about the massive hypocrisy of not just Israel but the American media. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=414.6s)]
*  So I've heard in American media now dozens of times that 24 people have been killed in [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=420.42s)]
*  Israel, civilians. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=424.98s)]
*  Again, that's a tragedy and I don't say that glibly, it really is. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=425.98s)]
*  And by the way, that's why they should be furious at their government for starting this [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=430.06s)]
*  war and thinking, so what? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=433.72s)]
*  Probably a whole bunch of our citizens will die, but it helps Netanyahu's career, so we're [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=436.62s)]
*  gonna start this war. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=441.02000000000004s)]
*  Okay, how many times have you heard that 263 Iranian civilians have been killed? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=442.54s)]
*  But they're just Muslim lives. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=450.18s)]
*  My God, some kids were injured in this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=452.22s)]
*  Well, that's terrible. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=456.06s)]
*  I don't want any kids getting injured. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=457.42s)]
*  17,000 kids have been killed in Gaza, 17,000. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=459.7s)]
*  How often do you hear that on American news? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=466.54s)]
*  You can, when an Israeli is victimized, that is headline news, gigantic news. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=470.62s)]
*  Palestinian and Iranians killed, who cares? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=478.06s)]
*  They're just Muslim, right? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=480.42s)]
*  Do we really have to pretend to care? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=481.90000000000003s)]
*  No, apparently you don't. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=483.58000000000004s)]
*  You don't have to pretend to care at all. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=484.74s)]
*  And this is not like, well, I mean, Iran had it coming. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=486.74s)]
*  I know there's 263 of their civilians, men, women, and children were killed by Israel. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=488.94s)]
*  But hey, they had it coming because they started, no, right, Israel started the war. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=494.62s)]
*  But it doesn't matter. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=498.92s)]
*  No sympathy for Muslims ever, ever, ever. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=499.92s)]
*  I don't know if Jake Tapper one day is gonna write a book. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=503.02000000000004s)]
*  My God, we were all so incredibly bigoted against Muslims for [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=505.5s)]
*  our entire lives with every goddamn broadcast we ever did on cable news. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=509.90000000000003s)]
*  Is that book coming, Jake? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=515.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay, again, CBS News reports. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=516.86s)]
*  This was, Israel is saying this was an 800 pound bomb. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=519.34s)]
*  That's a giant bomb to drop in the middle of a city. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=522.74s)]
*  I condemn Iran for that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=524.66s)]
*  Israel's dropped countless 2,000 pound bombs. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=527.38s)]
*  One and a half times the size of the one that Iran dropped once and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=532.54s)]
*  they're like, this is an outrage. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=536.8199999999999s)]
*  But when you say that and you say it is not an outrage to drop endless [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=539.4599999999999s)]
*  2,000 pound bombs in the middle of Palestinian cities. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=544.9399999999999s)]
*  What you're saying is, I don't care about Muslim lives at all. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=550.06s)]
*  We're allowed to murder them as much as we like. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=554.2199999999999s)]
*  Okay, now you say, hey, Cenk, murder is a strong word. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=557.22s)]
*  You should reserve that only when Muslims do killings. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=561.98s)]
*  Then it's murder and slaughter and terrorist and savage and dirty, right? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=564.94s)]
*  When Israel does it, it's such an accident, was it? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=569.86s)]
*  Because you just heard the stats that John read to you. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=573.74s)]
*  17 hospitals completely leveled by, so did they miss over and over and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=576.34s)]
*  over and over because you can't just destroy a hospital with one bomb. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=581.82s)]
*  They had to level those hospitals. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=585.9s)]
*  They missed that many times. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=588.14s)]
*  Are they the most incompetent military in the history of the world? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=590.3000000000001s)]
*  They accidentally destroyed or damaged 94% of the hospitals in Gaza. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=593.1800000000001s)]
*  Has there ever been a military that deeply incompetent? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=600.0600000000001s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=605.62s)]
*  No, whenever they want to, they could pick off any Iranian scientist, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=606.94s)]
*  diplomat, politician, general. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=612.3399999999999s)]
*  They can kill all of Hezbollah at once. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=615.5799999999999s)]
*  They can kill them anywhere they like. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=618.0999999999999s)]
*  But did we accidentally bomb and destroy all of your hospitals? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=620.06s)]
*  But you should feel tremendous sympathy for me because one bomb got dropped [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=626.2199999999999s)]
*  at an Israeli hospital, and I do have sympathy for those people. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=632.66s)]
*  But then they demand that we have no sympathy for [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=636.5s)]
*  the tens of thousands that they murdered, obviously on purpose. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=640.78s)]
*  And now after being in the middle of this genocide, they start a war with Iran. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=648.1s)]
*  And then they say, but we've had some people injured, so [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=653.42s)]
*  we demand the world's tears because we are the victims. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=658.02s)]
*  Brothers and sisters, those civilians who got hit in the hospital are victims. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=662.3s)]
*  And your heart should break for them because they're normal, regular people. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=666.3s)]
*  They're not politicians, they're not the leaders of that country. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=669.74s)]
*  But when the Israeli government leaders tell me to have concerns for [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=672.7s)]
*  them, that's preposterous. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=678.26s)]
*  No, I have no sympathy for Netanyahu, Ben-Gavir, Smotrich, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=681.34s)]
*  who are genocidal maniacs. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=685.22s)]
*  It's like saying, some German civilians got killed. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=687.58s)]
*  You have to have sympathy for Goebbels and Hitler. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=690.34s)]
*  And no, I don't. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=692.54s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=693.54s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=694.26s)]
*  At all, zero, did I just compare them? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=695.02s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=697.34s)]
*  If you don't want to be compared to them, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=698.78s)]
*  maybe you shouldn't do a genocide. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=700.38s)]
*  Maybe you shouldn't start a war. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=702.14s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=703.78s)]
*  Israel, special rules. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=704.86s)]
*  They're allowed to murder, genocide, attack, and we all have to bow our heads. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=706.78s)]
*  No, I do not bow my head. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=711.5s)]
*  Israel is 100% wrong for starting this war. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=713.98s)]
*  100%, and every Israeli civilian that gets killed is 100% [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=717.14s)]
*  the fault of Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=721.62s)]
*  Wait, if you say, that's not fair. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=724.3s)]
*  You're blaming the victim. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=727.2199999999999s)]
*  Every time somebody said, hey, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=729.02s)]
*  Israel's killing tens of thousands of kids here, and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=730.6999999999999s)]
*  then some civilians, they said, Hamas started it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=733.8199999999999s)]
*  It's all Hamas's fault. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=736.2199999999999s)]
*  Okay, Israel started it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=737.8599999999999s)]
*  So that means it is definitely Netanyahu's fault for [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=739.2199999999999s)]
*  every Israeli civilian killed. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=742.5799999999999s)]
*  It was a terrorist Netanyahu that is the root cause of those deaths. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=744.18s)]
*  That's Israeli logic. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=748.8199999999999s)]
*  That is Netanyahu logic. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=750.62s)]
*  And I know a lot of people will say yes, Cenk, but [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=752.62s)]
*  you're missing the central point. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=755.38s)]
*  Israeli lives are super precious and valuable, as all human lives should be. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=758.22s)]
*  But Muslim lives are useless and are expendable. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=763.4200000000001s)]
*  And you could just murder their children and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=768.1s)]
*  the American press will pretend you're the victim. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=769.94s)]
*  Go ahead, Trey. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=772.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know how much I can even add to it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=772.86s)]
*  I agree with you guys about taking the apparently, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=776.0200000000001s)]
*  sadly controversial to some American stance that bombing hospitals is always [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=780.5799999999999s)]
*  bad and should not happen. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=785.3s)]
*  That's also how I feel about it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=786.6999999999999s)]
*  But yes, the main thing I saw when I saw the response, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=788.5s)]
*  the main thing I thought when I saw the response to it from Israel and [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=791.78s)]
*  what Netanyahu said was just like, I mean, my God, the audacity. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=794.02s)]
*  I can't imagine the shameless audacity of that. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=798.42s)]
*  It's like they say, Iran, they've crossed the line here. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=800.8199999999999s)]
*  This is a war crime. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=804.54s)]
*  It's like, y'all are the most habitually line crossing people in [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=805.6999999999999s)]
*  the war crime game and everybody knows it. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=811.02s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=814.98s)]
*  It reminds me of like, and obviously this is on a much, much lower scale, but [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=816.06s)]
*  it's the type of thing like when over here when like how a lot of conservatives [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=819.86s)]
*  would just when they talk about the left, they're just gleefully bandy about [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=823.86s)]
*  homophobic slurs, even racial slurs, it calls like cucks and libtards and all that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=827.62s)]
*  And then in response, you're like, screw you fascist. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=832.26s)]
*  And they're like, wow, name calling, really? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=834.82s)]
*  Okay, if you want to take it there, it's like that type of this makes you pull [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=837.5s)]
*  your hair out the hypocrisy of it all. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=842.5s)]
*  But I mean, Jack, I mean, you're right about everything you said about [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=844.9000000000001s)]
*  the assessment of it. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=849.62s)]
*  It's like to some people and they wouldn't say it this exact way, maybe, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=850.94s)]
*  although some of them might, but it's like internally they're like, yeah, well, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=855.4200000000001s)]
*  but see, but this is worse because these are like, see, these are good people. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=858.86s)]
*  They're on the side of the West. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=864.46s)]
*  This is Israel. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=867.1s)]
*  These are good people. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=867.74s)]
*  They're being killed. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=868.62s)]
*  And then when they do it, those people are, well, you know what I mean? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=869.38s)]
*  They're just not as, and it's like, yes, they're poor, they're brown, they're [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=874.4200000000001s)]
*  Muslim, all that stuff that people just don't care about as much. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=878.62s)]
*  But and it's a shame, but I just don't know how Israel feels like they have a leg [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=883.98s)]
*  to stand on in this situation because the other thing, as you pointed out, also you [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=887.7s)]
*  started it like it wouldn't even have happened if you hadn't made the initial [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=892.82s)]
*  attack in the first place, which by the way, on that note, when that happened, I [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=898.82s)]
*  was like, my God, do y'all not have enough on your plate already? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=901.74s)]
*  Like, I feel like you're not getting enough, you know, your murder itched, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=904.82s)]
*  scratched enough or something. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=909.4200000000001s)]
*  Cause like, I thought you guys were pretty busy now. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=911.2600000000001s)]
*  You're starting some stuff over here with these, but you know, you do that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=913.7s)]
*  They respond and then you cry about it. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=916.6600000000001s)]
*  I just, I don't have a lot of sympathy for them. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=918.94s)]
*  I also have sympathy for the civilians, like you guys said, but Israel, the entity [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=921.7s)]
*  and its leadership and all that, it's like, I'm just not trying to hear it really. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=927.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=930.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=931.34s)]
*  I can't help but add a couple of things. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=932.0200000000001s)]
*  First of all, Trey, greater Israel isn't going to build itself. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=933.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=936.62s)]
*  They got to get medicine, right? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=936.94s)]
*  And so those maps are in their cabinet room. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=938.38s)]
*  I mean, they're not hiding the fact that these are aggressive imperial wars [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=942.38s)]
*  meant to seize Arab land. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=946.82s)]
*  And if they have to kill a bunch of Arabs and Persians to do it, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=948.54s)]
*  well, greater Israel's got to get built. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=951.94s)]
*  I mean, that is such an important, important policy for America. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=953.98s)]
*  Wait, what does America have to do with it? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=959.7s)]
*  But no, we have to fund all of it. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=961.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=962.74s)]
*  Iran says the Israeli intelligence building was behind the hospital. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=965.34s)]
*  John pointed out, it might've been like a mile behind the hospital. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=970.3s)]
*  So on the other hand, Israel said, oh, we had to get hit the first hospital they [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=972.98s)]
*  hit. They were like, we had to. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=978.3s)]
*  They got tunnels underneath. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=980.3s)]
*  So they brought in Trey Yanks from Fox News. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=981.42s)]
*  And he looked and he's like, it's not underneath the hospital at all. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  It's all the way over there. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=986.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=987.42s)]
*  They said, no, no, it counts. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=988.4599999999999s)]
*  It counts. Good enough. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=989.6999999999999s)]
*  Human shields. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=991.06s)]
*  So it was okay that we murdered them. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  It's Hamas's fault. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=993.54s)]
*  Is Israel using human shields? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=996.26s)]
*  I mean, that's not my logic. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=998.9s)]
*  That's Israeli logic. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1000.0999999999999s)]
*  They say if a military facility is anywhere near a hospital, you're allowed to murder [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1002.06s)]
*  everyone in the hospital. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1008.02s)]
*  That's not my logic. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1010.3s)]
*  I hate that logic. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1011.14s)]
*  But they say I could destroy the whole hospital. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1012.42s)]
*  I could kill everyone in it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1014.62s)]
*  I could leave babies to die in that hospital because, hey, there was a tunnel, a whole, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1016.22s)]
*  you know, couple of blocks away from the hospital. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1023.38s)]
*  It seems like the Iranian and Israeli logic match pretty well. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1026.26s)]
*  Last piece of Israeli logic. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1029.34s)]
*  They say, no, we didn't kill any of the 56,000 people in Gaza. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1031.3s)]
*  Hamas did. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1037.1799999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1038.22s)]
*  Because they started the war. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1039.06s)]
*  And if you start the war, then you're responsible for every single death, including on your [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1041.1799999999998s)]
*  side. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1045.06s)]
*  Not my logic. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1046.78s)]
*  That's Israel's logic. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1047.9399999999998s)]
*  So since they 100% started this war, every death in Israel is on Netanyahu's head. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1049.3s)]
*  And there's no question about that. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1055.82s)]
*  They can't say, well, well, they can't say that. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1057.58s)]
*  And they probably will say, well, yes, but you're right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1059.62s)]
*  But I get it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1062.46s)]
*  But on the other hand, these are Israeli lives. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1063.06s)]
*  So they're super important. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1065.86s)]
*  And those are Muslim lives. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1068.02s)]
*  And we get to murder Muslims all we want. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1070.02s)]
*  Anti-Semite. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1072.1s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1073.34s)]
*  You say you get to murder any Muslims you like. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1074.5s)]
*  And then when we point out that fact, then you say, oh, it's anti-Semitic to point out [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1077.1799999999998s)]
*  that a government's leader has ordered the murder of over 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1082.9799999999998s)]
*  and has destroyed all of their hospitals, has started a war and created a genocide. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1089.9799999999998s)]
*  No, no. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1095.3000000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu and everyone who supports him is deeply hateful, racist, bigots. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1096.8600000000001s)]
*  Okay, two can play at that game. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1103.66s)]
*  And we're actually accurate as opposed to the Israeli supporters. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apexlWn0a0k&t=1105.38s)]
