# Trump Backs Down On Tariffs & Interest Rates - The Young Turks April 23, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg)
*  Welcome to TYT, I'm your host, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=30.0s)]
*  Anna Kasparian, and we have a roller [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=32.76s)]
*  coaster of a show ahead for you [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=36.1s)]
*  today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=38.74s)]
*  First off, let me begin by saying [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=40.66s)]
*  that in the second hour, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=42.18s)]
*  Cenk Uygur will be joining us to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=43.28s)]
*  make a massive announcement, so [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=44.72s)]
*  stick around for that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=46.22s)]
*  But before we even get to that, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  we have a lot of news to update [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  you on, including where Trump [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=51.06s)]
*  currently stands on his tariffs [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=52.900000000000006s)]
*  policy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=54.82s)]
*  It appears that he's backed off a [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=55.42s)]
*  little bit, except Caroline Leib [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=57.42s)]
*  it, White House press secretary is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=59.4s)]
*  kind of contradicting what he's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=61.32s)]
*  saying, so we'll get into [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=63.12s)]
*  the details on that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=64.56s)]
*  We'll also talk about this schism [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=65.8s)]
*  within the Trump administration in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=68.32s)]
*  regard to tax policy. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=70.9s)]
*  It appears, and there are names [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=72.8s)]
*  named here, that some of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=74.76s)]
*  individuals in Trump's orbit [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=76.44s)]
*  absolutely want to raise taxes on [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=78.32s)]
*  the rich in order to balance [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=80.66s)]
*  the budget. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=82.32s)]
*  So we'll tell you who those [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=83.26s)]
*  individuals are and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  what the likelihood is that this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=86.42s)]
*  tax bill, a GOP tax bill, would [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=88.52s)]
*  actually include a provision [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=90.5s)]
*  increasing taxes on the wealthiest [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=92.46s)]
*  among us. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=94.84s)]
*  We'll also talk about what [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=95.44s)]
*  the Supreme Court is likely going [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=97.16s)]
*  to decide when it comes to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=99.34s)]
*  LGBT school curriculum. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=100.9s)]
*  This has to do with elementary [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=103.9s)]
*  schools in Montgomery County, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=105.3s)]
*  Maryland, but obviously, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  depending on how they rule, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=108.02s)]
*  it's going to have a huge impact [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=109.28s)]
*  on public education all [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=110.62s)]
*  across the country. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  So we're going to get to all of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=112.7s)]
*  that, we're going to have a lot of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=114.22s)]
*  fun on the show today. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=115.7s)]
*  Without further ado, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=116.82s)]
*  let's begin with this first story. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=117.88s)]
*  The SMP has dropped the most under [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=120.64s)]
*  Trump for any president at this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=122.72s)]
*  point in their presidency since [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=124.8s)]
*  the SMP 500 was in fact created [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=126.84s)]
*  back in 1957. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=128.96s)]
*  And indeed, it is not anywhere [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=130.04s)]
*  close, folks, it's not anywhere [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=132.08s)]
*  close, under Trump, it's dropped, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=134.16s)]
*  get this, 14%. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=136.5s)]
*  If Donald Trump believes that he [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=137.68s)]
*  can somehow escape blame, if there [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=139.38s)]
*  is in fact a recession, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=141.26s)]
*  I'm here for a reality check. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=142.54s)]
*  He will simply put, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=144.18s)]
*  not be able to do so. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=145.28s)]
*  Blame Trump if there's a recession [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  in the next 12 months, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  look at this, a lot or quite a bit, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=149.28s)]
*  that's the majority winner right [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=150.9s)]
*  there at 52%. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=152.52s)]
*  Those are some pretty bleak numbers [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=153.12s)]
*  for President Donald Trump who has [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=155.58s)]
*  lost quite a bit of favorability in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=157.86s)]
*  regard to his economic policies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=160.18s)]
*  Obviously, it has a lot to do with [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=163.12s)]
*  his tariffs policies. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=164.84s)]
*  It has to do with the fact that he [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  keeps threatening to fire Jerome [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Powell, the head of the Federal [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=169.16000000000003s)]
*  Reserve. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  But those numbers that Harry Enton [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=170.96s)]
*  just shared with us could be the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=172.8s)]
*  reason why Trump appears to be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=174.46s)]
*  softening his message a little bit [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=176.02s)]
*  at least when it comes to two of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=178.0s)]
*  his biggest crusades, higher [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=179.7s)]
*  tariffs of course, and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=181.5s)]
*  lower interest rates. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=182.86s)]
*  But Trump's press secretary, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=184.14s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, is contradicting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=185.9s)]
*  what he's saying. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=188.14s)]
*  So there's still a lot of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=189.22s)]
*  uncertainty in the market right [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=190.9s)]
*  now, and we're going to get to all [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=192.94s)]
*  of that in just a minute. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=194.98s)]
*  Before we get to Caroline Levitt, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=196.58s)]
*  let's start with the tariffs [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  policy and what Trump is saying now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=199.98s)]
*  So yesterday, Trump reportedly and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=202.3s)]
*  repeatedly stated that the sky [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  high 145% tariffs on China will not [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=207.0s)]
*  be permanent. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  In fact, let's watch him talk [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=212.52s)]
*  about that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=213.62s)]
*  145% is very high and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  it won't be that high, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=217.28s)]
*  not going to be that high. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=219.12s)]
*  It got up to there we were talking [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=221.96s)]
*  about fentanyl where various [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  elements built it up to 145. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=226.0s)]
*  No, it won't be anywhere near that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=228.4s)]
*  high. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=230.8s)]
*  What level do you think it will [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=231.34s)]
*  come down to? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=232.78s)]
*  It'll come down to 63 but [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=233.38s)]
*  it won't be a zero. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=235.04s)]
*  It used to be zero. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=236.54s)]
*  We were just destroyed China was [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  taking us for a ride and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=241.06s)]
*  just not going to have, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=242.82s)]
*  I think it's going to work out very [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  well, but no, it's at 145%. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  There will not be anywhere near [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=248.98s)]
*  that number. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=250.7s)]
*  So that is a softening of Trump's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=251.5s)]
*  tone for sure. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=253.94s)]
*  Now what's behind it? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=256.3s)]
*  Well, there could be a number of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=257.42s)]
*  different reasons, but it turns out [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=258.86s)]
*  that executives from Lowe's, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=260.52s)]
*  Home Depot, Walmart and Target hit [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=262.56s)]
*  the president up, showed up at [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=264.88s)]
*  the White House they met with him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=266.84s)]
*  And they started warning about some [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=269.36s)]
*  of the ramifications of these [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=271.36s)]
*  super high tariffs. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=273.0s)]
*  One of those ramifications could be [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=274.6s)]
*  empty store shelves. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=277.24s)]
*  And honestly, that messaging toward [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=279.36s)]
*  Donald Trump, I can see how [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=281.56s)]
*  effective it could be because of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=283.12s)]
*  what it evokes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=284.96s)]
*  It evokes the supply chain [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=286.6s)]
*  disruptions that led to empty [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=288.04s)]
*  shelves during COVID. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  I think COVID was the main reason [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=291.12s)]
*  why Trump lost his reelection bid [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=295.12s)]
*  So it appears that that had some [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=296.56s)]
*  influence over him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=298.28s)]
*  But if you look at the different [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=299.84s)]
*  numbers that his administration is [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  now considering in regard to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=303.84s)]
*  tariffs against China or [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=305.42s)]
*  products imported to the United [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=306.96s)]
*  States from China, it doesn't really [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  seem like they're going to be soft [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=311.12s)]
*  on China. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm going to keep it real with you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  So let's get into those details [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=314.88s)]
*  right now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=316.28s)]
*  So this morning, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=317.48s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal reported [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=318.62s)]
*  more details on what the Trump [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=320.58s)]
*  administration has in mind when it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=322.34s)]
*  comes to China tariffs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=324.34s)]
*  One senior White House official [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  said the China tariffs were likely [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=327.58s)]
*  to come down to between roughly 50% [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=329.79999999999995s)]
*  and 65%. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=332.18s)]
*  I mean, whether it's 145% or 60%, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=332.97999999999996s)]
*  does it really matter? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=335.46s)]
*  I mean, is that really going to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=337.14s)]
*  make much of a difference? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=338.9s)]
*  It's not, okay? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=340.58s)]
*  With tariffs that high, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  we're not going to import or [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=342.9s)]
*  businesses are not going to want to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=344.29999999999995s)]
*  want to import tariffs. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  Businesses are not going to want to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=347.4s)]
*  import products from China into [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=348.84s)]
*  the United States. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=350.28s)]
*  But nonetheless, I personally think [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=351.36s)]
*  it's effectively the same thing or [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=353.32s)]
*  it's going to have the same outcome. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=355.04s)]
*  So the administration is also [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=357.0s)]
*  considering a tiered approach [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=359.24s)]
*  similar to the one proposed by [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=361.42s)]
*  the House Committee on China late [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=363.6s)]
*  last year. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  That includes a 35% levy for items. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=367.56s)]
*  The United States deems not a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  threat to national security and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=372.92s)]
*  at least 100% for items deemed as [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=375.82s)]
*  strategic to America's interests. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=378.38s)]
*  So look, I think that doing [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=382.26s)]
*  targeted tariffs could make [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=383.66s)]
*  a lot of sense. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=385.1s)]
*  I've said this repeatedly, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=386.18s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=387.52s)]
*  Donald Trump's tariffs against [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=388.5s)]
*  China in his first term were [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=390.46s)]
*  targeted. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=392.14s)]
*  And in fact, they worked out so [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=393.38s)]
*  well that the Biden administration [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=395.14s)]
*  kept them in place and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=397.14s)]
*  expanded on them further. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=398.38s)]
*  But Biden didn't expand on them in [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=399.94s)]
*  a ridiculous way. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=401.86s)]
*  He did it carefully, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=403.54s)]
*  thoughtfully, strategically in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=404.52s)]
*  a way that suits America's [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=406.24s)]
*  interests. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=407.74s)]
*  And that's why I wouldn't have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=408.56s)]
*  a problem with Trump doing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=410.04s)]
*  something similar, targeted tariffs. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=411.28s)]
*  In this case, he just kind of bit [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=413.8s)]
*  off more than he could chew. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=415.36s)]
*  He assumed he could bully all these [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=417.0s)]
*  different countries into giving him [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=418.88s)]
*  exactly what he wants. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=420.84s)]
*  And in the case of Xi Jinping, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=422.08s)]
*  the President of China, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=423.76s)]
*  he's actually calling Trump's [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=425.16s)]
*  bluff and Trump's starting to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=426.84s)]
*  panic a little bit about that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=428.48s)]
*  As you can see from how these [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=430.36s)]
*  negotiations are going. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=431.92s)]
*  In fact, experts are arguing that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=433.62s)]
*  those 50% tariffs that the Trump [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=435.46000000000004s)]
*  administration is considering [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=437.18s)]
*  against Chinese imports would [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=438.82000000000005s)]
*  basically still shut down almost [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=440.38s)]
*  all trade between the United States [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=442.18s)]
*  and China. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=443.98s)]
*  So we'll see what he ends up [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=444.54s)]
*  deciding in the end. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=446.22s)]
*  But China clearly believes that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=448.26000000000005s)]
*  they are the ones with [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=450.06s)]
*  the upper hand here. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=451.26000000000005s)]
*  I don't know if that's necessarily [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=452.62s)]
*  true. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=454.18s)]
*  We have 330 million Americans here. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=454.68s)]
*  That's a lot of consumers that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  China wants to, of course, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=458.34000000000003s)]
*  profit from, make money from. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=460.3s)]
*  But in China's policymaking circles, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=463.0s)]
*  Trump's comments on Tuesday of this [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  week were viewed as a sign of him [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=467.84s)]
*  folding people who consult with [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=469.84s)]
*  Chinese officials said. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=472.14s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=474.88s)]
*  Trump has been hoping that he'd get [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=475.38s)]
*  a call from President Xi. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  That hasn't happened. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=478.96s)]
*  In addition to that, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  the administration has been pushing [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  for China's foreign minister to hit [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=482.85999999999996s)]
*  up Marco Rubio and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=484.55999999999995s)]
*  have a chat with him. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=485.4s)]
*  So far, that hasn't happened either. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=487.0s)]
*  But while Trump softened his tone [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=489.08s)]
*  on China, his press secretary, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, kind of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=492.02s)]
*  contradicted his messaging. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=493.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=494.94s)]
*  Is it fair to say, Caroline, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=496.74s)]
*  that the President's stance on [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=498.7s)]
*  tariffs with China is softening? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=500.58s)]
*  I don't think that's fair to say. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=503.98s)]
*  In fact, I spoke to the President [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=505.7s)]
*  about it this morning. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=507.0s)]
*  He is not going to give up on [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=507.94s)]
*  ensuring that there are fair trade [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=509.32s)]
*  practices around the world. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=511.1s)]
*  He is not giving up on the fact [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=512.74s)]
*  that China has been ripping off [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=514.38s)]
*  the United States of America for [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=515.98s)]
*  far too long. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=517.58s)]
*  Let me be clear, there will be no [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=518.42s)]
*  unilateral reduction in tariffs [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=520.18s)]
*  against China. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  The President has made it clear, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=523.0s)]
*  China needs to make a deal with [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=524.36s)]
*  the United States of America. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=525.56s)]
*  And we are optimistic that will [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=527.3199999999999s)]
*  happen. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=529.0s)]
*  And when that continues, it'll be [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=529.6s)]
*  up to the President what the tariff [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=531.72s)]
*  rate on China will be. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=533.76s)]
*  But we certainly need to see [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=535.0s)]
*  a reduction in tariffs and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=536.6s)]
*  non-monetary tariff barriers from [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=538.12s)]
*  China as well. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay, but I think it's pretty clear [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  that China isn't willing to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=545.52s)]
*  negotiate here, right? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=547.16s)]
*  Based on what Trump has kind of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=548.92s)]
*  opened with, President Xi has not [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=550.98s)]
*  budged at all. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=553.5400000000001s)]
*  So this idea that the percentage [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=555.5400000000001s)]
*  that Trump wants to tack on for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=558.1s)]
*  Chinese tariffs isn't going to come [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=560.3000000000001s)]
*  down until China engages in [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=562.88s)]
*  a negotiation, again, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=564.86s)]
*  is kind of counter to what Trump [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=566.6s)]
*  was saying earlier. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=568.62s)]
*  This just leads to more [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=570.3000000000001s)]
*  uncertainty in the markets. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=571.3000000000001s)]
*  Again, I want to reiterate, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=572.5s)]
*  I wouldn't have a problem with [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=573.86s)]
*  tariffs if they're targeted, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=575.22s)]
*  strategic, and actually did serve [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=576.62s)]
*  the best interests of [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=578.26s)]
*  the American people. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=579.22s)]
*  Even if there's a little bit of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=580.28s)]
*  short-term pain on some items, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=582.36s)]
*  if it suits our national security [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=584.4399999999999s)]
*  or what have you, especially as it [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=586.6s)]
*  pertains to things like [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=588.84s)]
*  pharmaceutical drugs, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=590.2s)]
*  I would be open to that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=591.68s)]
*  But that's not what we have here. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=592.96s)]
*  We have this weird blanket policy. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=594.16s)]
*  I get that you want to start [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=597.36s)]
*  a negotiation off with the highest [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=598.56s)]
*  possible number, and then you just [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=600.08s)]
*  kind of go back and forth until you [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=601.68s)]
*  come up with a number that makes [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=603.16s)]
*  sense for both parties. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=604.48s)]
*  But again, President Xi just will [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=605.72s)]
*  not budge on this so far. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=607.48s)]
*  So when it comes to China, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=608.86s)]
*  the future still appears to be [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=610.74s)]
*  incredibly uncertain when it comes [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  to our trade relationship. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=614.98s)]
*  So that's what we know for now, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=617.38s)]
*  when it comes to Trump's tariffs [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=619.1800000000001s)]
*  policy. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=621.02s)]
*  But let's move over to the notion [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=621.7s)]
*  of firing Jerome Powell, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=623.7s)]
*  the head of the Federal Reserve, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=625.1800000000001s)]
*  because of the fact that he's [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=626.98s)]
*  unwilling to do Trump's bidding and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=628.52s)]
*  lower interest rates prematurely. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=630.4200000000001s)]
*  So President Donald Trump is now [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=632.34s)]
*  backing off of his threats toward [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=634.5s)]
*  Jerome Powell. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=636.74s)]
*  He had said earlier that he wants [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=638.12s)]
*  to fire him, and now he's like, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=640.0s)]
*  what, who, me? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=642.06s)]
*  Me? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=643.16s)]
*  You think I want to fire Jerome [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=643.66s)]
*  Powell? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=646.36s)]
*  Okay, so let's back up. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=647.0799999999999s)]
*  This is what I love, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=649.72s)]
*  he said something one day. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=650.72s)]
*  Next day, he says something [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=652.92s)]
*  entirely different and tries to [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=654.24s)]
*  make you out to be the crazy one. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=655.8399999999999s)]
*  So basically, this kind of started [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=657.6s)]
*  last week when Trump wrote, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  Powell's termination cannot come [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  fast enough. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=664.56s)]
*  Now again, Trump wants the Federal [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=666.58s)]
*  Reserve to lower interest rates. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=668.52s)]
*  Jerome Powell is holding off on [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=670.8199999999999s)]
*  that partly because of the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=672.66s)]
*  uncertainty that comes along with [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=674.14s)]
*  Trump's tariffs policy. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=675.98s)]
*  But also because of the fact that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=677.98s)]
*  inflation has been far more sticky [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=680.14s)]
*  than he expected. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=682.36s)]
*  Now the Federal Reserve has lowered [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=684.26s)]
*  interest rates a little bit and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=685.86s)]
*  they were planning to continue [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=687.22s)]
*  doing so for the rest of the year, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=688.58s)]
*  but they have kind of paused on [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=690.1s)]
*  that, and that's why Trump is so [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=691.5s)]
*  upset. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=693.06s)]
*  So he also said last week, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=694.02s)]
*  if I want Powell out, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=696.4799999999999s)]
*  he'll be out of there real fast, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=698.42s)]
*  believe me. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=701.3399999999999s)]
*  Willie, now look, it wasn't just [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=702.66s)]
*  Trump who was making statements [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=704.5799999999999s)]
*  like this. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=706.2199999999999s)]
*  Apparently, White House economic [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=706.7399999999999s)]
*  advisor Kevin Hassett said Friday [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=708.66s)]
*  that Trump and his aides were [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=710.4799999999999s)]
*  actively studying the possibility [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=711.9399999999999s)]
*  of firing Powell. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=713.9799999999999s)]
*  Now as we shared with you all [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=715.9s)]
*  earlier this week, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=717.3s)]
*  the President of the United States [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=718.26s)]
*  does not have the ability to oust [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=720.06s)]
*  the head of the Federal Reserve [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=721.6999999999999s)]
*  unilaterally without cause. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=723.28s)]
*  Powell would have to engage in [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=725.88s)]
*  malfeasance or some sort of bad [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=727.52s)]
*  behavior that would justify [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=729.36s)]
*  the President being able to fire [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=731.04s)]
*  him, to get rid of him. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=732.88s)]
*  But because of congressional [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=735.0s)]
*  legislation that passed earlier, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=736.52s)]
*  again, the President would be [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  unable to just fire Powell. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=739.98s)]
*  And Powell is unwilling to resign [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  despite the pressure he's been [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=743.08s)]
*  facing from Donald Trump and [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=744.6s)]
*  his administration. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=746.08s)]
*  So now all of a sudden, after the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=747.6s)]
*  stock market reacted poorly to [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=749.68s)]
*  Trump's attempts to oust Jerome [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=751.78s)]
*  Powell, Trump's now softening his [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=754.14s)]
*  message on Powell as well. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=756.74s)]
*  In fact, let's take a look at what [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=758.9s)]
*  he has to say. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=760.14s)]
*  You have no intention of firing [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=762.26s)]
*  Jerome Powell because here, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=763.74s)]
*  thanks to Ryan and Kevin Hassett, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=764.98s)]
*  a few days ago, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=766.5s)]
*  said that you and people in lives [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=767.18s)]
*  were studying this idea of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=768.58s)]
*  possibly being forced from the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=769.58s)]
*  head. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=770.86s)]
*  You don't have any plans on doing [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=771.38s)]
*  it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=772.78s)]
*  None whatsoever, never did. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=773.28s)]
*  The press runs away with things. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=777.06s)]
*  No, I have no intention of firing [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=778.66s)]
*  him. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=780.1s)]
*  I would like to see him be a little [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=780.76s)]
*  more active in terms of his idea to [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=783.28s)]
*  lower interest rates. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=785.84s)]
*  This is a perfect time to lower [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=787.68s)]
*  interest rates. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=789.48s)]
*  If he doesn't, is it the end? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=791.5600000000001s)]
*  No, it's not, but [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=793.12s)]
*  it would be good timing. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=794.16s)]
*  It could have taken place earlier, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=795.76s)]
*  but no, I have no intention to fire [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=798.32s)]
*  him. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=800.4s)]
*  You know, Jerome Powell would [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=802.68s)]
*  lower interest rates if Trump [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=804.32s)]
*  actually followed through with his [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=805.92s)]
*  campaign promise to lower inflation. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=807.92s)]
*  But as we know, tariffs lead to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=810.98s)]
*  inflationary pressure in the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=812.88s)]
*  economy, and that's part of the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=814.7s)]
*  reason why Jerome Powell is kind of [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=816.7s)]
*  pausing, backing off of the original [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=818.78s)]

*  He's kind of going forward with [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=903.8000000000001s)]
*  a policy that's kind of hard to [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=905.76s)]

*  these threats to fire Jerome [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=925.72s)]

*  And on top of that, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=939.88s)]
*  they're also saying, look, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=940.6800000000001s)]
*  if you get rid of Powell, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=941.9200000000001s)]

*  And so what's the point? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=949.44s)]
*  It's only going to harm the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  markets, the stock market [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=952.24s)]

*  Let's just back off this idea and [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=954.2s)]
*  see if we can maybe catch some flies [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=956.14s)]
*  with honey. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=958.02s)]
*  We'll see, we'll see what happens. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=959.14s)]

*  And what's also not really [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=966.54s)]
*  inspiring much confidence is [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=967.86s)]
*  the fact that different [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=969.38s)]

*  You'll hear Trump say one thing and [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=973.38s)]
*  then hours later, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=975.34s)]
*  his press secretary contradicts [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=976.42s)]
*  the very thing he said about his [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=978.34s)]
*  plans. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=979.98s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=980.82s)]
*  But right now, those low approval [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=981.78s)]

*  fraud, and abuse. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1104.02s)]
*  And they also need to find ways to [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1105.46s)]
*  raise revenue, which is why the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1106.82s)]
*  topic of raising taxes on the rich [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1108.18s)]
*  has come up now. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1109.74s)]
*  Now this news was confirmed by two [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1111.18s)]
*  administration officials who spoke [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1112.7s)]
*  to the Washington Post. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1114.18s)]
*  There were three other individuals [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1115.3s)]
*  who were briefed on the matter. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1116.86s)]
*  They confirmed the story to [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1118.38s)]
*  the Washington Post. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1119.66s)]
*  And according to Jeff Stein, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1120.6200000000001s)]
*  who reported the story for WAPO, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1122.26s)]
*  there are some surprising figures [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1124.48s)]
*  in the Trump administration who are [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1126.64s)]
*  totally on board for [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1128.96s)]
*  raising taxes for the rich. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1130.2800000000002s)]
*  Those individuals, by the way, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1132.3600000000001s)]
*  include Vice President JD Vance and [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1134.72s)]
*  someone I would never expect, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1137.4s)]
*  the budget director, Russell Vogt. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1139.5600000000002s)]
*  So they both expressed support to [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1142.76s)]
*  raise taxes on the rich. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1144.92s)]
*  Also in support is the guy that you [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1147.0400000000002s)]
*  heard from in the very beginning of [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1148.72s)]
*  this story, Steve Bannon. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1150.44s)]
*  He's been publicly urging Donald [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1152.4s)]
*  Trump to endorse the plan in order [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1154.04s)]
*  to defang the Democratic Party and [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1156.26s)]
*  their attacks on the GOP being [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1158.48s)]
*  the party of the rich. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1160.58s)]
*  Now look, make no mistake about it. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1162.02s)]
*  So far, the Republican Party [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1165.46s)]
*  continues to be the party of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1167.06s)]
*  the rich. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1168.6599999999999s)]
*  There's been a lot of rhetoric from [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1170.26s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign and [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1172.1399999999999s)]
*  now the Trump administration about [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1173.6599999999999s)]
*  how they're looking out for [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1175.54s)]
*  the middle class, the working class. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1176.86s)]
*  I haven't really seen much policy [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1178.46s)]
*  to bolster those claims. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1180.5s)]
*  If they do actually raise taxes on [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1182.64s)]
*  top earners in the country, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1184.8000000000002s)]
*  now we're having a conversation. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1186.5400000000002s)]
*  But is that likely to happen? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  Hold, you're about to hear from [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1192.2s)]
*  the opponents to this policy in [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1193.9s)]
*  just a minute. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1195.5600000000002s)]
*  But before you do, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1196.3600000000001s)]
*  here's what Steve Bannon said. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1197.18s)]
*  He says this, meaning raising taxes [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1199.2s)]
*  on the rich, guts the AOC Bernie [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1201.72s)]
*  oligarchy tour. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1204.1200000000001s)]
*  Politically, when it comes to hire [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1206.16s)]
*  taxes on the rich, it's game set [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1208.16s)]
*  match, it's a no brainer. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1210.16s)]
*  This would destroy the Democrats. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1211.86s)]
*  And look, I think he's right about [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1215.22s)]
*  that to be quite frank. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1217.3s)]
*  I think that Bannon, despite all of [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1219.1399999999999s)]
*  the issues I have with him, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1221.3s)]
*  is actually pretty smart. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1223.02s)]
*  He's savvy when it comes to [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1224.78s)]
*  political strategy. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1226.54s)]
*  And so he wants to destroy the one [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1228.4599999999998s)]
*  significant talking point the [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1230.5s)]
*  Democratic Party has had against [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1232.36s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1234.3s)]
*  And that's the fact that they've [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1235.54s)]
*  always looked out for corporate [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1236.8999999999999s)]
*  executives over the best interests [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1238.1799999999998s)]
*  of the American people. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1239.6999999999998s)]
*  Over the best interests of [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1240.8799999999999s)]
*  American workers. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1241.86s)]
*  Now Trump claims he wants to change [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1243.04s)]
*  that, but will he? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1245.12s)]
*  And again, we haven't really seen [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1246.76s)]
*  much evidence to bolster that [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1248.8799999999999s)]
*  claim yet. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1250.6599999999999s)]
*  Now Bannon also got into the nitty [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1252.04s)]
*  gritty of how the tax bill could [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1253.8799999999999s)]
*  work. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1255.6s)]
*  So one proposal would allow the top [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1256.12s)]
*  tax rate to revert to its level [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1258.6s)]
*  before the 2017 tax law. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1260.8799999999999s)]
*  My God, I mean, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1263.56s)]
*  could they even survive that? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1264.32s)]
*  So from 37% to 39.6%, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1266.12s)]
*  this would raise taxes for [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1268.78s)]
*  those with more than $626,350 in [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1271.14s)]
*  earnings. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1274.54s)]
*  People were paying that rate prior [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1275.46s)]
*  to the 2017 tax bill. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1278.66s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1280.74s)]
*  Income inequality in this country [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1281.94s)]
*  was still growing. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1284.06s)]
*  So they're going to be all right, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1285.3799999999999s)]
*  they're going to be okay if [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1287.62s)]
*  the tax rate increases. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1289.42s)]
*  That is the top tax rate. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1291.14s)]
*  So they're not going to pay 39.6% [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1292.78s)]
*  on the tax rate. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1295.22s)]
*  They're going to pay 39.6% on [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1296.44s)]
*  the entirety of their income. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1298.8400000000001s)]
*  But a certain amount of money they [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1301.04s)]
*  make above the $625,000 will be [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1304.3200000000002s)]
*  taxed at that 39.6% rate. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1307.5600000000002s)]
*  So that's one of the proposals. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1310.44s)]
*  What else is going on? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1315.4s)]
*  Well, there are other things that [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1316.48s)]
*  they're considering. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1318.3200000000002s)]
*  So Bannon and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1319.2s)]
*  some other Trump allies have also [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1319.96s)]
*  discussed a third idea to create [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1321.76s)]
*  an even higher top tax bracket. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1323.68s)]
*  For those earning more than $3 [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1325.66s)]
*  million or $5 million, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1328.0400000000002s)]
*  two of the people said. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1329.8200000000002s)]
*  One of the other ideas, by the way, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1331.7800000000002s)]
*  was to create a bracket that would [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1334.5800000000002s)]
*  charge higher taxes for individuals [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1337.0600000000002s)]
*  earning any amount of money above [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1339.7800000000002s)]
*  a million bucks a year, right? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1342.3000000000002s)]
*  So they're playing with these [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1344.8600000000001s)]
*  ideas. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1346.5s)]
*  In the end, it's unlikely to go [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1347.0600000000002s)]
*  anywhere, but I think that it's [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1348.74s)]
*  interesting to hear that there are [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1350.4s)]
*  people within Trump's orbit that [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1352.16s)]
*  are pushing for [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1353.74s)]
*  these types of policies. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1354.5400000000002s)]
*  So here's what's also super [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1355.56s)]
*  surprising, Treasury Secretary Scott [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1357.1599999999999s)]
*  Bessent is allegedly open to a range [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1359.6s)]
*  of ideas, including the possibility [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1361.96s)]
*  of raising taxes on Americans [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1364.32s)]
*  earning more than $5 million per [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1366.1599999999999s)]
*  year. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1368.52s)]
*  Now, let's talk about the anti-tax [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1370.1599999999999s)]
*  pro deregulation group, which [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1373.24s)]
*  honestly makes up the bulk of [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1375.76s)]
*  the Republican Party. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1377.92s)]
*  Obviously, those folks still exist [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1379.52s)]
*  within the Trump administration as [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1381.3999999999999s)]

*  He didn't win a second term, so [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1424.42s)]
*  that's what he's trying to warn [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1426.26s)]
*  Trump about. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1427.9s)]

*  bold promise during his 1988 [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1430.9s)]
*  address. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1433.06s)]
*  And if you weren't around back then [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1433.74s)]
*  or if you can't remember what he [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1435.74s)]
*  said, here's a little reminder. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1437.46s)]
*  And I'm the one who will not raise [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1439.24s)]
*  taxes. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1441.64s)]
*  My opponent now says he'll raise [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1442.24s)]

*  And I- [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1452.8s)]
*  My opponent won't rule out raising [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1453.32s)]

*  for the rest of my life. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1458.24s)]

*  going to raise taxes for the rest [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1466.48s)]
*  of my life, but I will and [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1468.74s)]
*  the Congress will push me to raise [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1470.14s)]
*  taxes and I'll say no. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1472.14s)]
*  And they'll push and I'll say no, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1473.6200000000001s)]
*  and they'll push again and [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1476.22s)]
*  I'll say to them, read my lips. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1478.3s)]
*  No new taxes. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1480.82s)]
*  Yeah, he then raised taxes and [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1481.8600000000001s)]
*  people were really upset about [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1484.22s)]
*  that, but he coupled those tax [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1486.5s)]
*  hikes with massive unpopular [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1488.8600000000001s)]
*  spending cuts. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1491.38s)]
*  And yeah, that did really [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1492.66s)]
*  change the way Trump's [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1494.46s)]
*  spending cuts. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1496.42s)]
*  And yeah, that did hurt him [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1497.8200000000002s)]
*  politically. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1499.1000000000001s)]
*  So the President accepted several [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1499.6200000000001s)]
*  tax increases, most notably an [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1502.18s)]
*  increase in the top personal tax [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1504.5s)]
*  rate to 31% from Reagan's 28%. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1506.9s)]
*  Democrats accepted spending cuts [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1509.42s)]
*  twice as large in dollar value. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1512.9s)]
*  When Americans are experiencing [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1517.3000000000002s)]
*  higher taxes, but [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1519.3000000000002s)]
*  they're getting less in return in [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1520.38s)]
*  terms of government programs, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1522.26s)]
*  yeah, they're going to be very [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1524.0600000000002s)]
*  upset. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1525.6s)]
*  But Trump's a little different. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1526.12s)]
*  I mean, I think Trump actually can [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1529.48s)]
*  get away with raising taxes on [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1531.3999999999999s)]
*  the highest earners in the country, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1532.96s)]
*  raise revenue for [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1535.0s)]
*  the federal government, and [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1536.0s)]
*  still present himself as a working [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1537.72s)]
*  class hero. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1539.6399999999999s)]
*  Because he's not raising taxes [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1540.3999999999999s)]
*  under these plans that [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1542.08s)]
*  we're talking about. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1543.24s)]
*  It's not like he's advocating to [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1544.48s)]
*  raise taxes on working class [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1546.1799999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1547.72s)]
*  But I don't think he's going to end [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1548.24s)]
*  up raising taxes on anyone, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1550.52s)]
*  to be quite honest with you. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1552.36s)]
*  And I think that's going to be [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1554.5s)]
*  the case because of the influencing [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1556.28s)]
*  figures within the administration, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1558.42s)]
*  and more importantly, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1560.72s)]
*  what's going down over at [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1562.02s)]
*  Capitol Hill. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1563.46s)]
*  Because we're already hearing a lot [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1564.9s)]
*  of pushback from people like [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1566.78s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1568.14s)]
*  Now, can Trump bully him if Trump [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1569.54s)]
*  actually wants to raise taxes on [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1571.1s)]
*  the rich? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1572.6200000000001s)]
*  Maybe, yeah, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1573.3s)]
*  I think that's possible. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1574.02s)]
*  But no, I mean, when you listen to [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1575.6200000000001s)]
*  what Johnson's saying, he seems [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1578.22s)]
*  like he will be undeterred. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1580.82s)]
*  He will not sign off on higher [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1583.12s)]
*  taxes for his donors, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1585.36s)]
*  I mean, the richest among us. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1586.9399999999998s)]
*  So let's hear a little [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1589.66s)]
*  from his interview recently. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1593.44s)]
*  I believe it was on Fox News, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1600.5800000000002s)]
*  if I'm not mistaken. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1603.2800000000002s)]
*  Here's what Mike Johnson has [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1605.6200000000001s)]
*  to say about the possibility of [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1607.5800000000002s)]
*  Congress passing a tax hike on [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1609.8000000000002s)]
*  the rich. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1612.14s)]
*  Eating man is management ain't [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1612.9s)]
*  a tax hike on the rich. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1618.16s)]
*  There have been some reports out there that the Trump administration is looking at pushing [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1621.02s)]
*  the top tax rate for those making over a million dollars back up towards 39, 40%. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1625.24s)]
*  Is that something that we should expect from a Republican bill? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1630.94s)]
*  I would not expect that. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1636.2s)]
*  We have been working against that idea. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1637.66s)]
*  I'm not in favor of raising the tax rates because our party is the group that stands [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1640.0s)]
*  against that traditionally. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1645.14s)]
*  So there were lots of ideas thrown out on the table along this process over the last [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1646.62s)]
*  year. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1649.8999999999999s)]
*  But I would just say for everybody, just wait and see. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1650.8999999999999s)]
*  There's more details coming and I think you're gonna be very pleased by what you see. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1654.26s)]
*  I don't think we're raising taxes on anybody. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1657.1799999999998s)]
*  What we're trying to do is prevent the largest tax increase in US history. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1659.06s)]
*  Was that tinted lip balm? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1664.3799999999999s)]
*  His lips were very rosy looking. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1666.78s)]
*  Anyway, I'm not surprised at all that Mike Johnson is not in favor of raising taxes on [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1668.58s)]
*  the rich. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1672.82s)]
*  His campaigns are funded by the rich. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1673.82s)]
*  Do not want to see their taxes go up. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1676.38s)]
*  And joining him are the who's who of neoliberal Republicans, including Senator Dave McCormick [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1679.22s)]
*  from Pennsylvania, Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1684.8600000000001s)]
*  And so again, with the pushback in Capitol Hill with the fact that there are close Trump [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1687.82s)]
*  allies discouraging him from raising taxes on the rich, I genuinely predict that it's [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1693.34s)]
*  not gonna happen. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1698.14s)]
*  But I'm at least having a little bit of fun with the panic that we're seeing among the [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1700.14s)]
*  opponents to these tax hikes. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1704.3799999999999s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about Steve Moore, little more about Steve Moore because he's [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1707.02s)]
*  hilarious man. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1712.58s)]
*  So he's totally losing it over the idea that a Republican administration might raise taxes [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1713.62s)]
*  on the rich. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1719.54s)]
*  He says quote, this is a potential crisis in the party. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1720.54s)]
*  It sounds like Bernie Sanders economics. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1726.54s)]
*  In fact, some have especially soured on Vice President JD Vance because of his economic [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1730.5s)]
*  populism, which actually appears to be somewhat sincere. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1737.38s)]
*  So Vance's openness to higher taxes in some circumstances has provoked alarm among some [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1741.6200000000001s)]
*  conservatives given his strong position to claim the GOP presidential nomination in 2028. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1746.58s)]
*  Vance in 2023 said he opposes further cuts to the corporate tax rate, which the president's [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1753.82s)]
*  2017 tax law lowered from 35% to 21%. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1759.86s)]
*  While in the Senate, Vance also explored bipartisan measures to close tax loopholes for large [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1764.4199999999998s)]
*  businesses. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1770.06s)]
*  So I love watching the panic, I really do. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1772.62s)]
*  Even though I'm not dumb enough to think, I'm not naive enough to think that a Republican [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1776.22s)]
*  administration is going to push for high taxes or higher taxes on the richest Americans. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1780.86s)]
*  Still though, the idea that there are diverse thoughts, diverse opinions within the administration, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1788.9s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1797.6200000000001s)]
*  I really do. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1799.26s)]
*  And who knows, maybe that very, very small, that minuscule populist wing of the Trump [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1800.74s)]
*  administration could grow into something bigger in the future, who knows? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1806.8600000000001s)]
*  Either way, I think that both parties are realizing that there is real anger in the [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1811.94s)]
*  country among working people who have gotten a raw deal for many, many decades. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1817.82s)]
*  Wages stagnant since the 1970s. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1823.22s)]
*  Americans are unable to buy homes. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1827.42s)]
*  When we talk about the American dream being dead, every facet of life has become far too [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1829.66s)]
*  expensive. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1835.02s)]
*  And people look at the small group of people who get to hoard all the wealth and they're [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1836.58s)]
*  angered by it. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1840.3s)]
*  Now talking about raising taxes is one thing. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1842.1s)]
*  And I think the mistake that the left makes is we just kind of leave it at that. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1845.86s)]
*  We have the debate about how we need to raise taxes and then we move on. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1850.5s)]
*  I think we need to have a better conversation, a real debate about where those resources [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1853.62s)]
*  end up going as well. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1858.56s)]
*  Because there is, in my opinion, a lot of waste in the government. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1860.86s)]
*  And I'm not talking about social services and things like that. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1865.7s)]
*  I'm talking about funding wars abroad. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1868.58s)]
*  I'm talking about defense contracts with these private defense contractors who obviously, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1871.22s)]
*  I think that they overestimate, I'll put it that way, the amount of money it costs to [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1879.3000000000002s)]
*  develop various weapons that the government contracts with them to obtain. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1886.42s)]
*  There's just a lot of grift going on in the federal government. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1892.5800000000002s)]
*  And when there's grift going on in the federal government, you and I are the ones who get [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1895.24s)]
*  screwed over. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1898.4s)]
*  It's our tax money. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1899.4s)]
*  And by the way, the other thing is, I think the Medicare system should negotiate drug [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1900.92s)]
*  prices for all pharmaceutical drugs, not for a handful for all pharmaceutical drugs. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1904.48s)]
*  It is so incredibly unjust that we are being price gouged by pharmaceutical companies. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1910.1200000000001s)]
*  We all know it, the federal government knows it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1916.6000000000001s)]
*  In fact, the federal government allows it to happen. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1918.76s)]
*  So if Trump really wants to find some cost savings, how about start with the pharmaceutical [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1921.4s)]
*  drug prices and allow Medicare to negotiate those prices so they're not being price gouged? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1927.32s)]
*  I doubt he's gonna do that, but there are some real ways to save money. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1933.76s)]
*  It's just that Republican benefactors, donors, they're not fans of those strategies, so unlikely [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1937.76s)]
*  to happen. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1946.04s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1947.04s)]
*  When we come back, we'll talk about the Supreme Court and its likely decision on allowing [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1948.04s)]
*  parents to opt their children out of curriculum that touches on LGBTQ issues. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1952.8799999999999s)]
*  We'll probably cover it on the show tomorrow, but Senator John Federer, who's the president [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1957.8799999999999s)]
*  is urging Donald Trump to absolutely destroy Iran, not just bomb it, but make it a wasteland. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1983.04s)]
*  Anyway, if you had told me back when John Federman was running for a Senate seat, that [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=1992.04s)]
*  I would agree more with Tucker Carlson than Federman on foreign policy, I wouldn't believe [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2001.6s)]
*  you, but here we are. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2009.68s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2011.14s)]
*  On Iran in particular, I think Tucker is totally right in regard to avoiding a hot war with [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2012.14s)]
*  Iran, but Federman would love it. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2019.14s)]
*  And by the way, make it a wasteland, destroy Iran as if there aren't any innocent civilians [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2022.3400000000001s)]
*  living there, as if there aren't any infants, babies, children, innocent women, elderly [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2027.18s)]
*  people living there. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2031.96s)]
*  Federman is a disgusting human being. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2032.96s)]
*  Anyway, we might cover that on the show tomorrow, but for now, let's check in with the United [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2035.18s)]
*  State Supreme Court. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2039.86s)]
*  Whale El Khoshyary is homeschooling his fourth grade daughter. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2040.86s)]
*  Treehouse, two words. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2045.86s)]
*  After he says the public schools in Montgomery County, Maryland infringed on their Muslim [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2047.82s)]
*  faith. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2052.38s)]
*  The teachings he objects to involve classroom readings of books like these, featuring stories [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2053.38s)]
*  with gay, lesbian, and transgender themes. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2058.7s)]
*  They were love stories. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2061.88s)]
*  So it was not just exposure to LGBTQ characters. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2062.88s)]
*  We're talking specifically about family life and sexuality issues where some kids aren't [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2068.42s)]
*  really prepared to learn about these things. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2074.86s)]
*  The United States Supreme Court will soon decide whether public schools have to provide [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2079.06s)]
*  an opportunity for religious parents to opt their children out of school lessons that [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2084.7400000000002s)]
*  pertain to sexuality or information about the LGBTQ community. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2091.58s)]
*  So for context, what is this case about? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2097.38s)]
*  How did this case develop? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2100.9s)]
*  Well, it all kind of started with the Montgomery public schools. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2102.26s)]
*  They expanded their English language arts curriculum back in 2022 to include books with [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2105.9s)]
*  LGBTQ plus characters as part of an effort to better reflect the diversity of families [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2111.56s)]
*  in the countries or counties religiously diverse and politically liberal population. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2117.7400000000002s)]
*  So there is a list of mandatory books or books that teachers are told to use during this [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2125.04s)]
*  instruction. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2134.04s)]
*  Two of the books kept coming up during the Supreme Court hearing on this. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2135.04s)]
*  One of them was Uncle Bobby's Wedding, which is about a girl who finds out that her favorite [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2141.0s)]
*  uncle is getting married to another man. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2145.54s)]
*  And then there's Love Violet, which tells the story of a young girl who has a crush [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2148.32s)]
*  on her female classmates. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2153.2s)]
*  Now I think the age of the students that would be consuming this content or these books is [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2155.2s)]
*  important here, right? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2162.6s)]
*  We're not talking about high school students or middle school students. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2163.72s)]
*  The students are in fourth grade and fifth grade, which as you can understand, led to [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2166.3199999999997s)]
*  some parents having concerns about it. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2171.16s)]
*  But this isn't an attempt to ban the books. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2174.44s)]
*  This is about giving parents the ability to simply opt their children out of the lessons [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2177.4s)]
*  in which these types of books are being utilized. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2183.92s)]
*  And so basically the school or school system, I should say Montgomery Public Schools in [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2187.0s)]
*  Maryland, initially did give the parents the opportunity to opt their children out. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2194.2400000000002s)]
*  But then they reneged and that's what led to this lawsuit against the school district. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2200.52s)]
*  So Montgomery County is an extreme outlier, according to the lawyer representing the parents, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2205.96s)]
*  in this case the plaintiffs, insisting that every elementary school student must be instructed [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2212.36s)]
*  that among other controversial matters, doctors guessed at their sex when they were born and [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2216.82s)]
*  that anyone who disagrees is hurtful and unfair, said Eric Baxter, senior counsel for the [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2222.7200000000003s)]
*  Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2229.7000000000003s)]
*  And so after the parents were told, yeah, you can't opt your kids out of this, a coalition [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2232.88s)]
*  of parents from a variety of religious backgrounds. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2237.6800000000003s)]
*  This isn't just some far right Christian group that's trying to ban books. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2241.2000000000003s)]
*  There are Muslim parents who are concerned about this, obviously Christian parents as [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2245.96s)]
*  well. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2250.88s)]
*  So this coalition got together and started protesting what the school district was doing. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2252.08s)]
*  And then three couples and the organization Kids First ended up suing. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2257.56s)]
*  So this case makes its way up to the Supreme Court and just recently the Supreme Court [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2265.46s)]
*  heard arguments both for and against allowing parents to opt their children out. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2269.58s)]
*  All right, so that's the context. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2275.38s)]
*  Now let's talk about what happened during the hearing because I thought there were some [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2276.94s)]
*  really interesting moments you should know about. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2279.58s)]
*  So justices Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito, so a liberal and a conservative, sparred [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2281.96s)]
*  over the very nature of the books that were used or will be used. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2288.6s)]
*  And whether they're controversial or inappropriate, specifically for elementary school kids. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2293.32s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2297.76s)]
*  Is there any affidavit from any parent that merely looking at people getting married, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2299.7200000000003s)]
*  holding hands, none of them are even kissing in any of these books. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2306.2400000000002s)]
*  The most they're doing is holding hands. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2311.1s)]
*  They remove away from the book that Justice Sotomayor was referring to, Uncle Bobby's [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2313.2s)]
*  Wedding. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2319.3199999999997s)]
*  I've read that book as well as a lot of these other books. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2320.3199999999997s)]
*  Do you think it's fair to say that all that is done in Uncle Bobby's Wedding is to expose [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2322.84s)]
*  children to the fact that there are men who marry other men? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2328.52s)]
*  No, Your Honor, and this court in Obergefell promised that parents would be able to continue [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  to teach what this court called decent and honorable beliefs that same sex marriage is [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2337.2s)]
*  immoral according to their beliefs. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2341.2799999999997s)]
*  And it's a far stretch from that for schools to compel students to attend. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2343.2799999999997s)]
*  Parents are paying taxes that they have to pay a threat of criminal fines or penalties [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2347.04s)]
*  or the expense of private school. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2350.8999999999996s)]
*  And then to have teachers telling them things that are directly contrary to their beliefs. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2353.2s)]
*  The book has a clear message. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2357.72s)]
*  And a lot of people think it's a good message and maybe it is a good message. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2359.9199999999996s)]
*  But it's a message that a lot of people who hold on to traditional religious beliefs don't [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2363.16s)]
*  agree with. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2369.16s)]
*  So Justice Alito, he's making an argument in regard to religious beliefs, yes. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2371.7599999999998s)]
*  But put that aside because I think what he's also touching on that's really relevant to [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2377.8399999999997s)]
*  the arguments being made here is the fact that it's not just simply that these books [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2382.08s)]
*  have characters that happen to be gay. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2387.64s)]
*  It's that they have an overarching message that pushes acceptance or yeah, acceptance [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2390.08s)]
*  toward gay marriage or whatever that religious folks have issues with. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2398.96s)]
*  And so it's the nature of the books that Alito feels that the liberal justices are just kind [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2404.7799999999997s)]
*  of minimizing. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2412.64s)]
*  Whereas in reality, these books bring up some issues in regard to ideology, right? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2414.84s)]
*  In regard to pushing a certain take on gay marriage. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2420.76s)]
*  Now look, I'm 100% in favor of gay marriage. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2427.28s)]
*  I have absolutely no problem with gay marriage. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2430.88s)]
*  And if I had children, I would not have a problem with them consuming that type of material. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2432.88s)]
*  I think there's nothing wrong with these books. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2438.2200000000003s)]
*  Let's just put it that way. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2439.6000000000004s)]
*  I would be deeply, deeply concerned if this were a situation in which the religious parents [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2441.04s)]
*  were trying to be the arbiters of what all the students can learn. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2449.5600000000004s)]
*  But that's not what's happening here. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2455.2400000000002s)]
*  They're not calling for the banning of these books from the school district. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2456.84s)]
*  They're not calling for the banning of this type of curriculum in the school district. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2461.0s)]
*  They're simply saying, these are our sincerely held religious beliefs. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2466.44s)]
*  These are the books that are being used for our kids in fourth grade and fifth grade. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2473.44s)]
*  We're not ready to broach these conversations with our kids yet. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2477.2000000000003s)]
*  And we're not comfortable with them learning about these things yet, especially when it [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2480.42s)]
*  butts up against our religious beliefs. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2484.8s)]
*  So we just like to opt our kids out. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2486.44s)]
*  And the school district's like, no, it's too difficult for us to do. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2489.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't agree with the school district on that, to be honest with you. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2493.46s)]
*  Because while I'm not religious, I think it's important to protect religious liberty in [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2496.1000000000004s)]
*  this country. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2501.02s)]
*  You want public schools, which are funded by everyone and they're universally available [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2502.02s)]
*  for everyone, to be a welcoming environment for people of all faiths, all beliefs. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2505.98s)]
*  And if there are very narrow situations in which the lesson plan butts up against religious [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2512.0600000000004s)]
*  beliefs, I think the parents should have the ability, especially in elementary school, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2521.3799999999997s)]
*  to opt their children out. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2526.22s)]
*  So, but there's more because surprisingly, this is really surprising, Justice Elena Kagan, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2528.2999999999997s)]
*  who's a liberal justice, seemed to agree with Samuel Alito in regard to the nature of the [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2534.4599999999996s)]
*  book. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2540.18s)]
*  So let's take a look at that. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2541.18s)]
*  I want to take you back to some of the questions that Justice Alito was asking, because I too [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2544.18s)]
*  was struck by, these are young kids, picture books, and on matters concerning sexuality. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2549.1s)]
*  I suspect there are a lot of non-religious parents who weren't all that thrilled about [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2557.98s)]
*  this and then you add in religion and that's even more serious. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2561.98s)]
*  So she's acknowledging, yeah, the material here is sensitive material, it's sexual in [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2573.42s)]
*  nature and even if you're not a religious parent, you might not be thrilled with your [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2579.42s)]
*  fourth grader or fifth grader. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2584.7000000000003s)]
*  Reading these types of books or looking at the images in these books as part of the elementary [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2587.14s)]
*  school curriculum. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2591.5s)]
*  But I should note that Kagan also has a problem with the potential slippery slope nature of [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2593.2200000000003s)]
*  allowing parents to opt out of certain lesson plans. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2600.92s)]
*  So Kagan worried about the sweeping implications of a Supreme Court ruling that gives parents [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2604.32s)]
*  a broad right to pick and choose across the school curriculum. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2608.84s)]
*  Once we say something like what you're asking us to say, she told the lawyer for the parents, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2612.96s)]
*  that's Eric Baxter, it will be like opt outs for everyone. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2618.1600000000003s)]
*  So she's making a slippery slope argument, which gives you a sense of where her decision [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2623.28s)]
*  is likely to head in for the ultimate ruling for this. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2628.16s)]
*  But the conservative justices as we all know outnumbered the liberal justices. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2633.48s)]
*  So they seem poised to allow parents to opt out. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2637.72s)]
*  Now conservative justices repeatedly pressed Alan Schoenfeld who is the lawyer for the [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2641.48s)]
*  school system. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2646.5s)]
*  On why the school system can't be accommodating to parents who just want to opt their kids [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2647.92s)]
*  out of these lessons. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2652.08s)]
*  Let's take a look at how that went down. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2653.64s)]
*  Well, the plaintiffs here are not asking the school to change its curriculum. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2656.48s)]
*  They're just saying, look, we want out. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2661.4s)]
*  Why isn't that feasible? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2663.64s)]
*  What is the big deal about allowing them to opt out of this? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2665.36s)]
*  Why can't this all be put? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2668.76s)]
*  We're gonna read Uncle Bobby's Wedding and these other books, but we're gonna read it [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2670.36s)]
*  during a period of time that includes the health class. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2674.4s)]
*  And children are already able to opt out of that so they can opt out of reading these [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2678.52s)]
*  books. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2683.72s)]
*  So it's a constitutional obligation to treat these books that introduce people to LGBT [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2684.72s)]
*  characters in a curriculum that is meant to teach about different matters. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2688.16s)]
*  I'm not understanding why it's not feasible. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2692.24s)]
*  The county had an opt out, he said. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2696.0s)]
*  Every other school board in the country has opt outs for all sorts of things. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2698.7599999999998s)]
*  The county has opt outs for all sorts of things. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2703.16s)]
*  The other Maryland counties have opt outs for all sorts of things. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2705.56s)]
*  And yet for this one thing, they changed in mid year and say no more opt outs. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2709.72s)]
*  I'm just not understanding feasibility. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2715.72s)]
*  So based on that line of questioning from the conservative justices, the legal experts [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2720.3599999999997s)]
*  who have weighed in on this hearing have predicted that by the summertime, the Supreme Court [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2725.48s)]
*  is very likely going to rule in favor of the plaintiffs here. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2731.48s)]
*  Those are the parents who want the ability to opt out of these very specific lessons. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2735.12s)]
*  But look, one final thing that I'll say is, I gotta give conservatives credit because [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2740.02s)]
*  they were right in a different prediction that they made all the way back in 2008. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2744.56s)]
*  And what was that prediction? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2749.56s)]
*  Well, at that time, the country was debating the idea of legalizing gay marriage, which [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2750.56s)]
*  didn't get legalized until years later. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2757.52s)]
*  But nonetheless, one of the arguments that conservatives kept making was they want to [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2759.44s)]
*  teach your elementary school kids about gay marriage. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2764.72s)]
*  And everyone on the left accused them of just fear mongering. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2768.04s)]
*  But now it seems like they want to teach elementary school kids about gay marriage, which again, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2772.14s)]
*  I personally wouldn't have a problem with if I had children, right? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2776.24s)]
*  But I know that a lot of parents would have a problem with that. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2780.94s)]
*  And I do think that it's okay to give them an opportunity to opt out of those very specific [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2784.24s)]
*  lesson plans if there really is a violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2790.72s)]
*  But I'm curious what you all think. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2796.96s)]
*  Leave some comments in the comments section. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2798.48s)]
*  I really am curious what people think. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2801.6s)]
*  I think it's totally reasonable to allow parents to opt out, but you might disagree. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2803.12s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to hearing from you. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2806.3399999999997s)]
*  For now, we're gonna take a quick break. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2808.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2809.0s)]
*  Let's get right to our next story. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2820.64s)]
*  The Federal Trade Commission is now suing Uber. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2833.52s)]
*  Uber and CEO, Derek Kusrashahi, each reportedly donated $1 million to the president's inaugural [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2836.8799999999997s)]
*  fund. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2843.0s)]
*  And Uber spokesperson telling CNBC the company is disappointed by the FTC's complaint, but [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2844.0s)]
*  is confident the courts will rule in its favor, Joe. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2848.32s)]
*  So I think for all those folks who thought that- [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2851.56s)]
*  That's not why. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2854.52s)]
*  They could be just patriotic and want to participate in the inauguration of the US president. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2858.28s)]
*  Stop being so cynical. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2863.36s)]
*  Andrew Ross Sorkin and Joe Kiernan hate each other, and it's the most entertaining thing [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2866.76s)]
*  to watch. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2872.6800000000003s)]
*  It really is. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2873.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's not really what this story is about. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2874.6800000000003s)]
*  But this little tiff that they have about the influence of money in politics is just [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2877.0s)]
*  chef's kiss. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2882.52s)]
*  Because Andrew Ross Sorkin understands how the legalized bribery that's now been baked [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2884.2s)]
*  into our political system, how that all works. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2888.88s)]
*  And his co-host wants to deny it. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2891.92s)]
*  So let's just watch a little bit more, a little bit more from their exchange, and then we'll [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2894.2s)]
*  get to the details of this FTC lawsuit. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2897.4s)]
*  I'm gonna start drawing the line at some of the cynicism, okay? [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2900.0s)]
*  We've gotta move on. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2904.96s)]
*  We've gotta come together. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2906.16s)]
*  We've gotta come together. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2907.2799999999997s)]
*  We've been apart for, remember HW? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2908.88s)]
*  Gotta come together. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2911.88s)]
*  Dana Carvey, we've been apart. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2913.88s)]
*  Coming up. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2916.72s)]
*  Let me tell you, I spoke to so many CEOs who wrote those checks. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2917.72s)]
*  And they wanted something? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2921.16s)]
*  Who will privately tell you exactly what they think, which is that this was a down payment. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2923.84s)]
*  And all I'm suggesting to you is it was a down payment on nothing. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2931.02s)]
*  Is the down payment on the rug being pulled out from collectively from under? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2934.92s)]
*  Good, these corporate fat cats. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2939.6s)]
*  Joe, no one loves those corporate fat cats more than you do. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2943.6800000000003s)]
*  Come on, come on. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2948.8s)]
*  Obviously, those massive donations to the Trump administration were meant to prevent [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2950.7200000000003s)]
*  this type of lawsuit being filed against Uber. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2954.6800000000003s)]
*  But based on the allegations that are being made here by the Federal Trade Commission [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2959.3s)]
*  against Uber, seems like this lawsuit makes a lot of sense. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2963.92s)]
*  And I'm glad they have decided to file it. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2967.52s)]
*  So here's Andrew Ross Sorkin with some details. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2970.6s)]
*  The government claims that the ride handling company provided misleading information to [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2974.64s)]
*  users about the Uber One subscription service failed to provide a simple way to cancel memberships [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2978.16s)]
*  and charged people without their consent. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2983.88s)]
*  The move is the first FTC action against a major tech company during President Trump's [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2986.36s)]
*  second term. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2991.32s)]
*  All right, so let's talk about Uber One. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2993.88s)]
*  And this is why I'm always very skeptical of these free trial subscription service things. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=2996.6800000000003s)]
*  Because I always feel like they're looking to get you. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3002.84s)]
*  And it appears based on the allegations, which must be proven in court, obviously, they really [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3006.1600000000003s)]
*  did screw over some of their customers. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3012.42s)]
*  So the Uber One subscription service offers users, or it's supposed to offer users zero [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3014.6800000000003s)]
*  food and grocery delivery, 6% credit back on every ride and exclusive promotional offers. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3021.04s)]
*  Now FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson argues that Americans are tired of getting signed up for [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3027.6s)]
*  unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3034.24s)]
*  The Trump vans FTC is fighting back on behalf of the American people. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3037.62s)]
*  Okay, now what are the allegations here? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3041.88s)]
*  So Uber told users that Uber One would give users $25 per month or save users $25 per [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3045.12s)]
*  month in savings. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3054.96s)]
*  The FTC has found that that is untrue. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3057.0s)]
*  Obviously, it depends on how much you use the app in order to get those savings. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3060.48s)]
*  So that allegations a little bit shaky, but there's more. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3064.92s)]
*  Uber promised free trials for its users, but would charge them anyway before the trial [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3069.64s)]
*  period ended. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3075.7999999999997s)]
*  Now if the FTC proves that in court, that is super shady and super gross. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3078.0s)]
*  Now Uber told users they could cancel Uber One at any time, but they also made the process [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3083.56s)]
*  incredibly difficult to do so, absurdly difficult. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3090.56s)]
*  In fact, in some cases requiring users to go through 23 screens and take 32 actions [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3093.8s)]
*  to actually cancel the service. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3100.84s)]
*  Honestly, since you can do that online and remotely, I don't even see that as burdensome [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3103.8s)]
*  as canceling a gym membership in some cases where you literally have to fill out a form [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3109.4s)]
*  and go to a location, physical location to give the person the form to cancel your gym [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3114.84s)]
*  membership. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3121.0800000000004s)]
*  Have you ever had that happen? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3122.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm not driving anywhere after work, okay? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3123.2799999999997s)]
*  So I still have the gym membership, it's still there. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3125.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm paying for it, haven't been in, I don't know, over a year. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3127.68s)]
*  If a user was within 48 hours of getting billed for their subscription, Uber would remove [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3131.08s)]
*  the option for them to cancel and tell users to contact customer service instead. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3137.12s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3143.04s)]
*  The wait times were disastrous, incredibly long and sometimes kept users from canceling [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3144.04s)]
*  before the billing date. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3149.88s)]
*  The FTC said those practices violate the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Restore Online [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3152.32s)]
*  Shoppers Confidence Act, which requires online sellers to clearly disclose certain terms, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3158.48s)]
*  obtain consumers consent before charging for a service, and provide a simple way to cancel [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3163.36s)]
*  a recurring subscription. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3168.84s)]
*  So this is a silver lining. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3171.92s)]
*  This is a little bit of good news in this massive wave of bad news that we've been dealing [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3174.48s)]
*  with in the country. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3179.6000000000004s)]
*  I loved Lena Conn as the Federal Trade Commission chair. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3181.04s)]
*  I was really sad to see that Trump let her go and replaced her. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3184.08s)]
*  But even so, it looks like the FTC is still doing some good work. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3188.44s)]
*  And if Uber is in fact engaging in this predatory activity against its own customers, they should [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3193.44s)]
*  be brought to justice. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3200.04s)]
*  And I especially love the fact that these executives paid Donald Trump a nice hefty [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3201.96s)]
*  amount for his campaign and didn't seem to get the protection they were expecting from [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3206.88s)]
*  an FTC lawsuit. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3211.92s)]
*  So we'll see how it plays out. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3214.96s)]
*  I would be really sad if the FTC ends up dropping this for some reason. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3215.96s)]
*  These are some pretty significant allegations against Uber. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3220.1600000000003s)]
*  We'll see if this lawsuit goes anywhere. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3223.04s)]
*  For now, we're gonna take a quick break. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3225.04s)]
*  When we come back, Cenk Uygur joins us for a big announcement. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WxXGQA9xYg&t=3226.04s)]
