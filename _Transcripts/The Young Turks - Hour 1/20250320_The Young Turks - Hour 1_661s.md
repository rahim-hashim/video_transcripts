# REPORT: Pentagon Preparing For Nuclear War with Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI)
*  The Pentagon has begun preparations for a potential war with Iran. And that's according to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=0.0s)]
*  reports that are coming from Ken Klippenstein, a former colleague of TYT, and someone who's now [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=6.16s)]
*  writing independently over at Substack. And they're even considering apparently a scenario [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=12.16s)]
*  in which nuclear weapons could be used. So let's break this down. Let's see what the sources are. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Let's see how much reality there is behind that possibility. So on Tuesday, Klippenstein reported [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=24.64s)]
*  that Pentagon and company contracting documents that he had obtained describe a unique joint [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=30.8s)]
*  staff planning effort underway in Washington and in the Middle East to refine the next generation [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  of a major regional conflict with Iran. So that planning effort is basically being referred to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  as a SEAD project. That's what they've dubbed it. Part of the reason why the project exists is that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=54.48s)]
*  the Pentagon is reevaluating Iran's war capabilities. I hope they're taking their time in reevaluating [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=60.48s)]
*  Iran's war capabilities. I hope they're maybe a little more competent than what we experienced [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=69.52s)]
*  during the Bush administration, but please make no mistake about it. The neocons are back. Okay, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=75.44s)]
*  they're in charge. Don't let anyone think for a second that the Trump Pentagon is any different [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=81.36s)]
*  from the Bush era Pentagon. Full to the rim, okay, with these neocons who are just salivating for a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  war with Iran. And they're literally talking about the potential of nuclear weapons. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=95.68s)]
*  Okay, so let me continue. While the Pentagon is no longer concerned that Iran could launch a ground [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=101.2s)]
*  invasion of their neighboring countries, which should be the most important thing, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=106.72s)]
*  They are worried about the combination of narrow pinprick attacks by proxies, Iran's various [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=112.48s)]
*  covert and influence campaigns, and its use and proliferation of long range drones and missiles, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=119.68s)]
*  especially to Russia. So US Central Command or CENTCOM is the Pentagon's regional command [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=126.64s)]
*  that oversees the Middle East specifically. And it's also the division that is working on [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=133.6s)]
*  the war plans, or war plans, I should say, against Iran. So one document in that plan warns of the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=139.04s)]
*  distinct possibility of the war escalating outside of the United States government's intention and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=146.88s)]
*  impacting the rest of the region, demanding a multifaceted approach. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=154.4s)]
*  And so according to a retired senior military officer who was actually briefed on these plans, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=160.0s)]
*  they include the possibility of using nuclear weapons. So let me just pause and say, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  for the young men who were concerned about the continuation of the Biden administration [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=172.96s)]
*  through the election of Kamala Harris, these were the same people who were concerned about World [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=179.28s)]
*  War III, about things getting so out of control that maybe the United States would even consider [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=184.24s)]
*  re-implementing a draft. They were worried about the possibility of nuclear war, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  not in regard to Israel and Iran or the Middle East. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=196.24s)]
*  They were concerned that nuclear war would break out as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  But now you have the Trump administration, and we're hearing from the Pentagon in the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump administration that they're considering scenarios in which nuclear weapons might be part [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=210.96s)]
*  of the scenario. Okay, but let's just go back to what that retired senior military officer said. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  One might find it extraordinary to think that nuclear weapons are even considered, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  the officer tells us, but we have entered a new era. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't love the fact that I keep thinking about Tucker Carlson of all people being correct on the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  issue of Iran and urging the Trump administration to avoid engaging in a war with Iran on behalf of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  Israel, but we're gonna do it anyway. Because Tucker Carlson doesn't own the government. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  Tucker Carlson doesn't own the government. The Israel lobby owns the government. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=258.8s)]
*  And who cares about American soldiers? They're expendable. Who cares about [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=263.44000000000005s)]
*  civilian lives? I mean, anything for the Israel lobby, anything. Okay, there's more. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=267.12s)]
*  The officer stated that the nuclear plans aren't necessarily related to Donald Trump's reelection. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Rather, that these would be the three reasons for reintroducing nuclear deterrent. So the argument [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=280.56s)]
*  here is it's not like Trump's over at the Pentagon telling them, you should threaten nuclear weapons [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=286.72s)]
*  or the use of nuclear weapons against Iran. But nonetheless, I mean, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=291.04s)]
*  who's the head of the Pentagon right now? Who are the individuals within the Trump administration [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  who have only escalated the conflict in the Middle East? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  Certainly with this notion that we should take over the Gaza Strip, ethnically cleanse the Gaza [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=309.04s)]
*  Strip of Palestinians. I mean, it's just, but anyway, so here are the three reasons for [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=314.8s)]
*  reintroducing nuclear deterrence according to the Pentagon. So to directly deter Iran from [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  developing nuclear weapons or then from using them. A great way of doing that would be to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=325.36s)]
*  re-implement the Iran nuclear deal, which prevented them from developing nuclear weapons. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  So if you don't wanna blame Trump, I'm sorry, the president who actually ripped up the Iran nuclear [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=336.64s)]
*  deal was Donald Trump. But let me continue to convince Israel not to use its own nuclear weapons, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=343.12s)]
*  that is by making it clear that the US equally would or could preempt Iran if something dire [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=349.44s)]
*  happened. Also to dissuade Saudi Arabia from perceiving that it has to develop its own nuclear [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=355.76s)]
*  weapons because Iran is doing so. So here are the scenarios in which the United States would [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=361.44s)]
*  authorize the use of nuclear weapons against Iran according to these plans. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=367.52s)]
*  So one, with the CENTCOM commander requesting the use of nuclear weapons mostly to stave off Iranian [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=373.36s)]
*  conventional military success. And two, in a top-down order that is by the president, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=380.88s)]
*  mostly as a demonstration to signal to Iran. In other words, the red button could very well be [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  in Donald Trump's hands or his decision to use nuclear weapons could be. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=395.6s)]
*  So tensions are rising as Iran pushes back against the Trump administration. For instance, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=401.2s)]
*  two weeks ago, Trump wrote a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei. That's Iran's supreme leader, a theocrat. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=406.32s)]
*  Now, he sends this letter as a gesture to start talks about the country's nuclear program. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=414.32s)]
*  And according to reports, the letter contained a two-month deadline to reach a new nuclear deal. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=420.32s)]
*  He could have kept the old nuclear deal in place, but Obama negotiated it and Trump has to reverse [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=426.56s)]
*  anything a Democratic president does, even if the Democratic president actually secured a win. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=432.56s)]
*  In this case, the Iran nuclear deal was a win, but make no mistake about it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu doesn't want an Iran nuclear deal. He wants the US to go to war against Iran on [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=444.48s)]
*  his behalf. And make no mistake, we will do it. I have no doubt at this point that we're gonna do [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=449.92s)]
*  it. It's so unhinged and so ridiculous, even as the Pentagon acknowledges that Iran's not looking [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=455.76s)]
*  to do any kind of ground invasion against one of its neighboring countries. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=463.04s)]
*  I mean, just think about the military capability and the defense capacity that Israel has. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, and we're still having a conversation, given what the Pentagon has acknowledged [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=476.0s)]
*  about doing a war against Iran, engaging in war against Iran. Okay, great. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=481.84s)]
*  Anyway, so the letter was publicly rejected by both Khamenei and Iran's president, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=490.08s)]
*  the supreme leader, the Grand Ayatollah says that the insistence of some bullying [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  on negotiations is not to resolve issues. Talks for them are a pathway to have new demands. It is [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=501.44s)]
*  not only about Iran's nuclear issue, and that's not all. So, nor news. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=508.56s)]
*  An outlet affiliated with Iran's Supreme National Security Council said there will be no guarantee [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=516.32s)]
*  Iran will not abandon the nonproliferation treaty if Trump and his team, including the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=522.96s)]
*  U.S. military, keep threatening them. And that's bad news, given the state of Iran's nuclear [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=529.76s)]
*  advancements. Although, given the reporter here, Barack Ravid, who seems to just serve as a [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=536.16s)]
*  stenographer, I would kind of take these numbers with a grain of salt. I mean, I would want to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=543.04s)]
*  find a different way of confirming them. But this is what's being claimed, that Iran's nuclear [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  program has advanced over the past four years, and it is closer than ever to producing a nuclear [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=551.6s)]
*  weapon. Its stockpile of 60% enriched uranium is enough for six nuclear bombs if enriched to 90%. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=557.44s)]
*  And that's according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. So, look, there's always been a lot [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=565.2800000000001s)]
*  of fear mongering about Iran. And that fear mongering tends to come specifically from the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=570.32s)]
*  Israeli government that sees Iran as a threat, wants us to use our resources and human lives [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=577.2s)]
*  in order to fight that war on their behalf. And we're gonna do it. So, I just want to be clear [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=583.04s)]
*  about that. I want to warn you about that. And the mention, the mere mention of nuclear weapons [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=587.68s)]
*  playing a role in this is absolutely and utterly disgusting. So, I have no malice toward Trump [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=594.0s)]
*  voters. These are ordinary Americans. We live in a democracy. They get to vote however they want. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  But I just hope that for those who are persuaded to vote for Trump over Harris, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=605.5999999999999s)]
*  because they were worried about war spreading, they were worried about World War III, they were [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHjLICrl5OI&t=611.4399999999999s)]
