"President Donald Trump bitterly complained that CNN ‚Äúhurt‚Äù him with bombshell reporting on the Iran airstrikes, and continued to demand they declare the mission an ‚Äúunbelievable success‚Äù on Wednesday.
Trump has been raging for days at CNN and others over coverage of a series of surprise U.S. airstrikes on nuclear sites in Iran. After the strikes, Trump quickly claimed that all of Iran‚Äôs nuclear program had been ‚Äúcompletely and totally obliterated‚Äù in the attack, but experts and his own officials were more measured and skeptical."

# Trump DEFENDS Strikes Despite Leaked Intel
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU)
*  You should really say how great our soldiers and our warriors are. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=0.0s)]
*  I think everyone appreciates our soldiers and our warriors. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=4.72s)]
*  I do have two questions for you, Mr. President. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=6.88s)]
*  You just cited Israeli intelligence on these attacks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Earlier, you said US intelligence was inconclusive. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Are you relying on Israeli intelligence for your assessment of the impact of the strikes? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=16.32s)]
*  No, this is also Iran made the statement. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=20.88s)]
*  And it's also if you read the document that was given, that Pete can talk about if you'd [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=23.68s)]
*  like. The document said it could be very severe damage, but they didn't take that. They said [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=28.24s)]
*  it could be limited or it could be very severe. They really didn't know other than to say [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  it could be limited or it could be very, very severe. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=39.16s)]
*  And you didn't choose to put that because it was very early after. Since then, we've [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=42.6s)]
*  collected additional intelligence. We've also spoken to people who have seen the site. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=46.76s)]
*  And the site is obliterated. And we think everything nuclear is down there. They didn't [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=51.84s)]
*  take it out. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=57.44s)]
*  Okay, so everything Trump said there was actually true except for that very last sentence. And [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=58.44s)]
*  I wanna be honest and accurate with you guys, right? So again, there is some indication [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=64.88s)]
*  that the Iranians had moved the enriched uranium. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=70.92s)]
*  We don't know for sure yet. I'm not saying that as if it is definitely true. But what [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=74.5s)]
*  he was saying earlier about the preliminary report and how the media seems to avoid harping [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=80.32s)]
*  on the entirety of the statement, meaning the damage could be limited or it could be [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=86.6s)]
*  extensive. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  They tend to leave the extensive part out of the preliminary report, which I think is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  hilarious and kind of tells you there seems to be this orchestrated effort to continue [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=94.52s)]
*  goading the Trump administration into a war with Iran, which I think would be a disastrous [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  situation for the Middle East, of course. And it would be disastrous for our own country [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  when we should be focused on other things. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  There were other Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=115.0s)]
*  who tried to pour cold water on this preliminary report. He says that you can't do a nuclear [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=119.88s)]
*  weapon without a conversion facility, meaning a facility to convert uranium to enriched [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  uranium. We can't even find where it is, where it used to be on the map. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=131.84s)]
*  The whole thing is blackened out. It's gone, it's wiped out. But there's also some dissent [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=136.24s)]
*  that isn't really being talked about at all within the defense and intelligence community [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  on how effective these bunker buster bombs were. So more importantly, the intel that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=149.2s)]
*  was leaked was preliminary. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=155.88s)]
*  I know I keep repeating that, but I want to really harp on it. And we should be asking [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=157.16s)]
*  why someone would leak it before investigators are able to complete their assessment in the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=161.28s)]
*  first place. Again, it's preliminary. They haven't finished their investigation. So the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=167.76s)]
*  person who leaked this, why did they leak it? What is their motivation? The analysis [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=172.88s)]
*  of the damage to the sites and the impact of the strikes on Iran's nuclear ambitions [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  is ongoing and could change as more intelligence becomes available. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=182.48s)]
*  Plus, international inspectors and nuclear experts agree that the extensive damage to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  the conversion facility created a key bottleneck in the weapons making process and agreed that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=194.12s)]
*  rebuilding it would likely take years. So I hate being in a position where I have to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=201.4s)]
*  give someone like Marco Rubio any credit at all. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  But what Marco Rubio said there in the quote that I read earlier is true. And the same [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=210.8s)]
*  report noted that the conversion facility was severely damaged. Again, that same report [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=216.36s)]
*  noted that the conversion facility was severely damaged. They concluded it will be a long [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  time before Iran comes anywhere near the capability it had before the attack. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, for those who want to believe some preliminary leaked intel from some motivated [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  staffer with an agenda over at the Pentagon, I guess have at it. Seems like you probably [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=242.44s)]
*  want to go to war with Iran, even if it's not in the best interest of anyone, including, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=247.96s)]
*  by the way, Israel. This idea that it's gonna go well for Israel is hilarious. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=252.12s)]
*  It didn't go so well when it comes to Iraq, did it? But nonetheless, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=256.2s)]
*  Joe Scarborough, of all people, had a warning. And I think it's worth listening to. Take a look. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  We also have to be cautious about being played by people inside the intel community [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=265.4s)]
*  who want to get their message out. I'm not saying that's happening here, but I remember [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=273.0s)]
*  in the last Trump term, the New York Times runs a story on the front page. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=277.4s)]
*  Somebody from the intel community said Vladimir Putin was paying for hits against US troops in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=281.32s)]
*  Afghanistan. Everybody ran with it. About six months later, they said, well, actually, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  they just had a low degree of confidence. And that's happened an awful lot. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=294.04s)]
*  This story, I mean, save it, bookmark it, because it's maybe one of the only examples [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=298.84s)]
*  of me having to give credit to people I usually vehemently disagree with. You've got Marco Rubio, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=307.56s)]
*  you've got Trump. And in this case, you also have Joe Scarborough. Joe Scarborough was correct. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=311.96s)]
*  And in fact, I myself had forgotten about that whole hoax that was reported in Trump's first [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=316.67999999999995s)]
*  term regarding Vladimir Putin paying assassins to take out US troops. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=323.64s)]
*  That ended up being debunked. So for the mainstream legacy journalists out there and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=329.4s)]
*  reporters out there, please for the love of God, just try for once in your life to not be a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  stenographer for the Pentagon. Just because something was leaked to you doesn't mean that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=341.24s)]
*  you should just regurgitate it without any skepticism at all. Now, again, we don't know [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=345.88s)]
*  what the reality is. It's a preliminary report. Investigations have not been concluded in any way, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=352.84s)]
*  shape or form. And everything to me points in the direction of this is being leaked. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=359.64s)]
*  And the Israeli intelligence mirrors the leak because war is wanted, okay? And I don't want [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=366.67999999999995s)]
*  war. The American people don't want war, as you saw from the polling that we shared with you recently. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  You had a Harry Enton showing that most Americans, vast majority of Americans, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=379.56s)]
*  do not want to go to war with Iran. They also don't want Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=382.76s)]
*  But I'll end on this. If you don't want any country to obtain a nuclear weapon or to build [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, the worst way to prevent them from building said weapon is to publicly and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=394.2s)]
*  incessantly talk about how you want regime change in their country. Going to war with that country [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=402.12s)]
*  because all that's gonna do is encourage said country, in this case, Iran, to race [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=409.08s)]
*  for a nuclear weapon. Because what is a nuclear weapon, really? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=415.8s)]
*  Now, do I think Iran is actually gonna drop a nuke on Israel? No, I don't. Do I think Iran, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  if they had a nuke, would drop it on the United States? No. You wanna know why? Because nukes [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=423.88s)]
*  are a deterrent. When you have a nuke, countries are less willing or likely to mess with you. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=429.0s)]
*  And Israel wants to mess with Iran. There's no question about it. Benjamin and Yahoo has [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=435.24s)]
*  wanted regime change in Iran forever, for literally decades, going back to the 1990s. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=439.48s)]
*  However, I would like to live in a world where there are no nuclear weapons. We don't live in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=445.72s)]
*  that world. In this scenario, you have two countries that have nukes. Obviously, the US does, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  and so does Israel. Iran is not an irrational country. As much as I don't like the Ayatollahs, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=455.24s)]
*  as much as I do not like that regime, and would love for the people of Iran organically [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=462.2s)]
*  to have a revolution that ends with the type of leadership that they want and they deserve. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=469.88s)]
*  I don't think that the current Iranian regime is irrational enough to drop a nuclear weapon [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=476.59999999999997s)]
*  on the US or Israel, because that is mutually assured destruction. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=484.52s)]
*  The 90 million people would perish, gone. You think there wouldn't be any retaliation for that, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=489.08s)]
*  and you think Iran doesn't know that. The only way to prevent Iran, in my opinion, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  from building a nuclear weapon is to engage diplomatically. Diplomacy is the only way. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=502.76s)]
*  You had inspectors going into that country under the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=511.0s)]
*  to inspect and ensure that they were not enriching enough uranium to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqgIj1p2FFU&t=517.4s)]
