# The REAL Reason Behind Trump's Gold Card Visa
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg)
*  We're gonna be selling a gold card. You have a green card, this is a gold card. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=0.0s)]
*  We're gonna be putting a price on that card of about $5 billion. And that's gonna give [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=8.08s)]
*  you green card privileges plus, it's gonna be a route to citizenship. And wealthy people will be [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=12.56s)]
*  coming into our country by buying this card. They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=19.2s)]
*  and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=24.32s)]
*  And we think it's gonna be extremely successful. It's a path to citizenship, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=28.72s)]
*  a very strong path to citizenship, but we're not doing the citizenship. For that, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=34.16s)]
*  I'd have to get Congress. Well, the Trump administration is planning a major reform to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=37.68s)]
*  the EB-5 immigrant investor visa. It's a program that basically fast-tracked wealthier individuals [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=44.8s)]
*  who wanted to come to the United States and have legal status to be in the United States. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=53.92s)]
*  Now, according to Trump, this gold card program that would replace the EB-5 immigrant investor [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  visa program, which was created in 1990, by the way, would basically have a higher [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=66.08s)]
*  monetary threshold associated with it in order for an individual to qualify for the program. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  So just a little more information about EB-5, which will be replaced with the gold card. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=78.64s)]
*  So EB-5 was primarily used by residents in Hong Kong and China who had business in the United [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=83.6s)]
*  States or wanted to have their children study in the United States. Its purpose was to basically [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  stimulate the US economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, Trump wants to replace that with something that, again, has a much higher monetary threshold. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=100.72s)]
*  But prior to that, someone applying for it would have to make the necessary investment in a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=107.52s)]
*  commercial enterprise in the US or plan to create or prepare 10 permanent full-time jobs for qualified [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=115.2s)]
*  US workers. And under the EB-5 visa, residency is granted if at least $1.05 million is invested in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=121.2s)]
*  new businesses that create jobs in the US. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=131.60000000000002s)]
*  So the idea, again, is to stimulate the economy. Now, Commerce Secretary- [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=135.68s)]
*  Yeah, that was the original idea, I hear you. This new gold card is theoretically to take [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=139.28s)]
*  care of the deficit. That's why I want to explain to you guys the real trick they're gonna do in a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  sec. Okay, so let's just do that now. Go ahead. Okay, so he says, well, look, I've got $5 million, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  we're gonna get $5 million per this gold card. And if we just had a million people buy it, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=155.28s)]
*  we'd get $5 trillion. He says, we get 10 million people to buy it. We get $50 trillion, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=162.8s)]
*  we solve the whole debt. We're done with it, okay? And so his idea is get his own side, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=166.48s)]
*  thinking, that's it, it's all solved. The gold card, that's gonna do it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=174.08s)]
*  Now, 10 million people buying at $5 million. Do you know that there's only 9 million people [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=178.56s)]
*  in the world that have more than $5 million? So it's gonna be a little bit hard to get to 10 [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=184.64s)]
*  million, cuz they don't even have it. That number doesn't even exist, let alone all 9 million buying. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  What does it make any sense either? Look, my guess is about 17 people are gonna buy this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=196.48s)]
*  And almost all Russian oligarchs, Susanna is about to explain to you. But the idea is, we cut so much [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=200.72s)]
*  and we raised so much. Don't worry about that $4.5 trillion in tax cuts for corporations. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Don't worry about it. The gold card, plus we cut malaria treatment. We're good, we're good. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=212.72s)]
*  No, it's enormous hole in deficit incoming. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=220.16s)]
*  So let's go to graphic two, because Trump did get some questions about Russian oligarchs. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=224.32s)]
*  And Trump added, it is possible Russian oligarchs could qualify for the new gold cards when asked [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=230.0s)]
*  by a journalist if those people would be eligible. Yeah, possibly. Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=235.68s)]
*  that are very nice people, he said. Sure you do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=242.16s)]
*  That's right, there's five people on both sides. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=244.88s)]
*  Yeah, sure you do. Okay, now John Hu, the founder of the John Hu Migration Consulting Firm in Hong [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=247.84s)]
*  Kong states that the total number of applicants, if the golden visa is going to replace the EB5, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=256.0s)]
*  will drop significantly. So to your point, Cenk, there aren't really [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=262.32s)]
*  a lot of people that would have the funds to basically buy their immigration status in America. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=266.08s)]
*  He said who is gonna buy this? Right, that's exactly right. I just, I don't care. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=274.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah, but by the way, that is actually, in my opinion, the correct reaction. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=281.44s)]
*  Yeah. Because if you care about it, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  if you're on the left, don't sweat it. 17 oligarchs in there, buy it, they were gonna find [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  a way in anyway, Trump was gonna find a way. They're very nice, fine people, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=293.36s)]
*  So it is what it is. Once Trump got elected, they were gonna get something, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=297.04s)]
*  So and if you're on the right, brother, just don't delude yourself into thinking this is [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  gonna cover the four and a half trillion. This is not gonna cover anything. You can quote me on it, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=306.24s)]
*  you could write it down in stone, okay? Come back and see if a million people spent [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=311.2s)]
*  five million dollars to get a green, a gold card, absolute fantasy land. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  And it's just to distract you. So Anna's right. I don't really care one way or another. Sure, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  do the gold card, but it's not gonna amount to a hill of beans. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=326.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's just taking a visa program that we have and upping the monetary threshold [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=328.88s)]
*  necessary to qualify for the visa program. Okay. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=334.96s)]
*  Yeah, and look, so there's out of 500,000 athletes in the NCAAs, only 10 are trans. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=338.0s)]
*  So we all like obsessed with like 10 people out of 330 million people, right? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  And then in this case, my God, 10 people are gonna get the gold card. How obsessed. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=352.8s)]
*  These are squirrels. I'm not saying don't care about issues. I'm not saying don't care about [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=356.64s)]
*  rights. I'm just saying focus, right? What is the actual thing that they wanna do? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=361.44s)]
*  Giant tax cuts and subsidies and contracts to the donor class. Focus. Every time you ring the bell [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=367.36s)]
*  below, an angel gets a swings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80HqSyU-QQg&t=376.24s)]
