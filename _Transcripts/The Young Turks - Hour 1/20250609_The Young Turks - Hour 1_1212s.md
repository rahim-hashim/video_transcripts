TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# What The L.A. Rioters Sadly Don't See Coming
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4)
*  I'm so sick of injustice. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=0.0s)]
*  I just want something to go right. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1.84s)]
*  But- [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=4.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it just feels [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=4.74s)]
*  like until we're able to get [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=7.78s)]
*  stack a couple of electoral wins [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=10.24s)]
*  up here, there's just nothing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=13.18s)]
*  standing in the way of these [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=15.94s)]
*  people except for the courts. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=18.26s)]
*  They had to bring the dude back [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  from El Salvador, which is nice. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=23.88s)]
*  They actually- [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=27.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=28.6s)]
*  I mean, it was weeks later, but [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=29.1s)]
*  they actually listened to the court [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=31.0s)]
*  order. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Now they're going to arrest him and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=33.660000000000004s)]
*  take him to trial, which, shoot, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=35.52s)]
*  I want to see the trial. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=37.52s)]
*  Y'all got criminal facts on this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  guy, present them to the public. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=40.86s)]
*  And that was kind of the whole [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=43.14s)]
*  point. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=44.46s)]
*  And that's why I think what some of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=44.96s)]
*  these people are doing in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=47.6s)]
*  downtown LA is a mistake. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=49.58s)]
*  And I understand the rationale in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=52.06s)]
*  terms of being angry and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=54.6s)]
*  feeling like there's a lawlessness [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=56.580000000000005s)]
*  to what Trump is doing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  And so there's a lawlessness that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  seems to be taking over portions of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=63.42s)]
*  the protest. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=65.86s)]
*  However, bro is back in America [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=67.18s)]
*  from the El Salvadorian Gulag [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=69.88s)]
*  because of public pressure and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=72.6s)]
*  the courts. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=75.2s)]
*  There's just a perception that, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=76.28s)]
*  yo, what you're doing is insane. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  And throwing rocks and burning [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=81.86s)]
*  cars on fire and putting the Mexican [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=84.68s)]
*  flag on it so that people watching [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=87.5s)]
*  this on the internet and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=90.2s)]
*  on the news would be like, yeah, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=91.92s)]
*  Mexico, reckless, crazy, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=94.48s)]
*  send them back. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=96.56s)]
*  I don't know why you would want to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=97.84s)]
*  message that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=99.72s)]
*  But I do think, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=100.64s)]
*  we've talked about this so much, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=101.6s)]
*  you and I specifically, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=103.76s)]
*  winning on messaging, winning on [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=105.64s)]
*  convincing and persuasion seems to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  be lost to a lot of people, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=110.92s)]
*  on the left, they're just above it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=112.94s)]
*  It's like my cause is so righteous, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=115.98s)]
*  I don't have to convince anybody. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=118.42s)]
*  Anybody's not with my cause is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  the devil, which I'm just like, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=122.7s)]
*  guys, that's a freaking mistake. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=127.06s)]
*  And so- [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=128.1s)]
*  If you're involved in any form of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=128.7s)]
*  political activism and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=131.02s)]
*  your response to someone who might [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=132.74s)]
*  not be in the know, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=135.1s)]
*  you have to keep in mind this is [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=136.3s)]
*  a mistake that a lot of people make [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=138.34s)]
*  myself included, Cenk included. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=140.66s)]
*  When he wants to jump in and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=142.9s)]
*  rage against a story that I'm [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  covering, because he's assuming [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=146.62s)]
*  everyone in the audience already [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=148.6s)]
*  knows the facts, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=150.44s)]
*  they know the details. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=151.4s)]
*  No, they don't know necessarily, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  people tune in to get informed and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  then hear our analysis. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=155.6s)]
*  Don't make the mistake of thinking, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=156.88s)]
*  people know what you know. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=159.28s)]
*  So if you are an activist, and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  your go to line in response to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=163.38s)]
*  someone who might not be in the know, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=165.0s)]
*  who might be ignorant of the facts, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=167.12s)]
*  is, I'm so tired, it's not my job [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=169.12s)]
*  to inform you or educate you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=171.26000000000002s)]
*  No, you're going to fucking lose. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=173.3s)]
*  You're going to fucking lose. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=175.82000000000002s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  That's a crazy- [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=177.06s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=177.58s)]
*  That's just the bad. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  And again, I'm not against [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=179.78s)]
*  the protests. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm not against people being angry, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  but I just think burning cars on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=184.78s)]
*  fire and associating that with [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=186.94s)]
*  the people they're trying to kick [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=189.10000000000002s)]
*  out of the country is a mistake. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=191.5s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=194.26000000000002s)]
*  Again, the stuff with the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=196.58s)]
*  Venezuelans and sending people to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=198.34s)]
*  death camps and all of that in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  El Salvador, the coverage, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=202.96s)]
*  the public pressure, the courts [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=205.08s)]
*  being like, bro, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=207.52s)]
*  this is against the law. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=208.82000000000002s)]
*  The administration felt [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=210.68s)]
*  the pressure. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=212.0s)]
*  I was convinced this guy was not [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  coming back. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=214.96s)]
*  Me too, me too. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=215.84s)]
*  And look, our justice system, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=217.36s)]
*  sometimes they get things wrong, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  of course. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=222.08s)]
*  And sometimes it takes a while for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=222.96s)]
*  them to do the right thing or for [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  things to play out in the judicial [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=227.24s)]
*  branch and finally get justice [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=229.98s)]
*  when an injustice has occurred. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=232.22s)]
*  But that's far more effective than [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  throwing cinderbox at the heads of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=238.45999999999998s)]

*  three years. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=445.46000000000004s)]
*  But at the time, I was too afraid [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=447.06s)]
*  to deal with the backlash. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=448.94s)]

*  it is what it is. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=478.6s)]
*  But I have to respect the audience [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=479.88000000000005s)]
*  enough to give them accurate [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=481.16s)]
*  information. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=482.20000000000005s)]
*  So if riots are happening, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=482.72s)]
*  I'm not going to provide cover for [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=484.20000000000005s)]
*  them and say, no, no, no, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=485.96000000000004s)]
*  mostly peaceful protests. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=487.22s)]
*  What we're seeing on the streets of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=489.02s)]
*  LA right now, especially last night, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=491.06s)]
*  and it's escalating, not peaceful. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=493.5s)]
*  Okay, it's just abundantly clear. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=496.98s)]
*  It's not taking hold of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=499.74s)]
*  the entire city, okay? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=500.98s)]
*  Rioters haven't taken control of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=503.46s)]
*  everything, it is limited. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=505.26s)]
*  It's nowhere close to the types of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=506.98s)]
*  riots we saw in the summer of 2020. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=508.54s)]
*  But I am worried about it [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=510.62s)]
*  escalating. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=511.74s)]
*  And Waz, you made a really good [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=513.06s)]
*  point. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=514.58s)]
*  It's unlikely to escalate to the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=515.26s)]
*  point that the riots escalated in [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=517.02s)]
*  2020 because people aren't jobless. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=518.92s)]
*  I mean, it was in the middle of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=523.9599999999999s)]
*  the pandemic when there were [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=525.28s)]
*  shutdowns and people were at home [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=526.52s)]
*  and bored. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=527.9599999999999s)]
*  So hopefully things won't escalate [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=528.48s)]
*  to that extent this time around, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=530.66s)]
*  but I don't know, I am worried and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=532.68s)]
*  it is spreading to other- [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=534.8s)]

*  Yeah, good point. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=560.18s)]
*  It's just not the, the conditions [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=561.54s)]

*  Show me the need. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=607.78s)]
*  At first, it was all the criminals. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=608.78s)]
*  Remember, you were getting out [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=610.26s)]
*  the worst of the worst, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=612.34s)]
*  with drug dealers and rapists and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=613.78s)]
*  killers and all of that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=616.02s)]
*  Before that was your thing, and [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=617.9s)]
*  this was an imperative, and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=619.8199999999999s)]
*  you could go out and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=621.5799999999999s)]
*  sell that vision to the public. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=622.62s)]
*  I'm not sure the public is going to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=624.46s)]

*  squeeze on this deportation effort. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=628.78s)]
*  This seems like a lot. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=631.74s)]
*  And for what? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=633.92s)]
*  Yeah, and look, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=636.12s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=637.16s)]
*  has been releasing the identities [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=639.12s)]
*  of some of the people that got [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=640.92s)]
*  arrested in Los Angeles over [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=642.48s)]
*  the weekend. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=643.92s)]
*  Now keep in mind, upward of 50 [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=644.56s)]
*  people were arrested, so dozens. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  They released the identities of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=648.16s)]
*  eight or nine, and they were [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=649.9599999999999s)]
*  convicted of some pretty heinous [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=651.64s)]
*  crimes. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=653.68s)]
*  But that's eight or nine out of 54, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=654.88s)]
*  or I believe the number was 54. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=656.9599999999999s)]
*  Please don't quote me on it, but [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=658.84s)]
*  it's literally dozens of people. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=660.4s)]
*  I'd like to learn more about [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=662.12s)]
*  the others, because that's where we [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=663.8199999999999s)]
*  can figure out whether or [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=665.88s)]
*  not the juice is really worth [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=667.18s)]
*  the squeeze, right? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=668.68s)]
*  So anyway, let's move on. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=669.8199999999999s)]
*  The people they arrested in terms [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=672.06s)]
*  of ICE deportation or protesters [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=674.24s)]
*  who were losing their minds. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=676.3s)]
*  So hundreds of protesters from what [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=678.2199999999999s)]
*  I've read have been detained. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=680.26s)]
*  I don't know if they're still [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=682.2199999999999s)]
*  detained, but of the individuals [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=683.6999999999999s)]
*  who were arrested- [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=685.54s)]
*  Slated for deportation, gotcha. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=686.54s)]
*  Yeah, dozens of people. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=688.14s)]
*  So out of those dozens, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=689.54s)]
*  we've learned the identities of [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=690.8199999999999s)]
*  eight or nine. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=692.72s)]
*  And those people were convicted of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=693.96s)]
*  violent crimes, including rape. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=695.96s)]
*  One guy was convicted of murder and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=698.12s)]
*  was currently serving. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=700.24s)]
*  I mean, it's weird- [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=702.0s)]
*  And he was on the streets? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=703.2s)]
*  I don't know, because it said that [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  he was sentenced to 15 years to [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=706.72s)]
*  life, so I don't know if it's, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=708.48s)]
*  look, it's California. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=710.24s)]
*  So he might have gone to prison, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=711.4000000000001s)]
*  gotten good behavior credits and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=713.6s)]

*  in California, literally. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=718.2s)]
*  But they're releasing their [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=720.12s)]
*  identities, their photos. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=721.9399999999999s)]
*  Those folks, I don't really, yeah, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=724.42s)]
*  go ahead, deport them. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=726.06s)]
*  I don't give a crap about that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=727.06s)]
*  Yeah, nobody's ever been opposed to [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=728.2199999999999s)]

*  who was convicted for [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1104.3999999999999s)]
*  being involved in a murder of a guy [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1105.86s)]
*  when he was 21 years old. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1108.0s)]
*  He's done 53 years. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1110.0s)]
*  I'm like, look, man, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1111.8799999999999s)]
*  if he was a getaway driver on [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1113.08s)]
*  a murder, 53 years might be enough. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1114.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know, he's 75 now. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1117.12s)]
*  I'm willing to go there. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1120.32s)]
*  Now where I'm not willing to go is [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1122.18s)]
*  prison abolition and shit. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1124.54s)]
*  It's like, yo, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1126.74s)]
*  why do y'all gotta take it? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1127.78s)]
*  Y'all just take it too far. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1129.5s)]
*  But yeah, we shouldn't be putting [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1132.58s)]
*  people in jail. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1134.94s)]
*  A dude got convicted for weed or [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1136.1s)]
*  coke or whatever, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1138.58s)]
*  ecstasy when he was 19. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1140.06s)]
*  Come on, man, he ain't gotta do 35 [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1142.3s)]
*  years behind that. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1144.18s)]
*  Yeah, okay, so [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1145.46s)]
*  here's my take on murder. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1146.34s)]
*  You robbed someone of their life, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1148.1s)]
*  your life should be robbed. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1150.32s)]
*  Not through an execution, but [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1152.0s)]
*  through spending the rest of your [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1153.36s)]
*  life in prison without the [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1154.86s)]
*  possibility of parole. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1156.0s)]
*  I'm not interested in having [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1157.08s)]
*  a discussion about it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1158.2s)]
*  If there's evidence that it was [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1159.56s)]
*  done in self-defense, obviously, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1161.08s)]
*  we're having a different [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1162.72s)]
*  conversation. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1163.76s)]
*  What about driving a getaway car? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1164.36s)]
*  I don't know if I would agree with [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1169.0s)]
*  life in prison without [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1170.76s)]
*  the possibility of parole. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1171.9199999999998s)]
*  I think there's an opportunity for [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1173.48s)]
*  redemption. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1175.0s)]
*  But if you carried out the act of [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1175.52s)]
*  robbing someone of their life, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1177.24s)]
*  you deserve to have your life [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1178.98s)]
*  taken from you. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1180.38s)]
*  And again, I don't mean the death [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1181.3s)]
*  penalty, I mean prison for [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1182.78s)]
*  the rest of your life. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1184.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's my take. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1185.1000000000001s)]
*  Like murder is the worst thing you [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1186.3s)]
*  could possibly do. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1188.02s)]
*  You're literally robbing someone of [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1189.02s)]
*  the most important thing, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1191.14s)]
*  their life, okay, their life. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1192.6200000000001s)]
*  So this person can be rehabilitated, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1194.5s)]
*  I'm not interested, I don't care. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1196.92s)]
*  I don't care if they can be [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1199.3s)]
*  rehabilitated. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1200.66s)]
*  They did the worst possible thing [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1201.6200000000001s)]
*  they can do, they should be in [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1203.1000000000001s)]
*  prison forever. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1204.38s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1205.1000000000001s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1206.82s)]
*  Totally not true, but [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1208.44s)]
*  it does keep you updated on [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1209.48s)]
*  our live shows. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbE44hYPJN4&t=1210.68s)]
