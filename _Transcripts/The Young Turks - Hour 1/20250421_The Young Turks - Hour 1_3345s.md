**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU)

*  We're back. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=50.36s)]
*  At least for a day. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to New York and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  DC the next couple of days. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=54.3s)]
*  But I'm going to do the show from [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=55.84s)]
*  New York tomorrow and we have [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=57.36s)]
*  an amazing, fascinating, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=58.92s)]
*  interesting announcement that is [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=60.56s)]
*  coming later in the week. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=62.64s)]
*  Get ready, get pumped. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=64.48s)]
*  Are we going to change America? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=65.72s)]
*  Of course, of course we are. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=68.36s)]
*  But we'll get to that a little bit [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=71.36s)]
*  later in the week. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=73.0s)]
*  Okay, for today, is Pete Hegseth in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  a little bit of trouble? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  It appears he is. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=77.68s)]
*  Is Donald Trump going to make [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  babies go boom? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=82.0s)]
*  My God. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what he says. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=84.36s)]
*  So how, why? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=85.72s)]
*  I mean, he's making babies go boom [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza right now as we speak. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=89.0s)]
*  Whoa, true, true, true. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=90.68s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  that's a different thing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=92.72s)]
*  And I covered it over the weekend [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  as to what's going on there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=95.48s)]
*  The stock market in more freefall [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=97.84s)]
*  because of more Trump's actions, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=99.68s)]
*  but lots to get to. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=101.48s)]
*  So you know what? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=102.76s)]
*  Why don't we do the show? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  Let's do the show. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=105.12s)]
*  Casper. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=105.92s)]
*  I actually want to start off with [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=107.04s)]
*  this massive Pete Hegseth story. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=108.84s)]
*  Of course, he's the head of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=111.76s)]
*  the Defense Department. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  And it appears that there's quite [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  a bit of infighting, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=116.12s)]
*  quite a bit of chaos. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  And I want to give you all [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=118.56s)]
*  the details, so let's get to it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=119.4s)]
*  A few leakers get fired and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  suddenly a bunch of hit [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=123.36s)]
*  pieces come out. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=124.32s)]
*  Ask the hoodies how much [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=125.36s)]
*  dysfunction there is on. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=127.0s)]
*  Pete's doing a great job. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  Everybody's happy with him. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  We have the highest recruitment [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=132.56s)]
*  numbers I think they've had in 28 [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=134.48s)]
*  years. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=136.44s)]
*  No, he's doing a great job. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  It's just fake news. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=139.64s)]
*  They just bring up stories. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=140.6s)]
*  I guess it sounds like this front [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=141.76s)]
*  told employees. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=143.56s)]
*  He was put there to get rid of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=144.6s)]
*  a lot of bad people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=146.28s)]
*  But is Defense Secretary Pete [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=149.28s)]
*  Hegseth getting rid of a lot of bad [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=151.48s)]
*  people or is he just getting rid of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=153.48s)]
*  Defense Department officials who [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=155.6s)]
*  don't agree with attacking Iran on [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=157.72s)]
*  behalf of Israel? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=159.84s)]
*  That's the real question here. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=160.84s)]
*  And we're going to get to those [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=162.2s)]
*  details in just a minute. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=163.2s)]
*  Regardless, President Trump has [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=164.0s)]
*  decided to publicly defend [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Secretary of State Pete Hegseth. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=167.84s)]
*  Even as absolute chaos is playing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=170.36s)]
*  out within the Pentagon. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=172.6s)]
*  But NPR Cenk is reporting that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=174.4s)]
*  there are some rumors within [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=176.24s)]
*  the White House that they're [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=178.16s)]
*  looking for replacement for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=180.44s)]
*  Pete Hegseth. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=181.88s)]
*  And we're going to get to the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  details on that in just a minute. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=183.56s)]
*  But what do you think about those [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=184.76s)]
*  rumors? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=185.76s)]
*  So the rumors are almost certainly [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  right because now a lot of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=188.44s)]
*  right wingers are confirming them [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=189.92s)]
*  and we'll get to that in a little [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  bit. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  But to me the most interesting [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=193.6s)]
*  thing is what you just said, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=195.28s)]
*  Casper, why? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=196.76s)]
*  because there are two [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  possibilities one Hegseth is just [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=199.12s)]
*  a disaster and we've got all sorts [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=201.04s)]
*  of issues personal issues with [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  Hegseth that's leading to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  the disaster or there's this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=206.88s)]
*  giant fight within the pro-Israel [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=209.28s)]
*  and anti-Israel camps. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=211.72s)]
*  There is no anti-Israel camp but [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=214.08s)]
*  hey let's not do everything [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  Israel ass camp, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=217.0s)]
*  Within the administration within [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=218.84s)]
*  the Defense Department. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=220.36s)]
*  Is that what the real issue is? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=221.44s)]
*  Let's try to find out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=224.32s)]
*  So I did some deep research into [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=225.72s)]
*  this story because I was really [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=227.12s)]
*  curious about that very question [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=228.36s)]
*  and I've got some receipts. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=230.12s)]
*  So let's get to it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=232.12s)]
*  Now, part of what has really blown [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=233.56s)]
*  up in regard to criticism towards [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  the fact that a Trump loyalist and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  a former Pentagon official [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=243.88s)]
*  spokesperson for the Pentagon who [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=245.88s)]
*  advocated for Pete Hegseth to be [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  confirmed as Defense Secretary has [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  now essentially put out this long [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=253.04s)]
*  piece in Politico to talk about [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  the chaos that has been unfolding [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=257.76s)]
*  within the Defense Department. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=260.08s)]
*  So this is John Uliot who is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=262.36s)]
*  the former chief Pentagon [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  spokesperson. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=265.96s)]
*  He was in fact offered a new role [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=267.56s)]
*  within the Pentagon. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=269.68s)]
*  He claimed that it was a generous [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=271.4s)]
*  offer by Hegseth himself, but [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  he decided that he would not take [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=275.04s)]
*  that role. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=276.8s)]
*  Nonetheless, he writes that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=277.92s)]
*  President Donald Trump has a strong [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=279.32s)]
*  record of holding his top [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=281.24s)]
*  officials to account. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=282.4s)]
*  Given that it's hard to see [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=284.16s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=285.66s)]
*  remaining in his role for [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=287.4s)]
*  much longer. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=288.64s)]
*  So the fact that he wrote this [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  opinion piece again is very [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=291.2s)]
*  relevant considering the fact that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=292.56s)]
*  he is not some Trump [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=294.44s)]
*  administration hater. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=295.4s)]
*  He's very much supportive of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=297.0s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=298.16s)]
*  He was supportive of Hegseth, but [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=299.04s)]
*  notice that there was a lack of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=301.16s)]
*  real leadership in the Pentagon as [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=303.08s)]
*  a result of Hegseth serving as [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=305.08s)]
*  Secretary of Defense. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=306.8s)]
*  Go ahead, Cenk. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=308.08s)]
*  Yeah, one quick thing about this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=310.0s)]
*  guy so you know he's legit. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=311.4s)]
*  Only in this regard, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=312.8s)]
*  not for anything else, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=314.16s)]
*  is that he's the guy who was trying [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=315.76s)]
*  to root out DEI from the Pentagon. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=318.1s)]
*  He's the guy that was want to take [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=320.92s)]
*  reference to Jackie Robinson off of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=323.44s)]
*  Defense Department materials etc. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=326.72s)]
*  So my point there isn't that he's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=329.12s)]
*  a good guy, my point is that he's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=330.8s)]
*  die hard conservative. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=332.46000000000004s)]
*  So this is not some sort of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=333.8s)]
*  Lib attack on Hegseth at all. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  In fact, you can go to town hall [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=337.52s)]
*  where he published an opinion piece [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=339.76s)]
*  advocating for the confirmation of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  Pete Hegseth to serve as [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  Defense Secretary. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=346.56s)]
*  The title is Pete Hegseth is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=348.16s)]
*  the best choice to reform [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=349.68s)]
*  the Pentagon, okay? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=351.0s)]
*  So I'm sure he's regretting that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=352.68s)]
*  now to some extent. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=354.56s)]
*  But let's get to some of the other [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=355.96s)]
*  details that we know of at this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=357.68s)]
*  moment. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=359.28s)]
*  So he writes in this Politico op-ed [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  that yet even strong backers of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=362.35999999999996s)]
*  the secretary like me must admit, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=364.53999999999996s)]
*  the last month has been a full [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=366.88s)]
*  blown meltdown at the Pentagon and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  it's becoming a real problem for [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  the administration. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  Now he calls out the Defense [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=374.76s)]
*  Department's firings that took [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=376.24s)]
*  place just last Friday. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  And among them were Pete Hegseth's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=379.28s)]
*  most loyal senior staffers, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=381.67999999999995s)]
*  including senior advisor Dan [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=383.67999999999995s)]
*  Caldwell. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=385.8s)]
*  And then you also had Deputy Chief [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=386.92s)]
*  of Staff Darren Selnick and [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  finally Colin Carroll who's the or [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=390.6s)]
*  was the Chief of Staff to the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  Deputy Secretary of Defense. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  Now in regard to those firings, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  Yuliyot writes that in the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=398.56s)]
*  aftermath, Defense Department [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  officials working for Hegseth tried [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=401.92s)]
*  to smear the aides anonymously to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=403.88000000000005s)]
*  reporters claiming they were fired [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=405.76000000000005s)]
*  for leaking sensitive information [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=407.72s)]
*  as part of an investigation ordered [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=409.70000000000005s)]
*  earlier this month. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=411.72s)]
*  Yet none of this is true. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  He writes. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=415.68s)]
*  So what does he mean by that? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=417.08s)]
*  Well, apparently, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=418.56s)]
*  the Defense Department had said [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=419.96s)]
*  that it would conduct polygraph [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=422.12s)]
*  tests to determine who within [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=424.2s)]
*  the department was lying about [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=426.12s)]
*  leaking information to reporters. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=428.18s)]
*  Now at least one of the individuals [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=431.68s)]
*  who got fired has said that, look, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=434.18s)]
*  none of us have had any polygraph [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=436.68s)]
*  tests. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=438.88s)]
*  And the other thing that they've [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=440.2s)]
*  said is that one of them was told [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=442.44s)]
*  by former colleagues at the Defense [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  Department that they were cleared [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=446.52000000000004s)]
*  of any wrongdoing and they don't [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  have to worry about getting fired [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  and then they ended up getting [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=451.88s)]
*  fired. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  So the cover story is that they got [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=453.78000000000003s)]
*  fired for leaking when that's not [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=455.68s)]
*  really the case. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=457.6s)]
*  So why did they get fired? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=458.48s)]
*  So then on Friday, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=460.44s)]
*  Politico reported that Hegseth's [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=461.32s)]
*  Chief of Staff, Joe Casper, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=463.08000000000004s)]
*  was also stepping down from his [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=464.48s)]
*  role, which is odd considering [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=465.92s)]
*  Casper is the one who called for [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=467.48s)]
*  the investigations into the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=469.12s)]
*  department to determine who within [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  the department is leaking [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  information to reporters. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  And he was also the one who was [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  advocating for a pause on [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=478.68s)]
*  intelligence gathering on behalf [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=480.18s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=482.32s)]
*  So Joe Casper apparently didn't [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=484.04s)]
*  like those guys, said one defense [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=486.22s)]
*  official, they all have different [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=488.42s)]
*  styles, they just didn't get along, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=490.68s)]
*  it was a personality clash. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=493.0s)]
*  So right now as we speak, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=495.36s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, the head of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=496.68s)]
*  the Defense Department, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  is presiding over a department [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=499.40000000000003s)]
*  where his two closest advisors for [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=501.12s)]
*  over a decade are no longer there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=503.2s)]
*  And he's without Chiefs of Staff [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=505.52s)]
*  for himself and for his deputy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=507.6s)]
*  So why did they get fired, Cenk? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=511.04s)]
*  And it turns out there's infighting [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=512.48s)]
*  over the topic of going to war with [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=514.6s)]
*  Iran on behalf of Israel. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=516.54s)]
*  You have the so [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=519.28s)]
*  called interventionists, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=520.04s)]
*  the neoconservatives who very much [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=521.72s)]
*  want to carry out what's in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=523.52s)]
*  the best interest of Israel as [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=524.72s)]
*  opposed to the United States. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=526.2s)]
*  And then you have the America First [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=528.0s)]
*  crowd who appears to be pushed out [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=530.0s)]
*  of the Defense Department. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=532.4s)]
*  I'll give you some specific [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=533.76s)]
*  examples as to why, go ahead. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=535.12s)]
*  Yeah, so here's what we know and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=536.92s)]
*  what we don't know. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=538.36s)]
*  So we know for sure that there's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=539.16s)]
*  a giant blow up at the Pentagon, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=542.76s)]
*  So those is super weird for him to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=543.28s)]
*  fire die hard conservatives and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=545.9599999999999s)]
*  his allies for the last decade, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=548.5999999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=551.12s)]
*  So that doesn't make any sense at [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=551.76s)]
*  all. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=553.8s)]
*  So there's a mystery there for [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=554.36s)]
*  sure. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=556.0s)]
*  Okay, then number two is we know [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  that the official cover story is not [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=558.48s)]
*  anywhere near true. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=560.28s)]
*  And the guys that they were fired [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=561.64s)]
*  and then had the leaks against them [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=563.04s)]
*  and so they're like, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  not only what all the things that [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=565.36s)]
*  Anna said, they're like, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=566.96s)]
*  we were looking forward to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=568.36s)]
*  the lie detector test and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=569.72s)]
*  then they never gave us one. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=570.96s)]
*  And then pretended that it was [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=572.8s)]
*  by the so the official story is [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=573.76s)]
*  definitely garbage, right? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=574.96s)]
*  So that leads us to trying to [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=576.56s)]
*  figure out, so [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=578.36s)]
*  why are they actually doing this? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=579.4s)]
*  That's the big mystery. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=581.48s)]
*  So now, and by the way, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=582.64s)]
*  as you heard me talk about it on [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=584.1999999999999s)]
*  the show earlier when Laura Loomer [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=586.24s)]
*  went in and said we're going to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=588.76s)]
*  oust, I found a list of the neocons [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=591.0200000000001s)]
*  and we're going to oust them. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=593.3000000000001s)]
*  I thought that is super strange. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=595.3000000000001s)]
*  She's massively pro Israel. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=597.7s)]
*  And she's against the neocons? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=599.5400000000001s)]
*  That story doesn't make any sense. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=603.7s)]
*  And now I totally believe that [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=604.34s)]
*  that was a total lie. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=606.62s)]
*  That she had done an investigation [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=608.58s)]
*  and she wanted to root out anyone [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=610.6600000000001s)]
*  within the executive branch that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=612.6600000000001s)]
*  wasn't serving the America First [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=614.82s)]
*  Agenda. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=616.98s)]
*  Because the America First Agenda [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=617.7800000000001s)]
*  runs up against, it is counter to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=620.42s)]
*  US foreign policy in Israel. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=622.6999999999999s)]
*  And Laura Loomer loves US foreign [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=625.46s)]
*  policy in regard to Israel. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=627.06s)]
*  So I just find it hard to believe [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=628.46s)]
*  that she worked to oust individuals [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=630.66s)]
*  who are neocons when her foreign [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=633.14s)]
*  policy preferences happen to align [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=635.38s)]
*  with neocons. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=637.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so there's something fishy [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=639.62s)]
*  about that story. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=640.86s)]
*  So what did you find, Ana? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=641.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk about this [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=643.42s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=644.38s)]
*  So it's worth mentioning that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=644.9s)]
*  the America First crowd that [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=646.46s)]
*  prioritizes the United States over [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=647.9399999999999s)]
*  Israel consists of the very people [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=649.82s)]
*  who are getting fired under these [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=651.82s)]
*  dubious claims of leaking, right? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=653.74s)]
*  So Caldwell, for instance, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=655.94s)]
*  supports a more realist and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=658.0600000000001s)]
*  restraint oriented national security [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=660.1800000000001s)]
*  policy, particularly in regard to [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=663.34s)]
*  Iran and also in regard to Ukraine. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=666.22s)]
*  But for our purposes here, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=669.6600000000001s)]
*  we're going to focus on US foreign [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=671.22s)]
*  policy that suits the best interests [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=673.1400000000001s)]
*  of Israel as opposed to the United [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=675.3800000000001s)]
*  States. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=677.34s)]
*  And it's also been reported that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=677.9000000000001s)]
*  there's been clash among Trump's [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=679.54s)]
*  inner circle over whether or [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=681.3s)]
*  not the United States should go to [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=682.78s)]
*  war with Iran or attack Iran on [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=684.5799999999999s)]
*  behalf of Israel. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=686.38s)]
*  Also, this was reported by [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=687.5799999999999s)]
*  responsible statecraft, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=689.38s)]
*  that's the publication that's [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=691.18s)]
*  aligned with the Quincy Institute. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=693.2199999999999s)]
*  Daniel Davis said he lost [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=695.5799999999999s)]
*  an opportunity to work for [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=697.06s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=698.62s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard after Jewish Insider [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=700.8199999999999s)]
*  Magazine and other neoconservative [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=702.9s)]
*  voices called him out for his [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=705.26s)]
*  opposition to the war in Gaza and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=707.06s)]
*  meetings about military conflict [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=709.3s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=711.38s)]
*  And there's some more reporting [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=712.8199999999999s)]
*  about this. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=714.3s)]
*  For instance, we know and [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=714.86s)]
*  we've been knowing about how [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=716.22s)]
*  the Israel lobby has been trying to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=717.8199999999999s)]
*  oust Steve Witkoff from Trump's [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=719.66s)]
*  administration. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=721.5s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, of course, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=722.74s)]
*  was the individual who pressured [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=724.1s)]
*  Israel to sign a temporary cease [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=725.86s)]
*  fire deal with Hamas that kind of [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=727.66s)]
*  fell apart in the end. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=729.42s)]
*  But there was a temporary halt in [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=730.9s)]
*  the fighting, but [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=732.86s)]
*  Israel didn't like that. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=733.86s)]
*  They didn't like that pressure and [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=735.38s)]
*  ever since then they've been trying [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=737.06s)]
*  to oust Steve Witkoff from [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=738.74s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=740.12s)]
*  Also, here's a post from Sager and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=741.58s)]
*  Jette, which I think is relevant [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=743.5s)]
*  here, new for me and Ryan Grimm. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=745.34s)]
*  Mike Waltz put a former Israeli [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=747.14s)]
*  Ministry of Defense employee on [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=749.38s)]
*  the Israel and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=751.62s)]
*  Iran portfolio in the National [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=752.7s)]
*  Security Council. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=754.78s)]
*  NSC confirmed her employment and [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=756.1800000000001s)]
*  describes her as a patriotic [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=758.42s)]
*  American. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=760.3s)]
*  No, she's literally an Israeli. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=761.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, she might be an Israeli [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=763.38s)]
*  American, but she was on the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=765.22s)]
*  Ministry of Defense of another [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=767.3s)]
*  country. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=769.18s)]
*  I don't care which country, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=770.18s)]
*  like the Saudis, the Norwegians, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=771.9399999999999s)]
*  no, no, you served already in [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  a Defense Department. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=775.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=777.02s)]
*  And it wasn't ours. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=777.54s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=779.2199999999999s)]
*  That's insane on so many levels. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=780.5s)]
*  So a quick clarification because [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=782.18s)]
*  it is relevant to Pete Hegsitz role [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=784.38s)]
*  in all of this, right? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=786.7199999999999s)]
*  The NSC is not within the Pentagon. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=788.3399999999999s)]
*  NSC is a completely different [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=791.3s)]
*  federal government, right? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=793.3199999999999s)]
*  So, it's a completely different [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=795.26s)]
*  government, right? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=797.5999999999999s)]

*  government, right? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=800.8599999999999s)]
*  And so, what does that mean? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=802.3s)]
*  It's a completely different [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=804.18s)]
*  government, right? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=805.7399999999999s)]

*  Yeah, so thank you for [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=822.0600000000001s)]
*  the clarification on the defense. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=823.1800000000001s)]

*  Ministry of another country and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=839.46s)]
*  then come and serve in a super [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=840.9200000000001s)]
*  important national security role [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=842.34s)]
*  in our country. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=844.1800000000001s)]
*  So, calling into the dual loyalties [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=845.9000000000001s)]
*  of Jewish Americans or [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=848.46s)]
*  Turkish Americans or [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=850.22s)]
*  any other Americans is unacceptable. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=851.88s)]
*  But this is not just a normal [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=855.94s)]
*  citizen, this is someone who worked [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=857.62s)]
*  for their Defense Department. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=859.94s)]
*  Do you think she's going to be [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=861.94s)]
*  unbiased when it comes to Israel? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=863.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, come on, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=866.3000000000001s)]
*  don't be ridiculous, that's insane. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=867.02s)]
*  We'd never allow it for [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=869.46s)]
*  any other country. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=870.38s)]
*  So look, I don't know if Pete [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=871.42s)]
*  Hegseth was behind ousting his top [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=874.26s)]
*  advisors, right? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=877.74s)]
*  People who he has close relations [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=879.74s)]
*  with or relationships with for [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=882.42s)]
*  over a decade. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=884.82s)]
*  I don't know what's really going on [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=886.74s)]
*  or who's making the decisions to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=888.22s)]
*  purge individuals within the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=889.62s)]
*  Defense Department in particular. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=890.92s)]
*  But to me, it's becoming more and [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=893.1s)]
*  more clear that the pro-Israel side [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=895.22s)]
*  is winning this war and basically [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=897.46s)]
*  succeeding in pushing out the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=899.58s)]
*  individuals who are like, yeah, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=901.46s)]
*  maybe we don't go to war with Iran [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=903.5s)]
*  on behalf of a foreign country. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=905.46s)]
*  That's not going to be in the best [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=907.3000000000001s)]
*  interest of the American people or [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=908.7s)]
*  our military. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=910.0600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=911.26s)]
*  speaking of Mike Waltz, remember, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=912.02s)]
*  Mike Waltz was the guy who included [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=914.14s)]
*  Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=916.3000000000001s)]
*  in that Signal Chat that got [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=918.74s)]
*  Hegseth into a lot of hot water. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=920.48s)]
*  Interesting how he hasn't been [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=922.7s)]
*  fired, right? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=924.6600000000001s)]
*  But he is also the guy who has put [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=925.98s)]
*  that former Israeli Ministry of [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=928.14s)]
*  Defense employee in the NSC. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=930.34s)]
*  Yeah, so look, there's things we [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=932.62s)]
*  know and don't know, right? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=934.26s)]
*  So Mike Waltz is neocon totally in [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=935.5s)]
*  favor of Israel. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=937.82s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=940.58s)]
*  And in the beginning of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=942.1s)]
*  the administration, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=943.02s)]
*  we told you that Mary Madeleine, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=943.86s)]
*  one of his top donors, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=945.3s)]
*  basically asked for a number of [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=946.34s)]
*  neocons to go in the administration, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=947.78s)]
*  including Marco Rubio, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=949.54s)]
*  Secretary of State, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=950.66s)]
*  Mike Waltz, the National Security [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=951.7s)]
*  Council, Huckabee, and [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=953.38s)]
*  then Slotnik. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=954.58s)]
*  Slotnik, they ran into some [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=955.62s)]
*  problems because they didn't want [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=957.24s)]
*  to lose that house seat, right? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=959.3000000000001s)]
*  And then Pete Hegseth we had as, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=961.34s)]
*  historically has been very pro [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=963.46s)]
*  Israel, more militaristic, etc., but [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=965.62s)]
*  was not as clear as the others, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=968.26s)]
*  right? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=970.3000000000001s)]
*  So now, to give you a sense again, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=971.0600000000001s)]
*  this is not about dual loyalties or [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=972.5400000000001s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=973.98s)]
*  Steve Woodcoff is also Jewish [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=974.7800000000001s)]
*  American, but Israel's apparently [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=976.22s)]
*  trying to oust him because he's not [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=978.26s)]
*  sufficiently loyal enough to [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=980.3000000000001s)]
*  Israel, which bless his heart. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=981.98s)]
*  I mean, you're supposed to be [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=983.82s)]
*  representing us, and he is. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=985.4200000000001s)]
*  So don't ever take it out on our [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=987.22s)]
*  Jewish American brothers and [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=988.62s)]
*  sisters, right? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=989.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't even say that he's [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=990.58s)]
*  not sufficiently loyal to Israel. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=992.34s)]
*  He just wanted to broker a ceasefire [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=993.82s)]
*  deal, and Israel didn't like that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=996.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=998.7800000000001s)]
*  you're absolutely right. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=999.74s)]
*  I can make an argument for [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1000.9000000000001s)]
*  that is much better for Israel. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1002.46s)]
*  100%, yeah. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1004.5400000000001s)]
*  But he's not sufficiently loyal to [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1005.3000000000001s)]
*  the lunatics currently running [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1007.1s)]
*  the Israeli government. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1008.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1009.98s)]
*  Right, and so I'm going to add one [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1010.62s)]
*  more piece of data to this, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1012.66s)]
*  which is that the other day, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1014.54s)]
*  Mark Levin got appointed to [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1016.62s)]
*  a government post. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1018.64s)]
*  And I was like, Mark Levin? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1020.22s)]
*  Mark Levin is the most Israel first [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1022.78s)]
*  guy in all of American media. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1025.34s)]
*  He makes Ben Shapiro look like he's [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1028.26s)]
*  part of the Gaza resistance. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1030.3s)]
*  And so, and he was furious that we [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1032.34s)]
*  didn't attack Iran, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1034.18s)]
*  furious whenever we don't do [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1035.38s)]
*  anything that Israel commands. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1037.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1038.9s)]
*  And he got appointed to a homeland [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1039.4s)]
*  security advisory council. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1041.46s)]
*  So there's movement here, guys. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1044.42s)]
*  So there, and remember, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1046.42s)]
*  just last week, reporters have [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1048.02s)]
*  really piece of good news, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1050.02s)]
*  which huge piece of good news, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1051.7s)]
*  which is that Trump refused [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1053.66s)]
*  Netanyahu's request to bomb Iran. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1055.46s)]
*  For now. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1058.0600000000002s)]
*  Right, for now. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1058.5600000000002s)]
*  And so, and now that things are not [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1059.7s)]
*  going in the direction that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1061.94s)]
*  Netanyahu wants, all of a sudden, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1063.66s)]
*  chairs are getting moved around in [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1066.02s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1068.3000000000002s)]
*  And people that are more likely to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1070.18s)]
*  say, yeah, we should definitely [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1071.9s)]
*  attack Iran are being brought into [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1073.48s)]
*  the room. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1075.0600000000002s)]
*  And the people who are saying, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1075.8600000000001s)]
*  hey, maybe we should serve America [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1077.02s)]
*  first, are being moved out of [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1078.3400000000001s)]
*  the room. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1079.6200000000001s)]
*  So I want to just go back to this [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1080.78s)]
*  piece that was written by Ulyot, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1082.7s)]
*  because he also mentions all of [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1084.98s)]
*  the other foibles that have gone on [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1087.0600000000002s)]
*  in the Defense Department under [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1089.54s)]
*  Hegseth leadership. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1091.7s)]
*  Obviously, there's Signal Gate, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1093.1000000000001s)]
*  where they're communicating. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1095.38s)]
*  Okay, administration officials are [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1097.42s)]
*  communicating about an impending [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1099.54s)]
*  strike on the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1101.58s)]
*  But now it turns out, according to [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1103.74s)]
*  a new New York Times piece, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1106.3799999999999s)]
*  Hegseth also shared sensitive [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1108.52s)]
*  details about military operations [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1110.96s)]
*  in Yemen in another Signal Chat [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1113.78s)]
*  that included family members, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1116.34s)]
*  namely his wife, and [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1118.94s)]
*  I believe his brother as well. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1120.6s)]
*  So, and his lawyer, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1122.74s)]
*  what are you doing? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1124.34s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1125.8999999999999s)]
*  So that news also led to this fury [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1127.54s)]
*  within the Trump administration [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1129.74s)]
*  about the leaks that have been [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1131.86s)]
*  going on, because that report [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1133.6599999999999s)]
*  doesn't happen unless someone [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1135.44s)]
*  leaked it to the New York Times. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1137.2s)]
*  But nonetheless, the leaks, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1139.22s)]
*  I think, are less of an issue. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1140.6399999999999s)]
*  What's a bigger issue here is that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1141.98s)]
*  you have all this influence from [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1144.46s)]
*  a foreign government leading to [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1146.94s)]
*  personnel decisions within our very [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1149.44s)]
*  own Defense Department, and [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1152.1399999999999s)]
*  that's unacceptable. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1154.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, I mean, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1156.62s)]
*  the reporting on this has been [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1158.3999999999999s)]
*  really miserable, because they're [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1160.02s)]
*  talking about, there is a massive [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1162.1399999999999s)]
*  upheaval in the Defense Department. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1164.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but why? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1167.4199999999998s)]
*  But literally no article talks [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1168.6599999999999s)]
*  about why, which, by the way, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1170.3799999999999s)]
*  is honestly another sign that it's [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1172.04s)]
*  Israel, because the one thing [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1173.8799999999999s)]
*  you're not allowed to talk about in [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1175.4199999999998s)]
*  mainstream media is Israel, or [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1177.1399999999999s)]
*  money and politics. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1178.9399999999998s)]
*  Those are two issues you're never [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1180.3s)]
*  allowed to discuss, right? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1181.62s)]
*  So you're telling me there's [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1182.82s)]
*  a massive upheaval in the Defense [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1184.5s)]
*  Department, and not a single [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1186.46s)]
*  mainstream media reporter that [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1188.18s)]
*  covers the Pentagon and [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1190.0s)]
*  the White House has any idea why? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1191.42s)]
*  No, that doesn't make any sense at [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1194.18s)]
*  all. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1195.66s)]
*  And it gets worse, Hegseth brought [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1196.16s)]
*  his wife, a former Fox News [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1198.5s)]
*  producer, to two separate meetings [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1200.1000000000001s)]
*  with foreign military counterparts [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1202.26s)]
*  where sensitive information was [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1204.42s)]
*  discussed. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1206.5s)]
*  So this is separate from the signal [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1207.26s)]
*  chat, and also the Pentagon, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1209.9s)]
*  as we know, set up a top secret [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1212.18s)]
*  briefing by the Joint Chiefs [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1214.22s)]
*  of Staff on China, specifically for [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1216.52s)]
*  Elon Musk, who has business in [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1218.76s)]
*  China. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1220.6799999999998s)]
*  The White House, though, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1221.6399999999999s)]
*  did call that off after they caught [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1222.9599999999998s)]
*  wind of it. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1224.6799999999998s)]
*  So how is Pete Hegseth handling all [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1225.52s)]
*  of this news? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1227.52s)]
*  Well, he's handling it the way you [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1228.3999999999999s)]
*  would expect him to. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1229.9199999999998s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1230.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, what a big surprise that a [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1232.3999999999999s)]
*  bunch of a few leakers get fired [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1234.2399999999998s)]
*  and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1235.9199999999998s)]
*  come out from the same media that [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1237.84s)]
*  peddled the Russia hoax, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1239.76s)]
*  won't give back their Pulitzers. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1241.2399999999998s)]
*  They got Pulitzers for [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1243.6799999999998s)]
*  a bunch of lies. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1244.6799999999998s)]
*  They got Pulitzers for [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1246.1599999999999s)]
*  a bunch of lies. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1247.28s)]
*  And on hoaxes time and time and [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1248.08s)]
*  time again. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1250.28s)]
*  And as they peddle those lies, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  no one ever calls them on it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1254.04s)]
*  See, this is what the media does. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1255.84s)]
*  They take anonymous sources from [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1258.0s)]
*  disgruntled former employees, and [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1259.9599999999998s)]
*  then they try to slash and [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1262.1599999999999s)]
*  burn people and [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1263.56s)]
*  ruin their reputations. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1264.52s)]
*  Not going to work with me, because [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1265.9199999999998s)]
*  we're changing the Defense [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1267.8s)]
*  Department, putting the Pentagon [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1269.32s)]
*  back in the hands of war fighters, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1271.12s)]
*  and anonymous smears from [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1273.0s)]
*  disgruntled former employees on [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1274.36s)]
*  the road. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1276.08s)]
*  News doesn't matter. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1276.72s)]
*  So before I go to Cenk for [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1279.36s)]
*  comment on the clip that we just [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1280.48s)]
*  watched, now that I've seen this [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1282.0s)]
*  on a bigger screen, it does appear [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1283.56s)]
*  the Pete Hegseth sideburns are even. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1285.36s)]
*  It's just that one of them is more [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1288.0s)]
*  gray than the other, so [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1289.1999999999998s)]
*  it looks shorter than the other. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1289.96s)]
*  Important point to mention, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1291.36s)]
*  it's a big debate on Twitter right [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1292.56s)]
*  now, go ahead Cenk. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1294.04s)]
*  That's funny because I didn't know [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1295.3999999999999s)]
*  it was a big debate on Twitter. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1296.6799999999998s)]
*  And I thought, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1297.6799999999998s)]
*  he's got to police those sideburns. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1298.52s)]
*  They're very long sideburns. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1300.8s)]
*  We're apparently going back [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1302.9199999999998s)]
*  to the 1970s, maybe that's [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1303.8s)]
*  the cause of all this. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1304.6s)]
*  Okay, and it did look like he had [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1305.6399999999999s)]
*  a little bit of Easter egg on [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1307.0s)]
*  his face there. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1308.04s)]
*  So, you're all weak whether you [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1309.6399999999999s)]
*  like it or not. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1311.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay, anyways, super defensive, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1312.56s)]
*  but on the other hand, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1314.6399999999999s)]
*  he's beleaguered, so [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1315.7199999999998s)]
*  I give him a pass on being defensive. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1317.0s)]
*  So look, we continue not to know [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1320.04s)]
*  why, we're not saying here we know [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1322.0s)]
*  for sure that it's Israel that are [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1324.24s)]
*  moving these chairs and stuff. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1326.1999999999998s)]
*  But we know that it's not the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1328.36s)]
*  official reason, and [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1329.8s)]
*  there's that speculation. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1330.8s)]
*  By the way, there's other [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1332.0s)]
*  speculation, there could be other [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1333.32s)]
*  reasons, right? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1335.12s)]
*  So some of our members are [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1336.32s)]
*  speculating whether it's whiskey [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1337.7199999999998s)]
*  leaks, and I don't know that that's [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1339.28s)]
*  fair, and maybe that's the reason [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1341.1599999999999s)]
*  the mainstream media isn't giving [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1342.9599999999998s)]
*  a reason because they heard that, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1344.6399999999999s)]
*  but they don't have enough sources [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1346.32s)]
*  to confirm it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1347.84s)]
*  And you know what I'm saying? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1348.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, can I just, okay, I don't [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1349.6s)]
*  think we should be poking fun at [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1352.0s)]
*  his substance abuse issues, okay? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1354.3999999999999s)]
*  I get that he's a baddie because [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1357.7199999999998s)]
*  he's on the other side of [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1359.2399999999998s)]
*  the political aisle. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1360.3999999999999s)]
*  Let's be kind to people who [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1361.76s)]
*  struggle with substance abuse [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1363.0s)]
*  issues. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1364.3999999999999s)]
*  No, I agree with that in general, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1365.52s)]
*  of course, right? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1367.1599999999999s)]
*  And we're good libs, and [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1368.24s)]
*  we're not going to hold anything [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1369.2s)]
*  against good folks who are [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1370.48s)]
*  struggling with issues. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1371.6s)]
*  But you can't be the defense [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1373.36s)]
*  secretary while you're struggling [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1374.48s)]
*  with that. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1375.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't know if he is at [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1376.3999999999999s)]
*  the moment, and we don't have the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1377.68s)]
*  evidence that he is. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1379.28s)]
*  And it seems like we're just poking [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1380.6399999999999s)]
*  fun at him for [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1382.12s)]
*  having substance abuse issues. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1382.68s)]
*  No, no, since there is no good [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1384.0s)]
*  explanation of what's happening, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1385.52s)]
*  and you know us, we can suss out [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1387.32s)]
*  what's really happening pretty [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1389.0s)]
*  good, right? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1390.6399999999999s)]
*  Like we've had a long history of [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1391.36s)]
*  this, and then, hey, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1393.0s)]
*  that was the actual reason, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1394.24s)]
*  because they hide the real reason. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1395.8s)]
*  That's why we have to dive in and [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1398.3600000000001s)]
*  try to figure out what the real [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1400.0s)]
*  reason is, right? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1401.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the real reason is Israel. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1402.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1404.92s)]
*  Okay, I would bet my money on that. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1405.44s)]
*  I would. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1406.72s)]
*  So that's your theory, and [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1407.24s)]
*  it's a very good theory, right? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1408.2s)]
*  And I'm just stating another [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1409.52s)]
*  theory, not because I have any [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1410.64s)]
*  information in that regard, but [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1411.92s)]
*  just because it's such a giant [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1413.3600000000001s)]
*  mystery as to why all of these [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1414.8s)]
*  things are happening at the same [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1416.32s)]
*  time. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1418.0s)]
*  So I get why the members are [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1418.96s)]
*  speculating about that. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1420.2s)]
*  So let me just reset to briefly [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1421.68s)]
*  talk about the possibility of [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1423.32s)]
*  Hegseth being replaced. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1425.32s)]
*  Because I think that there might [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1427.24s)]
*  be some truth behind that. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1429.44s)]
*  There's more and more pressure for [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1431.36s)]
*  Trump to reconsider Hegseth in [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1433.32s)]
*  that leadership role. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1435.04s)]
*  So let me just give you those [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1436.32s)]
*  details. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1437.6399999999999s)]
*  So earlier today, NPR reported that [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1438.16s)]
*  the White House is looking for [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1440.3999999999999s)]
*  possible replacements for [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1442.24s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1444.02s)]
*  Now the Defense Department under [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1446.52s)]
*  his leadership has kind of been [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1448.08s)]
*  in shambles. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1449.44s)]
*  There's been a lot of scandal, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1449.96s)]
*  a lot of drama, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1451.52s)]
*  infighting because of the differing [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1452.52s)]
*  views on what the US foreign [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1454.76s)]
*  policy should be. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1456.42s)]
*  Now, the reporting from NPR didn't [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1458.0400000000002s)]
*  really get into too many details. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1460.68s)]
*  They basically reported that [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1464.4s)]
*  the White House had begun the [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1466.0600000000002s)]
*  process of looking for [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1467.76s)]
*  a new Secretary of Defense, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1469.02s)]
*  according to a US official who was [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1470.64s)]
*  not authorized to speak publicly. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1472.5600000000002s)]
*  Now following that report, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1474.52s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1475.6200000000001s)]
*  White House press secretary denied [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1476.24s)]
*  it, she called it fake news. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1477.72s)]
*  But then Eric Erickson, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1479.2800000000002s)]
*  who's a conservative radio show [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1480.72s)]
*  host, began to confirm it on [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1482.68s)]
*  Twitter or X responding to other [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1484.46s)]
*  people's comments and stuff like [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1486.46s)]
*  that. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1488.5400000000002s)]
*  He said that people in the White [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1489.0800000000002s)]
*  House are looking at possible [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1490.88s)]
*  Secretary of Defense replacements. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1492.5600000000002s)]
*  Trump is not inclined to replace [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1494.8400000000001s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1496.68s)]
*  People in the White House believe [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1498.48s)]
*  more is coming on Hegseth that will [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1500.72s)]
*  turn Trump toward wanting [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1502.76s)]
*  a replacement. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1504.46s)]
*  Now I want to be clear, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1505.88s)]
*  Eric Erickson is not a fan of [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1506.88s)]
*  Donald Trump's. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1508.16s)]
*  I'm taking what he's saying at face [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1509.4399999999998s)]
*  value because what do you know that [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1511.28s)]
*  we don't know? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1513.04s)]
*  What are your sources? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1514.0s)]
*  Do you have any receipts to show [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1515.4399999999998s)]
*  us? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1516.8799999999999s)]
*  And the fact that he doesn't like [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1517.3799999999999s)]
*  the Trump administration makes me [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  take what he's saying with [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1520.4199999999998s)]
*  a grain of salt at the moment until [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1521.52s)]
*  I actually see some more evidence. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1523.04s)]
*  But I wouldn't be surprised if [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1524.8s)]
*  the Trump administration ultimately [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1526.32s)]
*  replaces Hegseth. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1528.24s)]
*  Yeah, so look, these are the type [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1529.3999999999999s)]
*  of stories where I'm like, well, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1531.08s)]
*  we'll find out, right? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1532.6s)]
*  Because the right wing will say, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1533.6399999999999s)]
*  no way, man, you saw fake news, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1535.4399999999998s)]
*  etc. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1537.08s)]
*  And the left wing will say, no, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1537.6599999999999s)]
*  we know for sure. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1539.62s)]
*  None of us know for sure. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1541.1399999999999s)]
*  But right now it doesn't look good. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1542.3799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of blowups at [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1543.62s)]
*  the Defense Department. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1544.62s)]
*  It looks like a mess. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1545.6599999999999s)]
*  He accidentally leaked our war [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1546.5s)]
*  plans several different times. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1548.3s)]
*  So if they're looking for [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1550.5s)]
*  a replacement, it wouldn't be [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1551.5s)]
*  earth shattering news, right? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1552.9399999999998s)]
*  And it makes some degree of sense. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1555.1s)]
*  But then if Trump decides to stick [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1556.46s)]
*  with him, then they'll pretend the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1557.9399999999998s)]
*  whole thing was fake news in [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1559.4199999999998s)]
*  the first place. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1560.58s)]
*  But to me, that's not [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1561.5s)]
*  the important part. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1562.46s)]
*  The important part is, why are they [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1563.3s)]
*  trying to replace him? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1565.74s)]
*  Is it because he's got some [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1567.58s)]
*  personal issues or [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1569.1799999999998s)]
*  whatever else it might be? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1570.1799999999998s)]
*  Or for policy reasons, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1571.6999999999998s)]
*  that's the most relevant part. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1573.1s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1574.82s)]
*  Further, Erickson says it's not [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1576.26s)]
*  the President, but those around him [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1577.82s)]
*  who expect more shoes to drop that [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1579.6599999999999s)]
*  turn the President against Hegseth [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1581.3s)]
*  and they're trying to get ready for [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1583.1399999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1584.86s)]
*  So buckle up. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1585.36s)]
*  It seems like there might be some [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1586.6999999999998s)]
*  more revelations coming from [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1588.1799999999998s)]
*  the Defense Department. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1589.54s)]

*  we'll see what it is. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1591.78s)]
*  Yeah, and look, the fact that it's [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1593.02s)]
*  both NPR and [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1595.3s)]

*  confirming from people inside [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1598.54s)]
*  the White House that they're [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1600.34s)]
*  looking at a list. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1602.2199999999998s)]
*  By the way, they're saying, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1603.58s)]
*  it's not Trump that's looking at [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1604.62s)]
*  the list, they're going to take it [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1605.8999999999999s)]
*  to Trump. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1607.2199999999998s)]
*  It's other people making a list. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1607.9399999999998s)]
*  By the way, that also, if I was in [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1609.4599999999998s)]
*  the White House and I was the chief [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1610.8999999999999s)]

*  Because I'd be thinking, well, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1614.6999999999998s)]
*  we might have to make a decision. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1616.06s)]
*  If we have to make a decision, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1617.86s)]
*  I want to be able to give [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1619.1799999999998s)]
*  the President some options. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1620.1399999999999s)]
*  And part of the reason I tell you [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1621.54s)]
*  guys all that is, if you're [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1622.86s)]
*  independent or right-winger, and [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1624.02s)]
*  you see stories like this and [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1625.78s)]
*  your initial reaction is always [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1627.1399999999999s)]
*  fake news, just calm down, okay? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1628.78s)]
*  It could be real and [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1631.7399999999998s)]
*  they keep Hegseth anyway, right? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1632.9399999999998s)]
*  Not everything is fake news and [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1635.7399999999998s)]
*  not all discussions of turmoil at [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1637.82s)]
*  the White House is meant to [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1640.26s)]
*  destroy Trump. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1642.2199999999998s)]
*  It could just be a thing that's [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1643.9799999999998s)]
*  happening, that's all. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1645.34s)]
*  So we'll see what happens and [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1647.1799999999998s)]
*  we'll stay on the story as it [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1648.1799999999998s)]

*  And it's going to be a very [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1677.62s)]
*  different story, but [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1679.22s)]
*  we're going to be talking about [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1680.42s)]
*  the deportation and deportation of [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1682.46s)]

*  the deportation and deportation of [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1688.06s)]

*  the whole deportation debacle with [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1691.5s)]
*  the Trump administration, so [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1693.4199999999998s)]
*  let's get right to it. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1695.06s)]
*  But then there's also legitimate [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1696.3799999999999s)]
*  arguments on the other side. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1697.98s)]
*  The other side is making a very [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1699.3799999999999s)]
*  legitimate argument about the right [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1700.86s)]
*  to due process if you get [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1702.6599999999999s)]
*  processed and shipped out of [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1703.86s)]

*  El Salvador. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1707.1799999999998s)]
*  We have to make sure that these [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1707.9399999999998s)]
*  people are actually guilty, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1709.54s)]
*  otherwise we become monsters. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1711.1799999999998s)]
*  You can't, what is that, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1712.8999999999999s)]
*  when you fight monsters, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1714.3s)]
*  be careful that you don't become [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1715.6599999999999s)]
*  one? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1717.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1717.82s)]
*  That's very important. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1718.4199999999998s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1720.06s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1720.8600000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration is [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1725.1s)]
*  apparently eroding foundational [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1727.1s)]
*  American values so brazenly that [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1729.78s)]
*  Joe Rogan, one of the individuals [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1732.42s)]
*  who endorsed Trump and voted for [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1734.82s)]
*  him in the last presidential [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1737.14s)]
*  election is now speaking out [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1739.1s)]
*  against him. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1741.14s)]
*  Now Donald Trump, meanwhile, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1741.94s)]
*  is pulling new unbelievable tricks [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1743.74s)]
*  to basically defend his [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1745.78s)]
*  administration's decision to [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1747.3s)]
*  return him to the United States [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1749.1s)]
*  despite the fact that the Supreme [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1751.06s)]
*  Court has ordered him to do so. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1753.06s)]
*  But before we get to that, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1755.58s)]
*  here's more from Rogan. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1756.9399999999998s)]
*  He had Tim Dillon on his podcast [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1758.1799999999998s)]
*  episode when he was making these [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1760.1399999999999s)]
*  points and Dillon seemed to agree [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1762.1399999999999s)]
*  with him as well. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1764.1s)]
*  But he's talking about the [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1765.06s)]
*  importance of due process here. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1766.4199999999998s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1768.1799999999998s)]
*  Here it is, Benjamin Franklin. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1770.1s)]
*  It's better 100 guilty persons [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1771.6999999999998s)]
*  should escape than one innocent [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1773.3799999999999s)]
*  person should suffer. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1774.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm on that side of things. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1776.02s)]
*  I mean, I think due process exists [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1778.58s)]
*  for a reason and the reason is, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1780.6200000000001s)]
*  it is horrific for someone to be [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1782.46s)]
*  accused of something they didn't do, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1784.38s)]
*  be imprisoned for crimes they [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1786.66s)]
*  didn't commit and then live in [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1788.5s)]
*  a cell, live in a cage with a bunch [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1790.38s)]
*  of- [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1792.42s)]
*  People who did commit. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1792.94s)]
*  That is wisdom. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1794.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1795.74s)]
*  That has survived hundreds of [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1796.38s)]
*  years, it's incredibly accurate and [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1798.18s)]
*  it is the foundation of freedom. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1800.54s)]
*  So that was actually the episode [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1804.98s)]
*  with Derek Poston. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1806.82s)]
*  But he also made similar points [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1808.82s)]
*  while Tim Dillon was on his show. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1810.42s)]
*  So he's been talking about this [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1812.22s)]
*  repeatedly, which I'm grateful for [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1813.82s)]
*  because I think the points he's [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1815.78s)]
*  making here are incredibly [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1817.34s)]
*  important. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1818.66s)]
*  Due process is important. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1819.42s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you are a fan [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1820.62s)]
*  of Abrego Garcia. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1822.46s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you want to [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1824.06s)]
*  be an advocate for him. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1825.3s)]
*  It means that you believe in [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1826.3799999999999s)]
*  the rule of law and due process [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1827.7s)]
*  when someone is accused of [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1829.22s)]
*  something. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1830.42s)]
*  In this case, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1831.46s)]
*  we have not gotten due process and [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1832.18s)]
*  it's not just Rogan who's honestly [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1833.98s)]
*  more left leaning. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1836.06s)]
*  He's like a more left leaning Trump [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1837.18s)]
*  voter. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1839.1s)]
*  It's also conservative, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1839.66s)]
*  legal commentators like this guy [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1841.62s)]
*  named Andy McCarthy. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1843.9s)]
*  He was on Fox News and he also [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1845.42s)]
*  ripped the Trump administration on [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1847.18s)]
*  this. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1849.54s)]
*  Let's take a quick look at that. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1850.1s)]
*  There's no question that there was [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1853.58s)]
*  an order, he was not supposed to be [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1856.1s)]
*  sent as Senator Kennedy said that [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1858.78s)]
*  was a screw up. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1861.42s)]
*  In 20 years at the Justice [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1862.86s)]
*  Department, I had plenty of screw [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1864.5s)]
*  ups, but the thing is when the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1866.38s)]
*  government screws up, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1867.98s)]
*  it's supposed to fix it. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1869.22s)]
*  And what these guys are basically [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1870.6200000000001s)]
*  saying is, yeah, we screwed up. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1872.42s)]
*  So what? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1873.98s)]
*  They've sent him to El Salvador. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1874.66s)]
*  The government if it was doing [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1876.82s)]
*  the right thing, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1878.18s)]
*  the Trump administration should be [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1878.98s)]
*  trying to bring him back so [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1880.74s)]
*  he can have whatever proceedings [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1882.18s)]
*  he is entitled to to challenge his [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1884.18s)]
*  deportation. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1886.26s)]
*  I don't understand what Attorney [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1887.14s)]
*  General Bondi is doing here, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1889.38s)]
*  frankly. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1891.42s)]
*  So again, that was a conservative. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1893.3s)]
*  Okay, you have Rogan, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1896.18s)]
*  you have a conservative legal [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1897.18s)]
*  commentator on Fox News making kind [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1898.46s)]
*  of similar points here about [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1899.98s)]
*  the importance of due process. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1901.34s)]
*  And admitting when you've made [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1903.1s)]
*  a mistake, which by the way, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1904.62s)]
*  the White House lawyers have [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1905.98s)]
*  admitted in legal filings. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1907.58s)]
*  But you still have people like [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1909.6599999999999s)]
*  White House Press Secretary [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1911.1s)]
*  Caroline Levitt denying that [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1912.5s)]
*  a mistake was made in deporting [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1914.02s)]
*  Abrego Garcia. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1915.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so look, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1916.78s)]
*  on Abrego Garcia, there's two [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1917.82s)]
*  issues that are important. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1919.7s)]
*  And there's tons of confusion on [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1921.46s)]
*  about the other stuff that is not [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1923.42s)]
*  important. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1925.5s)]
*  So in 2019, the last order, court [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1926.22s)]
*  order on Abrego Garcia is, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1929.18s)]
*  do not deport, period, okay? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1931.54s)]
*  So they deport him even though [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1936.14s)]
*  there's an outstanding court order [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1937.46s)]
*  saying do not deport this guy, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1939.02s)]
*  okay? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1940.5800000000002s)]
*  So that means they have to bring [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1941.8200000000002s)]
*  him back, period, full stop. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1943.6200000000001s)]
*  There's a court order and then all [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1945.42s)]
*  the courts since then have [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1947.14s)]
*  confirmed there's a court order you [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1948.42s)]
*  turn him, including the Supreme [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1950.18s)]
*  Court, nine to nothing, right? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1951.74s)]
*  And even Alito saying, look, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1953.8200000000002s)]
*  I didn't like the way that we [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1955.42s)]
*  ruled and my colleagues ruled and [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1956.7s)]
*  etc, etc. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1958.38s)]
*  But of course he's got to bring him [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1960.5s)]
*  back because you have to listen to [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1961.6200000000001s)]
*  the courts. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1962.5800000000002s)]
*  And he's not going to listen. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1963.26s)]
*  That's the thing, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1964.74s)]
*  the Trump administration refuses [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1965.5s)]
*  to listen. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1966.98s)]
*  They're playing this ridiculous [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1967.66s)]
*  game where they're like, I mean, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1969.18s)]
*  we can't force Bukele to do it. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1970.98s)]
*  And then Bukele, okay, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1973.3400000000001s)]
*  that's the president of El [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1974.42s)]
*  Salvador for those who don't know [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1975.5400000000002s)]
*  who I'm talking about. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1976.98s)]
*  But then Bukele is like, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1978.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't have the power to send him [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1980.1s)]
*  back to the United States. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1981.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you think we're stupid? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1982.46s)]
*  We're not stupid. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1983.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1985.02s)]
*  Like Trump and Bukele, they're [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1985.54s)]
*  like, I don't know how to bring [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1986.74s)]
*  him back. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1987.86s)]
*  Golly gee, where is he? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1988.3799999999999s)]
*  Come on, come on, man. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1989.86s)]
*  All right, so now the second thing [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1991.3799999999999s)]
*  that's super important about [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1993.22s)]
*  Abrego Garcia is it is not [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1994.82s)]
*  an immigration issue. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1996.22s)]
*  It's a due process issue. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1998.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=1999.66s)]
*  Rogan's 100% right. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2000.18s)]
*  It doesn't matter who [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2001.98s)]
*  Abrego Garcia is and it doesn't. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2003.22s)]
*  All of that is for [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2004.82s)]
*  the courts to decide, not for [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2006.06s)]
*  Yahoo's on X and Instagram to [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2008.18s)]
*  decide, right? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2010.38s)]
*  I think he's this, I think he's, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2011.74s)]
*  I don't care what you think. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2013.5s)]
*  Sorry, okay? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2014.94s)]
*  And by the way, the court shouldn't [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2016.02s)]
*  care what I think either. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2017.46s)]
*  They should do a real process [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2018.5s)]
*  because this isn't about his [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2020.54s)]
*  rights, this is about our rights. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2022.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2023.6200000000001s)]
*  Because as Rogan is pointing out [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2024.26s)]
*  here, if he doesn't have due [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2026.02s)]
*  process, we don't have due process. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2027.66s)]
*  Period, guys. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2029.98s)]
*  You have to get that through [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2031.22s)]
*  your head. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2032.38s)]
*  If the concept of due process does [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2032.8600000000001s)]
*  not exist anymore, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2034.66s)]
*  it doesn't exist for anyone. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2035.7s)]
*  That means you don't have to go to [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2037.5s)]
*  court to arrest anyone, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2039.3s)]
*  deport anyone, etc. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2040.46s)]
*  It just means that the government, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2041.9s)]
*  okay, the big bad government that [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2043.94s)]
*  conservatives complain about all [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2045.78s)]
*  the time can literally unilaterally [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2047.74s)]
*  point to anyone, accuse them of [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2050.02s)]
*  anything, and punish them without [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2052.18s)]
*  due process. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2054.58s)]
*  We don't want to live in [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2056.22s)]
*  a country like that. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2057.18s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2057.98s)]
*  We don't want to live in [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2058.7s)]
*  a country like that. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2059.7s)]
*  Look, I know all about the reports [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2060.66s)]
*  in regard to Abrego Garcia, right? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2063.06s)]
*  His wife had pursued a restraining [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2066.22s)]
*  order against him, yada yada. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2068.2599999999998s)]
*  I get all that. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2070.18s)]
*  I'm not like someone who's sitting [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2071.14s)]
*  here specifically to talk about [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2072.9s)]
*  what a stand up guy Abrego Garcia [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2074.74s)]
*  is, it's not about him in [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2076.38s)]
*  particular. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2077.74s)]
*  It's about the rule of law and [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2078.34s)]
*  the fact that there is a process in [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2080.18s)]
*  place to prevent innocent people [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2082.38s)]
*  from getting inaccurately accused [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2084.62s)]
*  of crimes they did not commit and [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2086.98s)]
*  then being punished for [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2089.02s)]
*  crimes they did not commit. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2090.46s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2092.38s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2093.14s)]
*  And look here, you can tell as [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2093.74s)]
*  usual, we've been the one show [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2095.3399999999997s)]
*  that's principled and [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2096.9399999999996s)]
*  honest about this. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2098.06s)]
*  Because under the Obama [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2099.2599999999998s)]
*  administration, when they killed [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2100.4599999999996s)]
*  Anwar Al-Ablaqi, you were an [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2102.18s)]
*  American citizen, they claimed the [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2103.54s)]
*  due process was not necessarily [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2105.3799999999997s)]
*  a judicial process. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2107.14s)]
*  And we went nuts over it. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2108.3399999999997s)]
*  We're like- [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2110.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2110.8399999999997s)]
*  And I thought that the Attorney [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2111.3399999999997s)]
*  General there, Eric Holder, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2112.9399999999996s)]
*  should have been fired instantly. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2114.3799999999997s)]
*  And I said I was embarrassed that [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2116.14s)]
*  he spoke at my graduation at [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2117.8599999999997s)]
*  Columbia and he's one of the alumni [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2119.3399999999997s)]
*  there, so there's a lot of reasons [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2121.3399999999997s)]
*  to be embarrassed by [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2123.06s)]
*  Columbia these days, right? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2124.06s)]
*  Because of course it's [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2125.7s)]
*  judicial process. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2126.7799999999997s)]
*  What do you mean it's not [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2127.74s)]
*  a judicial process? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2128.58s)]
*  That's exactly what due process is. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2129.34s)]
*  So Obama was 200% wrong there and [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2131.38s)]
*  Trump is 200% wrong here. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2133.7799999999997s)]
*  But I love that you brought up [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2135.98s)]
*  Obama because it's a perfect example [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2137.98s)]
*  of something that we've been saying [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2140.54s)]
*  on this show for years now. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2143.02s)]
*  When your guy, when your preferred [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2144.86s)]
*  candidate wins the election, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2147.02s)]
*  you're going to be the one to [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2148.9s)]
*  be the one to be the one to win. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2150.46s)]
*  And that's what I love about [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2152.22s)]
*  this show. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2154.02s)]
*  It's a show that's so [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2154.62s)]
*  relevant to the president. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2155.7s)]
*  It's a show that's so [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2157.42s)]
*  relevant to the president. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2158.46s)]
*  And it's a show that's so [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2160.1s)]
*  relevant to the president. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2161.34s)]
*  And I think that's the thing [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2162.7400000000002s)]
*  that if your preferred candidate [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2164.3s)]
*  wins the election and [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2166.1800000000003s)]
*  is in the White House, if they [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2167.42s)]
*  carry out acts that are counter to [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2169.3s)]
*  our constitutional rights, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2171.46s)]
*  if they behave badly, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2173.5800000000004s)]
*  they basically set a precedent that [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2175.1800000000003s)]
*  allows the second administration [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2177.5800000000004s)]
*  that might be run by a guy you [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2179.7000000000003s)]
*  don't like to carry out whatever [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2181.46s)]
*  they would like to carry out. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2183.46s)]
*  And in fact, so [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2185.5400000000004s)]
*  I'll build on that real quick too. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2186.26s)]
*  Because back then, when we were [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2187.98s)]
*  living over that, everybody said, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2189.5800000000004s)]
*  no, no, no, don't criticize Obama. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2191.46s)]
*  Don't, don't, don't criticize [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2193.06s)]
*  Obama, because what if [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2194.54s)]
*  the Republicans win? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2195.66s)]
*  What do you mean what if [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2197.06s)]
*  the Republicans win? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2197.62s)]
*  He already said that he'd like to [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2198.22s)]
*  destroy due process. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2199.74s)]
*  I don't need Republicans to do [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2201.22s)]
*  worse, that's already terrible, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2202.58s)]
*  right? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2204.02s)]
*  And so look, there's a thousand [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2204.54s)]
*  other factors that go into who you [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2206.02s)]
*  vote for, right? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2207.66s)]
*  And so I vote for those Republicans [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2208.86s)]
*  because I thought they would do [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2210.54s)]
*  things like this. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2211.9s)]
*  And I was really worried about [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2212.7s)]
*  Trump saying he wanted to terminate [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2213.9s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2215.18s)]
*  And here we are constantly trying [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2216.02s)]
*  to chip away at the Constitution [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2217.9s)]
*  for no reason. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2219.46s)]
*  He had a giant win on immigration. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2220.42s)]
*  He closed down the border. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2222.42s)]
*  People loved it, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2223.7000000000003s)]
*  the polling went through the roof. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2224.46s)]
*  And then he comes in, he's like, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2226.1s)]
*  yeah, but I don't want to follow [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2227.1s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2228.02s)]
*  And now his polling is dropping 10 [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2228.9s)]
*  points. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2230.38s)]
*  And so he turned a win into a loss. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2230.98s)]
*  Why? He wants to attack [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2233.58s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2235.1s)]
*  But if you're on Trump's side, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2236.02s)]
*  you don't want to hear it. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2237.34s)]
*  No, no, no, I love it. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2238.06s)]
*  Attacking the Constitution is [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2239.38s)]
*  great. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2240.46s)]
*  When you were on Obama's side [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2240.98s)]
*  earlier, if you were a Democrat, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2242.02s)]
*  and you didn't want to hear it. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2243.2200000000003s)]
*  And mainstream media, by the way, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2244.1s)]
*  when Trump does it, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2245.54s)]
*  they go ballistic, right? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2246.34s)]
*  And they should, good, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2247.9s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2248.94s)]
*  When Obama did it, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2249.94s)]
*  there was almost no coverage at all. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2250.98s)]
*  100%. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2253.38s)]
*  So speaking of the media going [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2254.42s)]
*  ballistic, I mean, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2256.02s)]
*  they keep asking Trump to explain [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2257.18s)]
*  himself and explain how it is that [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2259.02s)]
*  it's totally okay to not listen to [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2260.98s)]
*  a Supreme Court ruling and [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2263.06s)]
*  continue deporting people without [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2264.66s)]
*  due process. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2266.86s)]
*  Here's what Trump says, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2267.78s)]
*  if we don't get these criminals out [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2269.34s)]
*  of our country, we are not going to [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2271.42s)]
*  have a country any longer. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2273.5s)]
*  Okay, but who determines whether or [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2275.06s)]
*  not the individual you're accusing [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2277.1s)]
*  of being a criminal is actually [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2278.98s)]
*  in fact a criminal? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2280.8599999999997s)]
*  That's where the courts come in. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2283.14s)]
*  And by the way, again, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2285.66s)]
*  just to reiterate, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2286.7799999999997s)]
*  Abrego Garcia was not in [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2287.62s)]
*  the country illegally, okay? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2288.7799999999997s)]
*  He had a legitimate asylum claim [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2290.62s)]
*  according to what the court said, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2292.8999999999996s)]
*  and he had protected status to [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2295.2599999999998s)]
*  remain in the United States. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2297.2999999999997s)]
*  So for those who are saying, well, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2299.2999999999997s)]
*  even if he's not an MS-13 gang [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2301.1s)]
*  member or a gang member in general, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2302.66s)]
*  who cares? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2304.54s)]
*  He was in the country illegally, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2305.2599999999998s)]
*  except he wasn't. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2307.02s)]
*  And Trump continues to say, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2308.7400000000002s)]
*  we cannot give everyone a trial. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2310.5800000000004s)]

*  because to do so would take, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2315.6200000000003s)]
*  without exaggeration, 200 years. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2317.26s)]
*  We would need hundreds of thousands [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2319.7000000000003s)]
*  of trials for the hundreds of [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2321.6200000000003s)]
*  thousands of illegals we are [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2323.0600000000004s)]
*  sending out of the country. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2324.5s)]
*  Okay, but what happens if you're [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2325.9s)]
*  accusing someone who's actually [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2327.34s)]
*  an American citizen of being in [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2328.78s)]
*  the country illegally, and [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2330.1800000000003s)]
*  you deport that individual? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2331.34s)]
*  And not only that, in this case, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2333.1400000000003s)]
*  they didn't just deport him, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2334.5800000000004s)]
*  they sent him to a hellhole on [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2335.82s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2337.0600000000004s)]
*  One of the worst prisons in [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2338.06s)]
*  the world. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2339.18s)]
*  And the reason they told the courts [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2339.98s)]
*  order that he should not be [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2341.66s)]
*  deported is because he had a [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2343.06s)]
*  legitimate fear of being harmed by [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2344.62s)]
*  gangs in El Salvador. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2346.62s)]
*  That prison is filled with gangs [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2348.22s)]
*  from El Salvador. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2349.7799999999997s)]
*  You couldn't have sent him to [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2351.1s)]
*  a worse place, and you're going to [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2352.3399999999997s)]
*  do that without due process? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2353.7s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2354.74s)]
*  So look, for me, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2355.8999999999996s)]
*  the last couple of things here. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2356.8999999999996s)]
*  So first off, due process is [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2358.8599999999997s)]
*  the cornerstone of [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2360.3799999999997s)]
*  Western civilization. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2361.4199999999996s)]
*  So don't tell me we're not going to [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2362.8999999999996s)]
*  have a country anymore if we do [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2364.3799999999997s)]
*  due process. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2365.62s)]
*  We literally won't have a country [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2366.62s)]
*  if we don't do due process. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2368.38s)]
*  Then we'll just have a normal [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2370.38s)]
*  authoritarian or [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2371.54s)]
*  dictatorial government that [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2372.3399999999997s)]
*  has been around forever and [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2373.7799999999997s)]
*  ever and ever. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2375.14s)]
*  What makes America special and [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2375.7799999999997s)]
*  awesome is that we believe in [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2377.2599999999998s)]
*  Western civilization. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2378.8199999999997s)]
*  We believe in those foundational [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2380.02s)]
*  rights that we have as citizens. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2382.2599999999998s)]
*  And due process might be the [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2384.8599999999997s)]
*  single most important one. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2386.2999999999997s)]
*  That's why we were so [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2388.06s)]
*  upset at Obama earlier, right? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2389.02s)]
*  And so last things from the members [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2390.8599999999997s)]
*  that Dubser dog writes in just as [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2393.2599999999998s)]
*  a fun part, due process is woke. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2395.66s)]
*  And a lot of right wingers are [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2398.8199999999997s)]
*  saying that, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2400.2999999999997s)]
*  no due process is nonsense. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2401.16s)]
*  Guys, it is America. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2402.94s)]
*  Okay, but I don't want to hear any [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2403.62s)]
*  of them complain if a democratic [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2404.66s)]
*  president points to any of [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2405.8599999999997s)]
*  the conservatives and accuses them [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2407.02s)]

*  alleged crime without giving them [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2410.58s)]
*  a day in court. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2412.66s)]
*  In fact, well, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2414.1s)]
*  that's what this is. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2414.7799999999997s)]
*  Let's run a poll to January 6 guys [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2415.62s)]
*  if a Democrat wins. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2416.94s)]
*  Let's just send them to [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2417.98s)]
*  El Salvador and say, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2418.62s)]
*  there's nothing we can do. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2419.22s)]
*  We can't get them back. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2420.06s)]
*  We can't get them back. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2420.94s)]
*  Well, how you can't do that? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2421.5s)]
*  Well, you don't have due process [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2422.2999999999997s)]
*  anymore, so [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2423.38s)]
*  we can do anything we like. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2423.74s)]
*  So that's not America. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2425.06s)]
*  And Trisha Briggs, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2426.5s)]
*  thank you for pointing that. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2427.18s)]
*  Joe Rogan making a good point [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2427.98s)]
*  again, these are YouTube members. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2429.2599999999998s)]
*  Hit the join button to become [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2431.34s)]
*  part of the show. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2432.7799999999997s)]
*  She says, are we in the upside [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2433.66s)]
*  down? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2434.94s)]
*  Yeah, but look guys, that's why [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2435.86s)]
*  everything including these hosts [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2437.46s)]
*  are not black and white. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2439.2999999999997s)]
*  Other shows want to tell you they're [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2440.7s)]
*  all black and white. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2442.2999999999997s)]
*  If they voted for Trump, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2443.46s)]
*  they're all Nazis and evil, etc. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2444.5s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2446.2999999999997s)]
*  Joe Rogan is not a leftist. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2447.1s)]
*  He has some left wing positions, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2448.9s)]
*  some right wing positions. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2450.38s)]
*  He's independent, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2451.94s)]
*  whether you like it or not. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2452.7799999999997s)]
*  And there's a whole bunch of his [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2454.46s)]
*  opinions I don't like. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2455.66s)]
*  But that's not how the world works. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2456.86s)]
*  I don't like some of his opinions, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2458.86s)]
*  hence he's a Nazi. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2460.34s)]
*  No, no. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2461.02s)]
*  And so in this case, he did what I [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2462.5s)]
*  thought he would do, which is [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2465.02s)]
*  actually stand up for our rights. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2467.34s)]
*  And let's be honest, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2469.9s)]
*  who on the left said he would? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2471.18s)]
*  No one, right? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2472.7400000000002s)]
*  And he did. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2473.98s)]
*  And it makes a difference because [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2474.98s)]
*  he's part of the guys who help [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2476.9s)]
*  Trump win. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2478.5s)]
*  And if you say, well, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2479.1s)]
*  that's why I hate him, I hear you. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2480.18s)]
*  But he's also part of the guys now [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2481.98s)]
*  attacking Trump, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2483.7s)]
*  which is a good thing. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2484.74s)]
*  Okay, I hate when you say final [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2486.5s)]
*  thing because there's more that I [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2488.06s)]
*  want to share with the audience. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2489.74s)]
*  Okay, all right, so [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2491.14s)]
*  I want to talk just quickly about [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2492.22s)]
*  what Trump put out there in terms [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2493.98s)]
*  of evidence that Abrego Garcia is [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2495.8599999999997s)]
*  part of MS 13. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2497.9399999999996s)]
*  So let's go to graphic one here. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2500.14s)]
*  It's a post by Donald Trump. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2502.2999999999997s)]
*  He's a photoshopped image, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2503.58s)]
*  by the way. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2505.66s)]
*  And in it, he says this is the hand [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2507.2599999999998s)]
*  of a man that Democrats feel should [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2509.18s)]
*  be brought back to the United [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2511.02s)]
*  States because he is such [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2512.62s)]
*  a fine and innocent person. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2513.82s)]
*  They said he is not a member of MS [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2516.14s)]
*  13 even though he's got MS 13 [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2517.9s)]
*  tattooed on his knuckles and [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2519.5s)]
*  two highly respected courts found [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2521.06s)]
*  that he was a member of MS 13, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2523.06s)]
*  did they? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2524.94s)]
*  Okay, beat up his wife, etc. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2526.1s)]
*  I was elected to take bad people [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2528.9s)]
*  out of the United States, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2530.9s)]
*  among other things. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2532.46s)]
*  I must be allowed to do my job, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2533.74s)]
*  make America great again. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2535.14s)]
*  But look, let's take a tighter shot, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2536.58s)]
*  there we go, of the alleged MS 13 [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2539.18s)]
*  tattoos. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2542.1s)]
*  The MS 13 was photoshopped onto [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2543.7s)]
*  the image, those are not tattoos [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2545.66s)]
*  that he actually has. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2547.8599999999997s)]
*  The tattoos do include a marijuana [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2549.4599999999996s)]
*  leaf, a smiley face, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2552.58s)]
*  I guess that's a sign of MS 13. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2554.74s)]
*  And then there's a cross and [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2557.9399999999996s)]
*  a skull. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2560.2999999999997s)]
*  A cross? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2561.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I heard people saying that [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2562.3799999999997s)]
*  Pete Hegseth shouldn't get [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2564.1s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense job, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2565.3399999999997s)]
*  because he had cross tattoos. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2566.74s)]
*  But maybe this guy should get it. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2568.7799999999997s)]
*  Have you guys seen MS 13 tattoos or [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2570.5s)]
*  MS 13 gang members and [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2572.62s)]
*  the type of gang tattoos they have? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2574.02s)]
*  They have MS 13 [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2576.5s)]
*  scrawled across their forehead. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2577.94s)]
*  Okay, they're not doing little [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2581.14s)]
*  secret symbols. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2583.06s)]
*  They're not like, hey, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2584.46s)]
*  how you doing? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2585.5s)]
*  Cross, okay, you should interpret [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2586.1s)]
*  it, right? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2588.66s)]
*  No, a weed, wow, weed, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2589.9s)]
*  that sounds super dangerous. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2591.86s)]
*  By the way, let the courts [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2594.74s)]
*  adjudicate whether or not he's [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2596.02s)]
*  actually a member of MS 13. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2597.54s)]
*  What does the Trump [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2599.02s)]
*  administration so afraid of? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2599.86s)]
*  Yeah, and it's embarrassing for [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2601.78s)]
*  the President to put up [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2603.6600000000003s)]
*  a Photoshop picture. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2604.94s)]
*  It's- [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2606.38s)]
*  And get caught on it instantly. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2606.94s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2608.6200000000003s)]
*  But I already said last thing. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2610.6200000000003s)]
*  All right, fair enough. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2612.54s)]
*  Let's take a break. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2614.06s)]
*  When we come back, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2615.06s)]
*  we'll get to that Federal Reserve [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2615.7000000000003s)]
*  story I was promising earlier. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2616.98s)]
*  All right, we're back. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2618.1s)]
*  Cenk, Ana, Michaela the barber. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2639.54s)]
*  What a fun handle. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2642.18s)]
*  Michaela, thanks for hitting [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2643.3399999999997s)]

*  And Siberio Kovonic, thank you for [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2646.74s)]
*  gifting a membership. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2648.8599999999997s)]
*  As I just read you, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2650.98s)]
*  one of our members just activated [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2651.7s)]
*  the gift subscription for [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2653.1s)]
*  their mom and [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2654.14s)]
*  she's watching along now. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2654.7s)]
*  So that makes a big difference and [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2655.98s)]
*  we appreciate you guys. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2657.14s)]
*  Casper. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2658.4199999999996s)]
*  We got to talk about this ongoing [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2659.5s)]
*  feud between Donald Trump and [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2661.3399999999997s)]
*  the Federal Reserve Chair, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2663.14s)]
*  Jerome Powell. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2664.8999999999996s)]
*  Because Powell is unwilling to go [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2666.02s)]
*  along with the demands that [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2668.14s)]
*  the President has. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2669.8599999999997s)]
*  And Trump doesn't like that. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2671.74s)]
*  So let's take a look. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2672.8599999999997s)]
*  He wrote, quote, Jerome Powell of [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2673.62s)]
*  the Fed, who is always too late and [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2675.8199999999997s)]
*  wrong, he said in all caps, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2677.94s)]
*  yesterday issued a report which was [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2679.58s)]
*  another and typical complete mess. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2681.66s)]
*  He went on to say that Powell's [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2684.06s)]
*  termination could not come fast [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2686.06s)]
*  enough. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2688.1s)]
*  You've reiterated that you intend [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2688.66s)]
*  to stay in office until the end of [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2690.94s)]
*  your term. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2692.98s)]
*  And that certainly reassured many [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2693.9s)]
*  in financial markets. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2695.66s)]
*  Our independence is a matter of [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2697.02s)]
*  law. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2698.54s)]
*  Congress has, in our statute, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2699.9s)]
*  were not removable except for [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2702.02s)]
*  cause. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2703.78s)]
*  Well, the stock market was in [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2704.34s)]
*  freefall again today after [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2706.5s)]
*  President Donald Trump called his [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2708.42s)]
*  own Federal Reserve Chair, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2710.78s)]
*  Jerome Powell, a loser. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2712.92s)]
*  Now Trump is very upset with Powell [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2714.7000000000003s)]
*  because of the fact that Powell is [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2717.1400000000003s)]
*  unwilling to lower interest rates. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2719.5s)]
*  In fact, in a recent update that we [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2722.1800000000003s)]
*  received from Powell, he basically [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2724.5s)]
*  cited that Trump's tariffs policy [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2726.98s)]
*  is very likely going to lead to [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2729.1800000000003s)]
*  more inflation. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2731.06s)]
*  And as a result of that, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2732.58s)]
*  the Federal Reserve is unwilling to [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2733.9s)]
*  lower interest rates, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2735.94s)]
*  which is something that Trump [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2737.26s)]
*  really, really wants Powell to do, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2738.78s)]
*  Cenk. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2740.58s)]
*  Yeah, he better be careful what he [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2741.1s)]
*  wishes for. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2742.66s)]
*  So lowering the interest rates [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2743.22s)]
*  stimulates the economy. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2745.22s)]
*  And Trump is in his first term, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2746.9s)]
*  pressured the head of the Federal [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2748.58s)]
*  Reserve to lower interest rates [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2750.46s)]
*  over and over again. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2752.34s)]
*  And look, we were headed in that [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2753.7400000000002s)]
*  direction anyway and they did, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2755.42s)]
*  right? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2757.06s)]
*  So you can't tell if they respond [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2757.58s)]
*  to pressure or [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2759.14s)]
*  going that way. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2759.82s)]
*  So did it help his economic [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2760.7000000000003s)]
*  numbers immensely? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2762.7400000000002s)]
*  But when you're worried about [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2764.82s)]
*  inflation, lowering the interest [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2766.6200000000003s)]
*  rate is the exact wrong move, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2768.5800000000004s)]
*  because it could overstimulate [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2770.2200000000003s)]
*  the economy and [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2771.96s)]
*  leading to higher prices. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2772.7000000000003s)]
*  But now with the tariffs, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2774.1800000000003s)]
*  we're already risking going back [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2775.5400000000004s)]
*  into inflation pretty significantly. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2777.26s)]
*  If you lower the interest rates, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2779.9s)]
*  that's a double whammy and [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2781.46s)]
*  could actually destroy the economy. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2782.6200000000003s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2784.42s)]
*  So Powell is doing what he's [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2784.98s)]
*  supposed to do. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2786.1800000000003s)]
*  We got issues with the Federal [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2787.0600000000004s)]
*  Reserve overall. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2788.5400000000004s)]
*  But as a chair here, he's supposed [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2789.58s)]
*  to balance inflation and [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2791.66s)]
*  unemployment and come to a number [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2793.14s)]
*  that's best for the economy and [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2795.06s)]
*  do that objectively and not based [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2796.86s)]
*  on the political whims of [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2798.84s)]
*  the president. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2800.38s)]
*  And he is absolutely doing his job. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2801.5s)]
*  The reason the market went down [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2803.5s)]
*  nearly 1,000 points today is [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2805.06s)]
*  because one of the things that is [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2806.62s)]
*  true is that the market thinks [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2808.42s)]
*  Powell was doing a good job and [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2810.08s)]
*  he's a good steward of the economy. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2811.74s)]
*  because he's been now through [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2813.74s)]
*  a couple of presidents. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2815.54s)]
*  And he's done a pretty good job of [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2817.02s)]
*  modulating the interest rates in [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2818.9s)]
*  a professional way. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2820.98s)]
*  And they're worried that if Trump [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2822.3s)]
*  gets rid of him and puts in some [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2824.3s)]
*  dumbass lackey, that it's going to [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2826.1s)]
*  absolutely destroy the markets. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2828.2000000000003s)]
*  So that's why the market had itself [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2830.38s)]
*  again today. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2832.1s)]
*  By the way, Trump was warned about [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2833.1s)]
*  this by some of his top advisors. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2834.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2836.06s)]
*  And as usual, he didn't listen. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2836.58s)]
*  Yeah, and also, I mean, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2838.5s)]
*  when you think about the tariffs, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2839.94s)]
*  if Trump really does go forward [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2841.98s)]
*  with some of the more astronomical [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2843.78s)]
*  tariffs against our trade partners. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2845.94s)]
*  And by the way, that is on top of [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2848.7s)]
*  the 10% baseline tariff that he's [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2850.62s)]
*  slapping onto every country. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2852.66s)]
*  It's going to lead to [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2854.8199999999997s)]
*  unemployment too. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2856.5s)]
*  It's not just going to be [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2858.22s)]
*  inflation. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2859.46s)]
*  And there are companies within [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2860.7799999999997s)]
*  the United States that rely on [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2862.3599999999997s)]
*  foreign made parts or foreign [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2863.98s)]
*  products in order to run their [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2865.5s)]
*  business here in the United States. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2867.1s)]
*  And if they can't afford those [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2869.4199999999996s)]
*  products because of the high [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2871.2599999999998s)]
*  tariffs or if their customers are [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2872.8999999999996s)]
*  unwilling to bear the financial [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2874.8599999999997s)]
*  burden of the inflation that comes [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2876.7799999999997s)]
*  along with those tariffs, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2878.66s)]
*  they're going to go out of business [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2880.14s)]
*  and that's going to increase [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2882.02s)]
*  unemployment. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2883.66s)]
*  And that's like a crazy combination [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2884.58s)]
*  of higher unemployment, yet [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2887.14s)]
*  you also have inflation that [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2889.2999999999997s)]
*  remains and could get worse. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2891.3799999999997s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2893.8199999999997s)]
*  everybody's so worried about [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2895.4199999999996s)]
*  a recession, because Trump is [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2896.74s)]
*  flirting with stagflation. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2898.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2899.7799999999997s)]
*  That's when you do the nearly [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2900.2999999999997s)]
*  undoable of getting bad [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2901.66s)]
*  unemployment numbers and [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2902.8199999999997s)]
*  bad inflation numbers. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2904.14s)]
*  Which by the way, I mean, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2905.3799999999997s)]
*  you did the undoable in the markets [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2906.66s)]
*  by getting the stock market and [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2908.42s)]
*  the bond market to drop at [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2909.98s)]
*  the same time. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2911.2999999999997s)]
*  Which was previously thought [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2912.5s)]
*  unimaginable because they balance [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2913.9s)]
*  each other out. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2915.5s)]
*  When you take money out of one, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2916.18s)]
*  you usually put it in the other. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2917.42s)]
*  But people took it out of both [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2918.8199999999997s)]
*  markets because they're so [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2920.14s)]
*  worried about the instability that [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2921.5s)]
*  Trump is bringing. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2923.18s)]
*  And also, I mean, look, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2923.98s)]
*  this game of chicken with China [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2925.34s)]
*  has not really looked so [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2927.18s)]
*  great for Trump so far. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2928.58s)]
*  I think there was this assumption [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2930.22s)]
*  that President Xi in China was [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2932.14s)]
*  going to cave to Donald Trump's [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2933.94s)]
*  demands that has not happened yet. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2935.78s)]
*  It doesn't appear that he's going [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2937.42s)]
*  to bend at any point. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2939.1400000000003s)]
*  He could, you never know what [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2940.34s)]
*  the future holds, but things [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2941.6600000000003s)]
*  aren't looking good in regard to [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2943.0600000000004s)]
*  these negotiations with China. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2944.5800000000004s)]
*  Now with that in mind, today Trump [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2947.3s)]
*  posted this on Truth Social and [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2949.5800000000004s)]
*  that's what led to the freefall in [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2951.5800000000004s)]
*  the stock market. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2953.86s)]
*  He wrote, preemptive cuts in [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2955.42s)]
*  interest rates are being called for [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2957.3s)]
*  by many, meaning many want the Fed [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2959.7000000000003s)]
*  to lower interest rates. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2961.86s)]
*  With energy costs way down, which [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2963.8199999999997s)]
*  is true except for [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2965.8599999999997s)]
*  the case of California, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2966.7799999999997s)]
*  food prices, including Biden's egg [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2968.22s)]
*  disaster substantially- [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2970.3799999999997s)]
*  Come on. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2971.7799999999997s)]
*  I know, I know, it's ridiculous. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2972.4199999999996s)]
*  Look, we didn't hammer Trump over [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2974.3399999999997s)]
*  the egg prices because it was avian [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2976.62s)]
*  flu and he doesn't have control [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2978.8199999999997s)]
*  over that to the extent that [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2980.8199999999997s)]
*  people want to make it seem. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2982.58s)]
*  And as usual, we were fair and [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2984.3399999999997s)]
*  honest about Biden's inflation. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2985.7s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2987.3399999999997s)]
*  So was that all Biden? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2988.8999999999996s)]
*  No, in fact, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2990.7s)]
*  Biden handled it better than most [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2991.2599999999998s)]
*  of the rest of the world, partly [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2992.7s)]
*  because of Jerome Powell, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2993.8999999999996s)]
*  by the way. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2994.8199999999997s)]
*  And they worked in tandem, so [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2995.3799999999997s)]
*  we didn't hammer Trump over it [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2996.7799999999997s)]
*  because we're fair. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2998.22s)]
*  But then you want to blame it on [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=2999.22s)]
*  Biden, Biden nothing to do with [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3000.5s)]
*  the egg prices. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3002.1s)]
*  That makes you look like [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3003.18s)]
*  an ignoramus. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3004.02s)]
*  He says there's virtually no [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3005.14s)]
*  inflation right now, really? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3006.58s)]
*  Okay, there can be a slowing of [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3008.46s)]
*  the economy unless Mr. Too Late, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3010.3399999999997s)]
*  he's referring to Jerome Powell [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3012.54s)]
*  there, a major loser lowers [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3014.46s)]
*  interest rates now. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3016.18s)]
*  Come on. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3017.7s)]
*  Powell has always been too late, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3018.22s)]
*  except when it came to the election [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3020.2599999999998s)]
*  period when he lowered interest [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3022.34s)]
*  rates in order to help sleepy Joe [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3024.26s)]
*  Biden, later Kamala get elected. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3026.1400000000003s)]
*  How did that work out? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3028.02s)]
*  So Trump's post again followed [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3029.46s)]
*  an earlier post in which he called [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3031.42s)]
*  for Powell's termination. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3033.6200000000003s)]
*  And I want to just briefly talk [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3035.38s)]
*  about that because due to [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3037.1800000000003s)]
*  congressional legislation that was [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3038.7400000000002s)]
*  passed earlier, the Federal [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3041.1000000000004s)]
*  Reserve is a separate independent [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3043.06s)]
*  body and the President cannot fire [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3045.2200000000003s)]
*  the chair. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3047.46s)]
*  Now, I should note that in Trump's [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3048.6200000000003s)]
*  case, he was the one who tapped [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3050.74s)]
*  Jerome Powell to be head of [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3052.7s)]
*  the Federal Reserve. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3054.2999999999997s)]
*  But since he can't manipulate him [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3055.62s)]
*  like a nice little puppet, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3057.54s)]
*  Trump soured on him and wanted to [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3059.06s)]
*  fire him in his first term, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3060.98s)]
*  didn't succeed in that. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3062.46s)]
*  And now he's kind of bringing this [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3063.7799999999997s)]
*  issue back up. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3065.7s)]
*  But look, there is a Supreme Court [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3066.66s)]
*  case that could eventually lead to [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3069.06s)]
*  Trump having the ability to fire [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3071.62s)]
*  Jerome Powell. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3073.7799999999997s)]
*  So I want to get to that case and [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3074.66s)]
*  here's an explanation of it. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3076.54s)]
*  Tell me about the case in front of [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3079.14s)]
*  the Supreme Court that might change [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3080.62s)]
*  that. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3082.14s)]
*  Well, it involves the National [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3082.66s)]
*  Labor Relations Board, which is [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3083.98s)]
*  another one of those so-called [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3085.3799999999997s)]
*  independent federal agencies where [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3086.7s)]
*  Congress has specifically [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3088.4199999999996s)]
*  restricted the President from [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3089.8599999999997s)]
*  firing or removing members. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3091.3799999999997s)]
*  Trump did it anyway, so [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3093.02s)]
*  one of the members sued. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3094.74s)]
*  Now Trump argues that he has the [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3096.58s)]
*  power to do this under [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3098.22s)]
*  the Constitution, that these are [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3099.3399999999997s)]
*  agencies that perform executive [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3101.1s)]
*  functions. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3102.7s)]
*  He's the head of the executive [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3103.2599999999998s)]
*  branch and so [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3104.8999999999996s)]
*  Congress can't restrict him from [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3105.8199999999997s)]
*  these members. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3108.1800000000003s)]
*  And I will say looking back to [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3109.1400000000003s)]
*  cases in the past 15 years, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3110.9s)]
*  there has been some sympathy by [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3112.7000000000003s)]
*  some of the justices for [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3114.6600000000003s)]
*  those arguments. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3116.1800000000003s)]
*  Now, how does this case affect [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3118.02s)]
*  the Fed? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3119.86s)]
*  Well, it's a similarly structured [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3120.82s)]
*  agency, so there is real concern [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3122.7000000000003s)]
*  that if the court agrees to take up [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3124.6600000000003s)]
*  this case, and certainly if Trump [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3126.6200000000003s)]
*  wins, then that also could suggest [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3128.6600000000003s)]
*  that he could get rid of [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3130.7400000000002s)]
*  Jerome Powell as head of the Fed. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3132.02s)]
*  So a lot could really hinge on [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3134.42s)]
*  whether the Supreme Court hears [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3136.2200000000003s)]
*  that case and [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3138.26s)]
*  how they rule on that case. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3139.1800000000003s)]
*  It could, again, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3141.2200000000003s)]
*  negatively impact Jerome Powell's [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3142.4s)]
*  role as head of the Federal Reserve. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3144.48s)]
*  But nonetheless, Trump doesn't like [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3146.46s)]
*  independent government agencies. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3147.98s)]
*  He wants to have control over [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3149.78s)]
*  everything. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3150.82s)]
*  Yeah, this is a big problem. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3151.34s)]
*  So here the Supreme Court could go [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3153.9s)]
*  in the wrong direction. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3155.94s)]
*  And so we'll have to see how that [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3157.58s)]
*  plays out. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3159.34s)]
*  But the reason it'd be a huge [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3159.98s)]
*  problem is because every president, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3161.46s)]
*  this one is definitely not just [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3163.5s)]
*  Trump or the Republicans, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3165.3s)]
*  is going to want to pick a Fed [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3166.9s)]
*  chair that's going to stimulate [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3168.54s)]
*  the economy. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3170.34s)]
*  But the problem is when you [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3171.5s)]
*  stimulate it on your watch, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3172.5s)]
*  sometimes it blows up on [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3173.62s)]
*  the next guy, right? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3174.7s)]
*  So it's a deeply irresponsible but [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3176.1s)]
*  also nearly irresistible way of [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3178.3s)]
*  controlling the markets and [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3180.42s)]
*  the economy. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3182.26s)]
*  So a president is going to [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3183.22s)]
*  voluntarily not use that power to [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3184.54s)]
*  stimulate the economy, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3186.34s)]
*  even if it's overstimulating, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3187.76s)]
*  especially in his last two years, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3189.58s)]
*  when he's not likely to feel [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3191.58s)]
*  the brunt of it. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3193.02s)]
*  And he could pretend and [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3193.86s)]
*  his party can pretend all along, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3194.86s)]
*  when we were in charge, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3196.42s)]
*  everything was great. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3197.5s)]
*  So it's a really bad idea to go in [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3198.5s)]
*  this direction. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3201.22s)]
*  And lastly for me, Trump, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3203.62s)]
*  I mean, calling the head of [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3205.58s)]
*  the federal chair, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3207.66s)]
*  head of the Fed, a major loser. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3209.14s)]
*  Who does that? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3213.38s)]
*  I don't know when Maga is going to [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3214.5s)]
*  get tired of him being a child. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3216.06s)]
*  Maybe the answer is never, right? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3217.66s)]
*  Or independence that voted for [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3219.2599999999998s)]
*  Trump more importantly. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3220.82s)]
*  Come on guys, what is this? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3222.3s)]
*  What is like? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3223.82s)]
*  I don't mind, but look, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3225.3s)]
*  I don't like that he's attacking [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3226.6600000000003s)]
*  Jerome Powell for the reason he's [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3228.54s)]
*  attacking Jerome Powell. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3230.46s)]
*  And I've had my issues with [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3231.82s)]
*  monetary policy under Jerome [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3233.04s)]
*  Powell's leadership for sure. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3234.46s)]
*  But nonetheless, I don't care if he [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3235.94s)]
*  calls him a loser. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3237.26s)]
*  I get it, it seems childish [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3237.86s)]
*  compared to what- [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3239.26s)]
*  No, so I've said a million times, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3240.06s)]
*  I don't mind him doing the [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3241.9s)]
*  intimidation and the bullying. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3243.2200000000003s)]
*  That's part of politics and [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3245.1800000000003s)]
*  that's hardball. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3246.3s)]
*  And I've given him credit for that [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3247.6200000000003s)]
*  and you want to attack your [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3248.94s)]
*  political opponents, etc. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3250.02s)]
*  But when you call the head of [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3251.7s)]
*  the federal reserve major loser, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3253.42s)]
*  it's so stupid and childish. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3255.74s)]
*  And by the way, that's what makes [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3258.2599999999998s)]
*  the markets partly jittery, right? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3259.92s)]
*  because they're like, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3261.62s)]
*  the president's a freaking child. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3262.74s)]
*  And so whether you like it or not, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3264.86s)]
*  there's also tons of foreign [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3266.62s)]
*  investors in the stock market, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3268.1s)]
*  right? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3269.74s)]
*  And once they see that our [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3270.7s)]
*  president is a buffoon, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3272.1s)]
*  they get worried and [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3273.5s)]
*  they start withdrawing money from [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3274.7s)]
*  America. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3276.7s)]
*  So you can say, hey, I don't care [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3277.74s)]
*  about corporations, hey, you know [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3279.62s)]
*  me, I got 1,000 problems with [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3281.8599999999997s)]
*  corporations, right? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3283.58s)]
*  And the structure of the federal [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3285.1s)]
*  reserve has huge issues that we've [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3286.94s)]
*  talked about on other shows, right? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3288.92s)]
*  But when a president does this kind [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3291.06s)]
*  of third grade stuff, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3293.74s)]
*  it's unnerving. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3295.54s)]
*  Yeah, I get it, yeah, I agree. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3298.02s)]
*  So we'll see how this plays out, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atuk5YKAFBU&t=3300.98s)]
