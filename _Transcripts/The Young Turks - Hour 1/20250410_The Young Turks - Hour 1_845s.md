"HONG KONG ‚Äî The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%.

The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump‚Äôs 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries."

# Who Will Win The VICIOUS Trade War With China?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs)
*  China wants to make a deal. They just don't know how quite to go about it. It's one of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=0.0s)]
*  those things they don't know quite. They're proud people. And President Xi is a proud [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  man. I know him very well. And they don't know quite how to go about it, but they'll [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=10.4s)]
*  figure it out in the process of figuring it out. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  But they wanna make a deal. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=17.2s)]
*  Yeah, Trump in these tariffs, man. Okay, so even with Trump's controversial tariff reversal [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=19.6s)]
*  yesterday, the US and China are still locked in a back and forth battle of tariff escalation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=25.96s)]
*  We now have a tariff of 145% imposed on Chinese imports, while China has placed an 84% tariff [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=32.32s)]
*  on US goods. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=41.24s)]
*  How high will they go? The suspense is killing us and you gotta wonder who is gonna come [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  out on top of this trade war. Cenk, you wanna wager any bets? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=46.96s)]
*  Yeah, not us. So look, in a trade war this disastrous, no one wins. So I wanna talk about [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=51.279999999999994s)]
*  the scale of the potential disaster that still remains. And you could tell by how badly the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=59.72s)]
*  stock market did today, giving back some of the big gains from yesterday. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=65.84s)]
*  So people are still super worried. We're gonna explain why they're worried right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=70.24s)]
*  Okay, so here's what you need to know about the ongoing trade war, at least as it stands [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=74.52s)]
*  right now. First, whatever happens with the United States and China is going to have a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=79.58000000000001s)]
*  large impact on the rest of the world, as Cenk just alluded to. So none of this is happening [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  in any kind of vacuum. This is from the Wall Street Journal. They said combined, the two [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  countries account for more than 40% of the world economy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=94.18s)]
*  We import a lot more from China than they import from us. So China imports only about [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=98.34s)]
*  $160 billion a year in US goods, compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=104.62s)]
*  exports to us here in the United States. The US is dependent on China for 73% of its smartphones, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=111.54s)]
*  78% of its laptops, and 87% of its video game consoles. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=119.38000000000001s)]
*  So American consumers clearly have a lot to lose here. Even if we decided to build all [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=124.68s)]
*  of the manufacturing plants and hire all of the people to assemble all of these products [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=130.17999999999998s)]
*  here, we would still be paying a hell of a lot more for them compared to what we pay [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=134.73999999999998s)]
*  now. But China would suffer without us too. So since Trump's first term, the US share [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=139.14s)]
*  of Chinese exports dropped from 19.2% to 14.7%, but the loss of 15% of China's export market [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=145.1s)]
*  is still crippling. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=154.1s)]
*  The effects of the tariffs are already taking hold as well. Chinese sellers on e-commerce [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=156.04s)]
*  platforms are raising prices by up to 70% to US consumers, while others are preparing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  to exit the US market as punitive tariffs make trade unsustainable, according to one [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  of China's biggest e-commerce associations. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=173.22s)]
*  So it's worth noting that China has plenty of leverage to use against the US economy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  China could target the US farmers, for example, by banning certain imports like soybeans or [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=182.10000000000002s)]
*  poultry. Back during his first term when Trump also targeted China with tariffs, Trump [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=187.58s)]
*  had to subsidize the American farmers to help insulate them from the negative impacts of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  his trade war. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=197.46s)]
*  Also, China has pledged to import fewer Hollywood movies, which will cost American studios a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  significant chunk of box office money. Something else they could do, China is the fifth largest [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=204.3s)]
*  export market for American services such as finance, consulting, and law. The Chinese [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=209.72s)]
*  government could ban American companies from doing that kind of business in China. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=214.64s)]
*  And there's even more of where that came from. China could move faster to shed its large [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=220.5s)]
*  US treasury holdings, which would drive up the price of issuing debt and disrupt the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=225.72s)]
*  bond market. It could choose to target the US housing market by selling hundreds of billions [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  in mortgage-backed securities, which could push rates up. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=235.58s)]
*  China holds almost $800 billion in US debt. It is the second largest foreign holder after [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=239.74s)]
*  Japan. As for next steps, the Chinese government has stated that it still is open to negotiations [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=245.94s)]
*  with the United States, but they are not going to back down from a trade war with us. Both [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=252.18s)]
*  the United States and China are attempting to portray the other as the bad actor in these [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=257.02s)]
*  negotiations, even though we started it, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=262.48s)]
*  Cenk, we're still very much dealing with the fallout of all of last week and yesterday, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=265.68s)]
*  the market volatility, the reneging on the tariffs, the maybe insider trading. I know [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=271.32s)]
*  you guys are going to talk about that more in the second hour. But American consumers [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=275.92s)]
*  are worried about the price of eggs, which by the way, Trump says have gone down, but [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=279.6s)]
*  they haven't. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=283.92s)]
*  They've gone up, so he's just saying things now. How do you think the average American, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=284.92s)]
*  I'm curious, or maybe even the average Trump voter is understanding everything that's happening [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  right now? Or do you think they're just not understanding it? Because as you said, a lot [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=293.86s)]
*  of them are watching Fox News, and at this point, Fox News is just giving them propaganda. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=297.74s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think it's more complicated than that, including the substance. So first, just [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  to be fair, we didn't start the tariffs on China. China started tariffs on us initially, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=307.9s)]
*  right? Not during the Trump administration, but over a long period of time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=314.56s)]
*  So now having said that, what China's been doing is kind of like Israel's occupation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=318.8s)]
*  and what Trump did was like October 7th. So we could say, okay, Trump started it because [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=324.56s)]
*  he did this massive attack on China and the rest of the world. But these tariffs have [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=329.28s)]
*  been going on a long time and China's been doing a lot more than America has. So I give [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=335.32s)]
*  you that context. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=339.24s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. I give that context because I'm not saying that we shouldn't have done [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=340.7s)]
*  reciprocal tariffs on China. I think we should have, and I've been saying that for a long [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  time. But these are not reciprocal. China did not have 145% tariff on us. If you don't [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=349.82s)]
*  know anything about tariffs, tariff is just another word for tax. So that's putting 145% [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=357.54s)]
*  tax on goods that are coming into this country, and it's not on China. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  The Chinese companies will have troubles because of this. But remember, the companies that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  are importing it here are the ones paying it and passing it on to the consumers because [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  they have to. They don't have 146% profit margin. They've got to pass it on. And when [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=380.12s)]
*  they're passing it on when they shouldn't, we tell you right here on the show, we tell [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=386.36s)]
*  you about how it's price-gadgeting. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=388.94s)]
*  We pointed that out during the supply chain issues when the grocery stores were doing [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=390.58s)]
*  price-gadgeting. This would not be price-gadgeting. You can't absorb 145%. There is no profit [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=395.1s)]
*  margin that large. So, okay, so number one, not remotely reciprocal. These are maniacally [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=401.46s)]
*  high. They make no sense at all. They guarantee a trade war. There's no way around a trade [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=409.14s)]
*  war when you do something this gigantic and nuclear, basically economically. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=414.5s)]
*  Number two, our prices are going to go up. So when he was doing it against the whole [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=418.52s)]
*  world, which he withdrew about just a little while earlier, right? Just last day yesterday, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=423.36s)]
*  the prices were guaranteed to skyrocket across the board. Now, it's not going to be across [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=431.88s)]
*  the board, but it's still going to hit steel, aluminum, cars, which are separate tariffs [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=435.68s)]
*  on top of the Chinese tariffs. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=441.36s)]
*  Some pharmaceuticals, great drug prices weren't high enough. Now, there's some reasons for [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=443.68s)]
*  tariffs on pharmaceuticals, but again, the severity of this is out of control. Go back [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=447.94s)]
*  to China. There's tons of goods coming in, as Yaz explained from China. All the prices [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=452.46000000000004s)]
*  on those will skyrocket. And so people are going to start to feel the pain, and when [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=459.02000000000004s)]
*  they do, well, that's going to lead to my next point. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=463.02000000000004s)]
*  Look, I told you guys that these tariffs are so mental that there's no way that they were [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=466.22s)]
*  going to stay in place. I said it on The Young Turks. I said it on every show, and I said [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=471.54s)]
*  I said it on those shows here. I'm saying it on the record. There's no chance that these [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=475.29999999999995s)]
*  tariffs will remain. And of course, the right wingers I was opposed to were like, including [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=480.38s)]
*  Carrie Lake. Yeah, no way. They're going to rebuild the manufacturing base. They're going [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=484.53999999999996s)]
*  to last for the entirety of the Trump term, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Nonsense, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=488.65999999999997s)]
*  nonsense, nonsense. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=492.02s)]
*  We were right about that, because there are certain laws of physics and economics, and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=493.02s)]
*  so there's no way they could last. All right, now, will these China tariffs last at 145%? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=499.82s)]
*  No chance, 0% chance. So this one, last time on the overall tariffs, when he backpedaled [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=505.24s)]
*  yesterday, he got absolutely no concessions, nothing but a giant L, zero concessions, nothing [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=512.24s)]
*  in return, just oops, I screwed it up, okay? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=519.02s)]
*  On China, he has to get some concessions, otherwise it's too humiliating. So China's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=522.72s)]
*  going to have to do some face saving measures. And when they do, if they just tweak their [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=528.4s)]
*  original tariffs by a little bit, everyone on the right will go, order the deal, we do [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  it, right? So by the way, there is a way, like I said, you could do reciprocal on China, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  and you could bring down their tariffs in a more organized, strategic way, but that's [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=544.92s)]
*  not this. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  But overall, it won't last. But as long as it lasts, it'll do significant damage, not [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  just to the markets, but to the overall economy, as those companies start to fire people, because [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  they don't have enough resources, and as prices go up, and by the way, we already saw it today, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=562.14s)]
*  as the markets went down 1,100 points, when people realized, all the tariffs aren't gone, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=567.34s)]
*  he's still doing enormous, unprecedented, unheard of tariffs on our largest trading [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=574.18s)]
*  part. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=580.18s)]
*  Yeah, and it's very difficult for average people to exist with this kind of market uncertainty, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=581.18s)]
*  right? Because I think a lot of times, whenever things are being reported about these stories, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=587.26s)]
*  you hear about the stock market, you hear about bond markets, and you hear about other [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=592.1s)]
*  countries buying debt, things like that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  And the average person doesn't really understand how that's going to impact them or how it [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=598.16s)]
*  could impact them. There's so much going on with this administration right now, apart [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=602.16s)]
*  from all of this tariff drama, right? We're gonna talk about the budget in a minute, we're [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=608.12s)]
*  gonna talk about Medicare and Medicaid in a minute. There's so many things that are [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=612.52s)]
*  threatening so many different aspects of American life in this country, things that we have [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=616.2s)]
*  come to take for granted. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=620.78s)]
*  And to your point, you brought up something that I think is very important here, with [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=622.3s)]
*  a lot of different things going on with this administration. And it's the fact that, yes, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=628.14s)]
*  there are problems that need to be addressed and things that need to be fixed, right? There [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=632.18s)]
*  is government inefficiency that needs to be addressed, and it was being addressed, maybe [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=636.02s)]
*  it could have been addressed better. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=640.26s)]
*  But that's the thing, if things can be addressed better, then address them in a better way, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=641.8399999999999s)]
*  right? Be more strategic about it, don't just burn everything down, because what I was talking [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=646.24s)]
*  about earlier in the show, you have to be more responsible with the way that you choose [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=650.84s)]
*  to conduct business and with the plans you choose to execute whenever millions of wives [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=656.44s)]
*  are in danger, millions of wives are going to be affected by it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=661.12s)]
*  And this administration, they don't really have a plan for how to get people out of the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=665.2s)]
*  problems that they create for them. So we're gonna have to see what happens because they [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=669.76s)]
*  really don't have a plan. If they do have one, they're not telling us about it. Maybe [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=674.98s)]
*  that's the art of the deal and I just don't get it. Maybe we're not supposed to get it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=678.4200000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's part of Trump's art of the deal is that he just makes decisions whenever he [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=682.0600000000001s)]
*  feels like making them. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=687.14s)]
*  So maybe that's his secret, is he just goes off of his own intuition. It's very intuitive, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=688.62s)]
*  I heard. Any final thoughts before we move on to this next story? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=693.34s)]
*  Yeah, last couple thoughts here. Yeah, so first of all, he has no idea what he's doing, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=696.7s)]
*  period, period, period. He never has, never will. But there's an important point in here. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  Guys, China can actually do a nuclear option. If they go in that direction, they also hurt [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  themselves. But if they start selling off all their treasury bonds, they're the largest [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=711.92s)]
*  holder of treasury bonds in America. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=717.64s)]
*  That would do enormous damage to the dollar. That would do enormous damage to interest [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=721.7199999999999s)]
*  rates. That would do enormous damage to our economy, like untold damage. That's why I'm [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=728.18s)]
*  calling it the nuclear option. And in fact, when Japan began to do that last night or [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=732.66s)]
*  two nights ago, that's what caused the panic. They got Trump to turn around on the tariffs [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=737.78s)]
*  overall. So China's not going in that direction yet because if they do that, it would also [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=741.6999999999999s)]
*  devalue the value of the treasury bonds they hold. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=745.78s)]
*  And they hold nearly a trillion dollars worth. I think it's around 800 billion or so. So [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=751.54s)]
*  So that's the most important thing is we cannot have that nuclear option happen. I'm not even [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=757.0s)]
*  sure that Trump is aware of it because I'm not sure Trump's aware of anything. And so [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=764.0s)]
*  last time, at least there were some professionals in the room that he would listen to. These [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=767.5600000000001s)]
*  days, he's just flying off the handle and go, that my intuition, I know what's going [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=771.2s)]
*  on. He doesn't know anything. If you ask him about the bond market, he can begin to answer [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=775.6s)]
*  it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=780.4s)]
*  So is he aware that China has that nuclear option? I don't even know. I don't even know. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=781.4s)]
*  So look, last thing is, to your point, yes, I have seen some, not a lot, but some MAGA [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=787.02s)]
*  folks going, yeah, I don't get it. I don't understand what he's doing, but I hope he [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=792.58s)]
*  knows what he's doing. And I'm like, look, at least that's an honest answer. And then [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=798.34s)]
*  as we've of course reported here, some of the shows that supported Trump, not MAGA [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=802.26s)]
*  shows, not super right wing shows, but some bro shows and Dave Portnoy, etc. that definitely [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=806.74s)]
*  back Trump before the election are now saying, I don't know if we made a mistake. This guy [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=812.64s)]
*  is super volatile. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=818.52s)]
*  Doesn't seem to know what he's doing. Kind of told you. Not kind of, really told you, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=819.52s)]
*  but it's okay. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=825.6s)]
*  That is a little reassuring. I do appreciate that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=826.6s)]
*  Yeah. No, and look, I'll take anybody who comes to the right conclusion. So awesome, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=829.32s)]
*  love it. To Portnoy and others, way to keep an open mind. Every time you ring the bell [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=835.16s)]
*  below, an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=839.18s)]
*  live shows. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotrhaEEmTs&t=843.7s)]
