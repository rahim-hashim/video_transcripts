# Trump SCREWS Canadians Conservatives. Alex Jones CALLS OUT Trump?  - April 29, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU)
*  All right. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, the young Turks, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=58.64s)]
*  thank you for joining with you [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=59.7s)]
*  guys. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=61.14s)]
*  There's a poll on today's show that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=61.64s)]
*  is even for Trump shocking, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=64.4s)]
*  shocking. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=66.66s)]
*  So the degree to which Americans [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=68.16s)]
*  have become disillusioned with him [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=70.2s)]
*  is, well, almost immeasurable [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=72.32s)]
*  except for the fact that it is. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=74.24s)]
*  We measured it and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=76.12s)]
*  it's significant. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  The only people who seem to dislike [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=78.48s)]
*  it more are Canadians. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=80.08s)]
*  We're going to get to that in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=81.4s)]
*  a minute. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=82.56s)]
*  So and on top of that, we have one [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=83.12s)]
*  of the most, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=85.84s)]
*  I don't know if horrifying is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=86.92s)]
*  the right word, but [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=90.12s)]
*  it's close to the right word. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=92.16s)]
*  Piece of footage of a protester [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=94.76s)]
*  being attacked. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=97.36s)]
*  Should the anti-Semitism task force [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=99.84s)]
*  be on top of this? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=101.76s)]
*  Well, we're going to find out a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=103.44s)]
*  little bit later in the program. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=104.4s)]
*  Ro Khanna joins us a little bit [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  later in the program. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=106.64s)]
*  He's going to launch something [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=108.2s)]
*  bold and he has a great attitude [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=109.84s)]
*  towards the Pentagon, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=111.84s)]
*  and Elon Musk that I want to share [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=113.56s)]
*  with you that he did in hearings [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=115.76s)]
*  earlier today. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=117.64s)]
*  So he's going to be on the show in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  just a little bit. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=120.24s)]
*  And then on top of that, of course, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  for the members at the end of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=123.44s)]
*  the show, Operation Joy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=124.64s)]
*  And today in Operation Joy, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=126.44s)]
*  I'm going to talk about how we are [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=128.2s)]
*  magical creatures, okay? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=130.36s)]
*  So that's fun for everybody. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=132.64s)]
*  You'll enjoy the magic that we [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=133.84s)]
*  have. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=135.28s)]
*  So why? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=136.6s)]
*  Because we do a new show, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=137.88s)]
*  of course. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=139.36s)]
*  Okay, so Jordan Yule is not only at [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=140.68s)]
*  Rebel HQ, where he dominates and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=143.72000000000003s)]
*  shines, but he's also one of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  the hosts of the Insurgents podcast. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  And every once in a while will [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  battle me. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  And so that's fun, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=156.0s)]
*  that's fun for everybody. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  Love an exchange of ideas. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=160.4s)]
*  All right, so Jordan, on this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=161.72000000000003s)]
*  first one, we certainly agree. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=162.68s)]
*  Tell me about O Canada. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=164.12s)]
*  Well, take a look at this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=166.84s)]
*  I think who I voted for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=169.68s)]
*  would be the best to take care of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=172.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  Because Trump is, I'm sorry to say, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  an ass-and-and he shouldn't even [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=176.96s)]
*  be president of the United States. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=179.56s)]
*  But because he is, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=182.8s)]
*  we need a strong person so [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=184.08s)]
*  that we could stand strong. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=185.8s)]
*  Apparently, most Canadian voters [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=189.8s)]
*  agree with that iconic woman that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=192.0s)]
*  CNN interviewed yesterday. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=193.96s)]
*  Because Mark Carney and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  the Liberal Party came from behind [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  to defeat conservative Pierre [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=199.76s)]
*  Poliev in Canada's election [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=201.56s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=203.48s)]
*  Just months ago, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=204.84s)]
*  the Liberal Party was in terrible [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=205.82s)]
*  shape, and all signs pointed to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=207.6s)]
*  a conservative victory after Justin [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=209.4s)]
*  Trudeau's ouster. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=211.6s)]
*  You could see that here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=212.88s)]
*  The Liberals were 20 to 30 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=214.92s)]
*  percentage points behind in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=216.76s)]
*  surveys conducted in January, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=218.76s)]
*  before taking the lead in mid-March. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=220.92s)]
*  But thanks in large part to Trump's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=224.12s)]
*  attacks on Canada, including his [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=226.36s)]
*  threats to make Canada the 51st [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=228.56s)]
*  state and his tariff policies, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=230.8s)]
*  the Liberals managed to turn it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=233.08s)]
*  around. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=235.24s)]
*  Mark Carney, a former banker, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=236.72s)]
*  focused heavily on Donald Trump in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  his campaign and doubled down on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  that message of what he calls, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=242.36s)]
*  quote, American betrayal during [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=244.24s)]
*  his victory speech last night. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=246.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=248.36s)]
*  As I've been warning for months, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=250.88s)]
*  America wants our land, our [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=253.24s)]
*  resources, our water, our country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=255.24s)]
*  Never. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=258.04s)]
*  But these are not idle threats. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  President Trump is trying to break [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  us so that America can own us. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=269.92s)]
*  That will never, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=273.16s)]
*  that will never ever happen. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=274.36s)]
*  We are once again at one of those [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  hinge moments of history. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=278.32000000000005s)]
*  Our old relationship with [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=279.76s)]
*  the United States, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  a relationship based on steadily [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  increasing integration is over. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=285.36s)]
*  The system of open global trade [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=289.56s)]
*  anchored by the United States, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=291.92s)]
*  a system that Canada has relied on [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=294.36s)]
*  since the Second World War, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=296.88s)]
*  a system that well not perfect has [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=299.04s)]
*  helped deliver prosperity for [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=301.6s)]
*  a country for decades is over. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=303.96s)]
*  Despite the victory, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=309.56s)]
*  liberals still face major [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=310.86s)]
*  challenges because elections work [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=312.28s)]
*  a little different in Canada [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=314.32s)]
*  relative to the US. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=316.08s)]
*  Voters don't cast a ballot for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  a prime minister in the same way we [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  vote for a president, for instance. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  Instead, the party that wins the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=322.96s)]
*  most seats in parliament typically [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=324.32s)]
*  forms a government and its leader [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=325.96s)]
*  becomes the prime minister. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=327.55999999999995s)]
*  As of right now, with 99% of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  the results in, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  Carney's liberals are leading with [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  168 seats to conservatives 144. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=335.11999999999995s)]
*  But the liberals would need 172 to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=337.96s)]
*  capture a majority in parliament. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=340.55999999999995s)]

*  Trump an a-hole, right? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=545.44s)]
*  But what folks are saying online [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=548.0s)]
*  is even Trump's such a jerk that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=550.68s)]
*  he's even gotten the Canadians to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=553.52s)]
*  be impolite, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=556.52s)]
*  And they were very, very impolite [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=558.48s)]
*  to the right wing in Canada. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=559.92s)]
*  So this is what I keep [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=561.6s)]
*  emphasizing. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=562.4s)]
*  I don't know if anyone will care. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to get in, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=564.88s)]
*  but they decide to listen to sense. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=567.56s)]
*  But if you're a right winger, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=570.88s)]
*  you should be more mad at Trump. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=572.72s)]
*  How does it help you to destroy [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=575.6s)]

*  rational, insane, and sensible? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=581.48s)]
*  And the thing that helps the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=583.6s)]
*  economy and the thing that helps [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=585.16s)]
*  safety, the type of brand that they [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=586.96s)]

*  constitutions that you have. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=600.72s)]
*  So watch out if you elect a guy [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=603.56s)]

*  this doesn't help America and [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=718.88s)]

*  conservatives across the world or [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=723.2s)]

*  see how it turns out. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=728.0s)]
*  So, I mean, we originally named [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=729.32s)]
*  damage report for every morning, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  at least here on the West Coast. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=734.6s)]
*  John would get up in the first [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  Trump term and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=739.9200000000001s)]
*  tell you the damage report. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=740.96s)]

*  West Coast, 1 o'clock, East Coast, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=745.1600000000001s)]
*  when he's live on YouTube, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  and he'll tell you the damage [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=749.88s)]
*  report because yeah, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=751.92s)]
*  you're going to need a damage [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=753.4s)]
*  report every morning. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=755.2s)]
*  And at this point, conservatives [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=756.72s)]
*  are going to need one more than [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=758.72s)]
*  the rest of us. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=760.5s)]
*  What's so interesting to me about [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=761.44s)]
*  this, you talk about the global [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=764.2s)]
*  implications of Trump and his brand [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=766.5200000000001s)]
*  of kind of that hollow right wing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=769.0s)]
*  populism. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=771.24s)]
*  You've seen other world leaders try [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=771.96s)]
*  to emulate that style some to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=774.48s)]
*  some extent, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=776.6s)]
*  but you've seen the world leaders [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=777.72s)]
*  try to emulate that style. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  And so I think that's a great [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=783.2800000000001s)]
*  example of how the world is [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=785.12s)]
*  changing, and how the world is [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=787.0s)]
*  changing. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=789.24s)]
*  While some success or [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=790.0400000000001s)]
*  varying success, but others, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=791.36s)]
*  it's totally backfired for them. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=793.26s)]
*  And that's what's so interesting to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=795.96s)]
*  me here about Poliev. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=797.96s)]
*  He was down to even cribbing the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=799.2800000000001s)]
*  slogans, Canada first, and for [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=801.2s)]
*  a while it was working. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=803.26s)]
*  But when reminded of what a Trump [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=804.76s)]
*  administration looks like, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=806.88s)]
*  maybe it's recency bias, but [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=808.84s)]
*  also people just don't have long [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=810.6800000000001s)]
*  term memories, short attention [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=812.76s)]
*  spans, he was poised again to be [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=814.64s)]
*  prime minister over the past couple [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=816.72s)]
*  of years. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=819.02s)]
*  And then you just look at that data [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=819.4399999999999s)]
*  that we showed you the top [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=821.06s)]
*  of the story, it's remarkable. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=822.18s)]
*  Part of that also seems to be NDP [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=824.1s)]
*  or potential NDP voters coalescing [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=826.42s)]
*  behind liberals just to make sure [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=828.9s)]
*  that conservatives cannot form [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=831.1s)]
*  a government there. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=833.06s)]
*  Just to ensure that Poliev is not [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=834.38s)]
*  their prime minister. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=836.54s)]
*  And Jagmeet Singh has led NDP, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=838.3s)]
*  which is more like the left wing [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=840.8199999999999s)]
*  party in Canada, despite there are [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=843.3s)]
*  many criticisms from progressives [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=845.9s)]
*  and lefties in Canada about NDP. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=848.62s)]
*  But still, he's resigning now as [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=851.3399999999999s)]

*  they lost several seats. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=857.4599999999999s)]
*  Kind of feel bad for him, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=859.06s)]
*  seems like a little bit of [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=860.62s)]
*  a wrong place at the wrong time [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=862.14s)]

*  coalesce around these liberal [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=865.66s)]
*  candidates to make sure that Poliev [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=867.5799999999999s)]
*  remained out of the prime minister's [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=869.8199999999999s)]
*  seat. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=872.4599999999999s)]
*  But still, despite that, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=873.3s)]
*  Trump is relishing in the fact that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=875.14s)]

*  And everybody said you're going to [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1005.1s)]
*  cannibalize those casinos. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1006.22s)]
*  He's like, I know. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1007.22s)]
*  One of his executives literally [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1008.3000000000001s)]
*  said it's because he liked to see [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1010.02s)]
*  his name all over the city. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1011.74s)]
*  Trump, Trump, Trump, right? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1013.54s)]
*  And then you know what happened? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1015.62s)]
*  Bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1016.58s)]
*  And so that's what he's doing to [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1018.5s)]
*  his allies now. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1019.82s)]
*  They're all closed down for [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1021.3000000000001s)]
*  business because this buffoon got [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1022.6999999999999s)]
*  involved. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1024.62s)]
*  So, hey, keep going that way. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1025.78s)]
*  Again, I'm obsessed with the woman [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1028.18s)]
*  that we showed you in the beginning. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1029.86s)]
*  She's like the new queen of Canada, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1031.6599999999999s)]
*  slay queen, okay? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1033.58s)]
*  So, but the real slayer here, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1034.86s)]
*  the conservative slayer, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1037.7s)]
*  is Donald J Trump. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1040.1399999999999s)]
*  So everybody's in their own bubbles [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1042.58s)]
*  and you could all pretend anything [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1044.58s)]
*  you like, but elections are real [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1046.42s)]
*  and they have consequences. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1048.22s)]
*  The thing I'm worried about is what [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1049.82s)]
*  we asked about in the poll on [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1051.6599999999999s)]
*  the live chat. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1053.06s)]

*  And look, my instinct and great [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1057.62s)]
*  desire is that yes, it can be [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1059.6999999999998s)]

*  I mean, come on. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1064.5s)]
*  I mean, I can't get over it because [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1065.9799999999998s)]
*  how do you piss off Canada? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1068.3799999999999s)]

*  hostile, and somehow you managed to [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1078.26s)]
*  get them to all hate you. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1080.8200000000002s)]

*  I used to speak years ago that one [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1277.26s)]

*  People thought I was exaggerating. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1281.78s)]

*  The defense budget is now going to [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1284.5800000000002s)]

*  no vote on this committee. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1290.5s)]
*  People are wondering what is [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1292.62s)]
*  happening when you can't get [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1294.34s)]
*  the world's richest person to get [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1296.18s)]

*  accountable. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1300.1s)]
*  So, Mr. Chairman, my view is that [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1301.8999999999999s)]
*  if Doge has any seriousness, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1304.74s)]
*  if they have any sense of actually [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1307.18s)]
*  cutting waste, fraud, and abuse, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1309.74s)]
*  they would look at the Pentagon [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1312.34s)]
*  budget and bring it down before we [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1314.34s)]
*  add another $150 billion to that [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1316.46s)]
*  budget. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1318.58s)]
*  All right, that's what I like to [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1320.3s)]
*  see in Congress. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1321.94s)]
*  All right, Representative Khanna, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1322.98s)]
*  tell us about that hearing. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1324.98s)]
*  What was it about? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1326.7s)]
*  And I said on X that they're going [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1327.98s)]
*  to add $150 billion to the Pentagon. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1330.82s)]
*  And this was now a little back one [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1335.8600000000001s)]
*  or two weeks ago. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1338.18s)]
*  And Grok was like, no, I think [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1339.9s)]
*  maybe they're going to add like [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1341.42s)]
*  100 billion. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1342.98s)]
*  But it sounds like I was more right [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1343.66s)]
*  than Grok, I don't know. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1345.26s)]

*  You're right. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1348.18s)]
*  I mean, look, they were supposed to [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1348.94s)]
*  cut the Pentagon budget. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1351.14s)]
*  It's about 860 billion. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1352.78s)]
*  They were talking about cuts, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1355.38s)]
*  even Hegseth was saying, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1356.9s)]
*  let's do 8% cuts. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1358.14s)]

*  hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1361.46s)]
*  And it turns out instead of [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1364.18s)]
*  cutting, they're actually adding [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1365.3400000000001s)]
*  $150 billion. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1366.94s)]
*  First time in American history that [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1367.94s)]

*  I mean, when Musk first got there, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1385.3799999999999s)]
*  he was talking about taking on [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1387.34s)]

*  They said we can't have this kind [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1435.0600000000002s)]
*  of deficit spending and [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1437.02s)]

*  they know is defense. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1439.74s)]
*  It's the biggest item in [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1440.98s)]
*  discretionary spending. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1441.94s)]
*  And so they insisted they were [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1443.38s)]
*  going to cut it, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1445.0600000000002s)]
*  Elon insisted he was going to cut [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1445.98s)]
*  it, Laura Ingraham talked about [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1447.9s)]
*  cuts, Donald Trump on the campaign [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1449.9s)]
*  trail talked about cuts. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1451.98s)]
*  But when it comes to shove, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1453.42s)]
*  they're increasing it more than [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1455.26s)]
*  any modern president. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1457.46s)]
*  By the way, also Tim Pool, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1459.5800000000002s)]
*  Patrick, but David, so [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1461.22s)]
*  many of the right wing hosts said, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1462.42s)]
*  yeah, cut, cut, cut. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1464.26s)]
*  And now they're adding 150 [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1465.8600000000001s)]
*  billions. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1467.42s)]
*  So I love that you're holding them [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1468.18s)]
*  accountable there. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1470.0600000000002s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1471.46s)]
*  populism because there's your [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1473.54s)]
*  populist, Trump claims to be [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1475.78s)]
*  a populist, although it's an ironic [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1478.02s)]
*  kind of populism when you think [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1480.66s)]
*  corporate tax cuts are populist. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1482.8600000000001s)]
*  Pretty sure that's not in any [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1485.78s)]
*  definition. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1487.5s)]
*  But you talk about rebuilding [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1489.26s)]
*  manufacturing in America, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1490.66s)]

*  So what does that mean to you? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1494.8200000000002s)]
*  And can you do that kind of [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1496.8200000000002s)]
*  populism without having the weirdo [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1498.46s)]
*  radical authoritarian things that [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1500.78s)]
*  Trump attaches to it? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1503.18s)]
*  Absolutely, populism is pretty [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1507.1000000000001s)]
*  simple, it means making sure that [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1509.14s)]
*  we have an agenda that helps people [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1511.5s)]
*  who are working in middle class, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1513.78s)]
*  paid family leave, child care, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1515.94s)]
*  that is $10 a day. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1518.18s)]
*  Medicare for all, some kind of [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1519.5s)]
*  health care that from the day [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1521.3s)]

*  a house that Wall Street isn't [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1524.62s)]
*  buying up your homes. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1526.34s)]
*  I mean, these are a lot of things [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1527.58s)]
*  that rebellion pack is talking about, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1529.1s)]
*  making sure billionaires don't get [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1530.78s)]
*  to decide your elections, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1532.38s)]
*  that you abolish super PACs, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1533.74s)]
*  get the money out of politics. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1535.18s)]
*  But it also means that we [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1537.06s)]
*  understand a modern economy, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1538.1s)]
*  that to build modern factories, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1539.42s)]
*  you're going to need federal [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1540.82s)]
*  financing, you're going to need to [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1541.94s)]
*  develop a federal workforce. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1543.26s)]
*  You're going to need the government [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1544.5s)]
*  to help buy, to create a stable [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1546.5s)]
*  demand signal. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1548.26s)]
*  And what the Democratic Party [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1550.62s)]
*  should be is running on what I [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1552.18s)]
*  call a new economic patriotism, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1553.78s)]
*  a real economic vision of how we're [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1555.66s)]
*  going to build new industry, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1557.66s)]
*  build new economic jobs. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1559.46s)]
*  And an anti-corruption agenda as [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1561.22s)]
*  a lot of the rebellion PAC has, and [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1563.46s)]
*  a lot of a working class agenda, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1565.78s)]
*  helping improve life for [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1567.98s)]
*  ordinary Americans, that's populism. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1569.62s)]
*  It's not just bluster. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1572.58s)]
*  Yeah, and it's not just opposing [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1574.98s)]
*  Trump for opposition's sake. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1577.26s)]
*  And it's not just, hey, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1579.34s)]
*  he's a bad guy. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1580.5s)]
*  It's something constructive. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1581.78s)]
*  It's something that you're [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1583.06s)]
*  offering the country. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1584.22s)]
*  And so, how about taking it to [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1585.3s)]
*  other members in Congress? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1588.14s)]
*  So you mentioned some of the [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1591.7s)]
*  pillars of populism, and [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1594.02s)]
*  you mentioned in the context of [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1595.98s)]
*  rebellion PAC, etc. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1598.3799999999999s)]
*  And so there's the populist plank. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1600.22s)]
*  And those are the things that you [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1601.78s)]
*  talked about there, anti-war, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1603.46s)]
*  money out of politics, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1605.22s)]
*  lower drug prices, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1606.7s)]
*  housing prices, etc. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1607.7s)]
*  Can you take that to other members [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1609.1399999999999s)]
*  in the House and see if we can get [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1611.82s)]
*  that to be accepted by the majority [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1614.18s)]
*  of the Democratic Party? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1616.54s)]
*  I am, I'm going to be taking [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1618.34s)]
*  those six points. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1620.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, lower drug prices are [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1621.5s)]
*  central to helping relieve Americans [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1623.3799999999999s)]
*  and Medicare plus. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1625.78s)]
*  I heard Dr. Oz on Chris Cuomo [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1627.42s)]
*  yesterday telling him that all [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1629.18s)]
*  the things he was going to do to [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1630.86s)]
*  cut Medicare fraud, but [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1632.54s)]
*  then he didn't mention that he [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1633.94s)]
*  was going to take on prescription [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1635.7s)]
*  drugs, that's the biggest part [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1637.26s)]
*  of the cost. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1638.8200000000002s)]
*  He didn't mention they would take [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1639.46s)]
*  on Medicare Advantage that is [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1641.1000000000001s)]
*  having their patients seem sicker [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1642.5s)]
*  than they are. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1644.18s)]
*  He didn't mention that he was going [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1644.9s)]
*  to take on the hospitals that are [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1646.5800000000002s)]
*  charging three times as much for [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1648.18s)]
*  facility fees than if you go and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1649.9s)]
*  get the same procedure at a clinic. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1651.5800000000002s)]
*  And so these policy planks of [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1653.7s)]
*  negotiating on prescription drugs [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1655.7s)]
*  are popular, they actually save [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1658.1000000000001s)]
*  costs and the whole Democratic [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1660.22s)]
*  caucus should be on them. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1662.26s)]
*  But I've already started to reach [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1663.98s)]
*  some of the members to see how many [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1665.8999999999999s)]
*  populace we can really get. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1667.62s)]
*  All right, terrific. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1670.06s)]
*  And so, when they add to the [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1671.06s)]
*  Pentagon instead of cutting it, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1673.02s)]
*  it puts a lie to their populism. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1675.46s)]
*  And they're aiding and [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1678.5s)]
*  abetting pork barrel politics in [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1679.86s)]
*  the Defense Department, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1681.86s)]
*  which is where most of it is. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1683.34s)]
*  But your point about Medicare and [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1684.98s)]
*  the drug prices puts a bigger lie [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1687.02s)]
*  to their fake populism. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1689.06s)]
*  Because what kind of populists say, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1691.1799999999998s)]
*  we should let drug companies and [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1693.6599999999999s)]
*  big pharma set prices for you. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1696.06s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1699.34s)]
*  we shouldn't have a free market. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1700.02s)]

*  It's a populism that is based on [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1836.78s)]

*  there is a lot of grievance and [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1841.5s)]

*  it's not based on solutions. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1845.2s)]
*  And what I think the Democrats have [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1847.1399999999999s)]
*  to offer is a constructive [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1848.98s)]

*  the lives of people. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1853.22s)]
*  See, that's a thing you could [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1855.58s)]
*  build off of. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1856.94s)]
*  It's one thing to say the other guy [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1857.82s)]
*  is bad, which he most certainly is. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1859.22s)]
*  It's another thing to say, hey, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1861.06s)]

*  We could do it the right way. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1866.06s)]
*  So along those lines, I mean, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1867.5s)]
*  again, you show leadership. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1868.8999999999999s)]
*  You're the first to join [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1870.3799999999999s)]
*  a rebellion pack. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1871.6599999999999s)]
*  And now we've got other candidates [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1872.46s)]
*  running in some purple and [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1874.58s)]
*  red districts. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1876.26s)]
*  So can you go to places like North [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1877.5s)]
*  Carolina and other places where [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1879.62s)]
*  there's purple and red districts? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1881.86s)]

*  fight for real economic populism [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1887.26s)]
*  and bringing back the Democratic [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1890.1399999999999s)]
*  party to its roots all [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1892.8999999999999s)]

*  Three of them in rural California, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1901.06s)]
*  Bakersfield, Norco, and also [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1904.18s)]
*  Anaheim, and then one in rural [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1906.98s)]
*  Nebraska, one in New Jersey. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1909.58s)]
*  And there are hundreds, in some [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1912.02s)]
*  cases thousands of people showing [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1913.7s)]

*  And I'm going to continue to do it [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1917.1s)]
*  and I'm excited about some of [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1918.86s)]
*  the rebellion pack candidates who [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1920.46s)]

*  First one on the board. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1934.18s)]
*  I've seen a lot of folks [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1935.54s)]

*  this context. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=1941.5s)]

*  Yank, there's some horrifying [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2035.38s)]
*  footage out of New York. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2036.7s)]
*  New York police are now [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2039.54s)]

*  Gavir's Brooklyn appearance. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2054.02s)]
*  But here's the kicker. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2056.1s)]
*  She wasn't even protesting. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2057.74s)]
*  She was just an innocent bystander [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2059.5s)]
*  caught in the crossfire. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2061.62s)]
*  Yank, just based on this footage [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2063.7799999999997s)]
*  alone, what's your initial [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2065.7s)]
*  thoughts here? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2067.38s)]
*  Well, I'm sure they're getting [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2068.5s)]
*  an anti something or [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2071.1s)]
*  other task force ready to combat [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2072.82s)]
*  this because that's worse than [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2075.46s)]
*  anything we saw on a college [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2078.7s)]
*  campus where they surround a person [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2080.58s)]
*  they throw things at her. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2083.14s)]
*  And as Jordan's going to tell you [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2084.98s)]
*  the details in a second threatening [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2086.9s)]
*  to rape her, etc. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2089.22s)]
*  So will there be congressional [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2090.58s)]
*  hearings? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2092.86s)]
*  Will any of the people there be [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2093.54s)]
*  investigated to find out if there [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2095.34s)]
*  are citizens or not? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2097.34s)]
*  Are they on a visa? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2098.7s)]
*  Are they resident aliens? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2099.82s)]
*  Should we arrest and deport them? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2100.98s)]
*  No, none of that will happen. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2103.38s)]
*  None of that will happen. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2104.54s)]
*  In fact, as this story unwinds, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2106.98s)]
*  you're going to see that some of [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2109.2200000000003s)]
*  the cops saw all of this happening [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2111.38s)]
*  and went, yeah, but [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2113.78s)]
*  they have privilege and you don't. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2115.2200000000003s)]
*  So you're going to have to sit [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2117.54s)]
*  there and take it. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2118.7000000000003s)]
*  And after we go through this story, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2119.58s)]
*  I'm going to tell you an amazing [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2121.38s)]
*  story where I had something similar [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2122.98s)]
*  happen to me in a very different [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2124.82s)]
*  context. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2126.42s)]
*  So I know exactly what that woman [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2128.02s)]
*  went through and the terror that [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2129.5s)]
*  happens when you face a mob like [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2130.98s)]
*  that. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2132.38s)]
*  We'll get to all that. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2133.1s)]
*  But Jordan, tell us more about [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2133.78s)]
*  this. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2134.82s)]
*  Yeah, let's get back into some of [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2136.34s)]
*  these details. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2137.94s)]
*  The incident last Thursday occurred [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2138.82s)]
*  after pro-Palestinian activists [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2140.9s)]
*  had reportedly gathered to [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2142.7400000000002s)]

*  You want someone to bend you over [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2186.86s)]

*  and she was in the neighborhood. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2213.98s)]
*  And she was hearing helicopters. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2216.18s)]
*  There were no protesters left by [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2217.7799999999997s)]
*  the time I got there, but [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2219.66s)]
*  there were just like tons, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2221.18s)]
*  like hundreds of Orthodox Jewish [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2222.9s)]

*  on the sidewalk, she said. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2226.54s)]
*  Then some people near me began [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2229.46s)]

*  the protests that night. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2315.22s)]
*  A police spokesperson told AP News [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2316.98s)]
*  that so far one person has been [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2318.86s)]

*  none of this is acceptable. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2343.1400000000003s)]
*  In fact, it is despicable. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2345.0200000000004s)]
*  New York City will always be [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2347.7000000000003s)]
*  a place where people can peacefully [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2349.5s)]
*  protest, but we will not tolerate [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2351.86s)]

*  you've made a response to that. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2361.66s)]
*  Is this a place where people can [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2363.42s)]
*  protest peacefully and [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2364.8599999999997s)]
*  what do you make of this situation [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2365.9s)]
*  here? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2367.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so first off, I'm going to [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2367.8599999999997s)]
*  say the same thing that I say when [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2369.7799999999997s)]
*  it is Muslim fundamentalists that [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2371.66s)]
*  do anything wrong, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2373.7s)]
*  right wing fundamentalists do [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2374.7799999999997s)]
*  anything wrong. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2376.42s)]
*  Do not judge all Orthodox Jews by [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2377.38s)]
*  the actions of these few folks. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2379.06s)]
*  And the synagogue involved there [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2381.06s)]
*  actually condemn what happened. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2382.74s)]
*  So that's good, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2384.3399999999997s)]
*  we appreciate that and [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2385.42s)]
*  that's cooler heads prevailing. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2386.9s)]
*  Now, should there be consequences [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2389.2999999999997s)]
*  especially for the person who [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2391.5800000000004s)]
*  threw the object at her and [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2393.2200000000003s)]
*  then people who threatened to rape [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2394.5800000000004s)]
*  her, etc, of course they should. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2396.3s)]
*  Will there be legal consequences [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2398.1400000000003s)]
*  for that? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2399.86s)]
*  So why do I say maybe, maybe not? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2400.42s)]
*  Because this is so egregious even [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2403.1800000000003s)]
*  Eric Adams, who will do anything for [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2405.3s)]

*  and it shouldn't happen. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2409.98s)]
*  So and look, to be fair, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2411.98s)]
*  I have no idea if any member of [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2413.7000000000003s)]

*  But so, but like he's not a guy [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2421.26s)]
*  that normally is animated about [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2423.38s)]
*  this, he's usually animated about [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2425.82s)]
*  if you ever criticize Israel. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2428.42s)]
*  So I'm just taking his track record [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2430.3s)]
*  on this, okay? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2432.38s)]

*  think that there would be action [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2435.42s)]

*  A Colombian, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2501.8999999999996s)]
*  somebody ran over protesters. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2502.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's so that's pretty bad. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2505.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was pro-Israeli guy who [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2507.02s)]
*  did that. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2508.34s)]
*  There's another pro-Israeli guy who [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2508.98s)]
*  ran over somebody or [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2511.3s)]
*  shot at someone in Miami because [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2512.54s)]
*  they thought he was a Palestinian. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2514.58s)]
*  It turns out they were Israeli or [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2516.74s)]
*  they were Jewish. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2518.74s)]
*  I forget if it was Israeli or [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2520.02s)]
*  Jewish that they shot at. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2521.5s)]
*  And so I think it was [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2523.5s)]
*  an Israeli family. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2524.42s)]
*  So there's and then at UCLA, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2525.58s)]
*  massive violence and [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2527.62s)]
*  which side was it? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2529.14s)]
*  The pro-Israeli side. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2530.46s)]
*  So now you have seen with your own [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2532.1s)]
*  eyes we've shown you the video in [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2534.22s)]
*  another case we reported several [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2536.8199999999997s)]
*  different times where you see [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2539.02s)]
*  the pro-Israeli side do significant [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2541.06s)]
*  violence, harassment, etc. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2543.9s)]
*  And yet no congressional hearings, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2546.7799999999997s)]
*  no universities being shut down, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2548.8199999999997s)]
*  no one being kidnapped off [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2550.62s)]
*  the streets. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2552.14s)]
*  And by the way, would I want it to [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2552.98s)]
*  be done in reverse? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2554.74s)]
*  That if you criticize Palestine or [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2556.2999999999997s)]
*  you applaud Israel, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2558.5s)]
*  that you should be kidnapped by [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2559.9s)]
*  mass men representing [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2561.74s)]
*  the American government. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2563.02s)]
*  And arrested and deported and [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2564.7s)]
*  put into prisons in Louisiana, etc. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2566.9s)]
*  Of course not, of course not. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2569.58s)]
*  We need to have freedom of speech [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2571.9s)]
*  in this country. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2573.42s)]
*  We need to be able to believe [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2574.26s)]
*  anything we want and not be harassed [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2575.74s)]
*  by either the government or [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2577.7s)]
*  mobs of angry individuals. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2579.38s)]
*  So I hope that they take action. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2582.02s)]
*  Do I have strong belief that they [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2584.18s)]
*  will? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2586.22s)]
*  No, I don't have a strong belief [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2587.3s)]
*  that they will. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2588.86s)]
*  And so, look, I'll tell you this [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2589.7s)]
*  story Jordan that happened to me. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2591.7s)]
*  And you don't need this story to be [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2594.22s)]
*  outraged by it, right? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2596.74s)]
*  But I just happened to have [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2599.14s)]
*  a personal situation that was very [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2600.62s)]
*  similar to this. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2602.58s)]
*  So I had enormous sympathy and [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2603.3799999999997s)]
*  empathy for her. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2605.2599999999998s)]
*  So when I was down in Miami, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2606.4599999999996s)]
*  Elian Gonzalez was there at the time, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2608.7s)]
*  if you remember around 2000, right? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2611.7s)]
*  He's a little boy from Cuba, and [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2614.3399999999997s)]
*  his dad was in Cuba and [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2616.14s)]
*  wanted him back. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2617.2999999999997s)]
*  His mom had died coming over here. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2618.18s)]
*  And all of Little Havana was folks [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2620.2599999999998s)]
*  who had come over from Cuba [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2622.7s)]
*  originally, and [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2624.38s)]
*  they were all around his house. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2625.34s)]
*  And I thought that there was [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2627.58s)]
*  a counter protest to send Elian [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2628.82s)]
*  home. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2630.42s)]
*  And even though back then I was [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2630.94s)]
*  a Republican, I thought, well, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2632.22s)]
*  that doesn't make sense, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2633.58s)]
*  his dad wants him back home. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2634.54s)]
*  We gotta send him back home, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2635.66s)]
*  can't just keep him from his dad. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2636.94s)]
*  So I go down there thinking that [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2638.82s)]
*  there was a counter protest. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2640.06s)]
*  There was no counter protest, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2641.46s)]
*  I was the only one, okay? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2642.58s)]
*  And what happened was an angry mob [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2644.1s)]
*  just like that of about at least [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2646.9s)]
*  100 people attacked me at once. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2649.38s)]
*  And there's nothing quite as [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2651.94s)]
*  terrifying as that, right? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2653.86s)]
*  For some of you who are members and [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2656.42s)]
*  you've heard me tell the story in [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2658.02s)]
*  bonus episodes of Saturday before, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2659.62s)]
*  there's a part of the story that's [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2661.38s)]
*  funny that didn't happen here, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2662.98s)]
*  right? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2664.34s)]
*  But actually, if you're a woman or [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2664.86s)]
*  anyone really, you might not have [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2666.94s)]
*  found it funny if you were in [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2669.02s)]
*  my situation. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2670.7000000000003s)]
*  So they attacked me, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2671.78s)]
*  they ripped my sign, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2672.98s)]
*  they started ripping my shirt. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2674.2200000000003s)]
*  And just like her, one cop showed [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2675.7400000000002s)]
*  up and started escorting me to [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2677.82s)]
*  a car, and another cop, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2679.9s)]
*  then came in and said, hey, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2681.8199999999997s)]
*  he didn't do anything wrong, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2683.18s)]
*  we shouldn't put him in the police [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2684.38s)]
*  car, it'll look like he's getting [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2685.7s)]
*  arrested. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2687.1s)]
*  And me and the cop were like, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2687.98s)]
*  let's go, because at that point, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2689.2999999999997s)]
*  people are punching me in the back [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2691.06s)]
*  of the head, kicking me, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2692.7799999999997s)]
*  punching me. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2694.02s)]
*  And then the comical part was some [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2694.7799999999997s)]
*  guy kept pinching me in the butt [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2696.58s)]
*  from behind, it was so crazy. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2698.2599999999998s)]
*  It was a madhouse, right? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2699.8199999999997s)]
*  But before that crazy part, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2701.7s)]
*  which was to me slightly amusing, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2703.38s)]
*  probably wouldn't be to anyone [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2705.42s)]
*  else, I was afraid for my life, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2707.2999999999997s)]
*  right? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2709.38s)]
*  And so when I think about her, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2710.78s)]
*  a woman in that situation, and [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2712.5s)]
*  all of a sudden you've got this [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2714.2200000000003s)]
*  angry mob coming up on her and [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2715.9s)]
*  attacking her and threatening to [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2717.6200000000003s)]
*  rape her, my God, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2719.5800000000004s)]
*  the terror she must have had. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2720.82s)]
*  And what are we fighting? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2722.98s)]
*  We're fighting against terrorism, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2725.38s)]
*  right? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2726.82s)]
*  And that was nothing but [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2727.94s)]
*  terror there. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2729.1400000000003s)]
*  Jordan, imagine not only being in [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2730.2200000000003s)]
*  that situation yourself, but [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2732.3s)]
*  imagine it's someone you love and [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2734.26s)]
*  care for, a woman in your life, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2736.5s)]
*  in a situation like that, and [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2738.7799999999997s)]
*  you saw the video later, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2740.9399999999996s)]
*  how enraged would you be? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2742.7s)]
*  I would lose my mind, and [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2746.5s)]
*  I would be furious with the police [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2748.1s)]
*  who stood idly by, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2750.3399999999997s)]
*  as this woman talked about. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2751.58s)]
*  We know, unfortunately, that [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2754.18s)]
*  the NYPD is fully capable of [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2756.8999999999996s)]
*  responding if there are crowds or [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2759.22s)]
*  protests or demonstrators, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2761.8599999999997s)]
*  whatever, on an issue that they [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2764.4199999999996s)]
*  prove up that is powerless. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2766.82s)]
*  I mean, here we're seeing [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2769.26s)]
*  a politically powerful movement and [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2770.98s)]
*  ideology, just at the onset of this [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2773.7400000000002s)]
*  incident, the police turned a blind [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2776.3s)]
*  eye to it, but I think back to 2020 [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2779.02s)]
*  and the George Floyd uprising, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2781.7400000000002s)]
*  how violent NYPD was. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2784.1400000000003s)]
*  Not saying the solution should have [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2785.7000000000003s)]
*  been violence, but if they want to, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2788.5800000000004s)]
*  they will break up groups of people. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2791.42s)]
*  So let's say that the police [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2794.1800000000003s)]
*  is not a political power, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2796.62s)]
*  so we know they can do that. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2798.62s)]
*  But when it comes to a group of [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2800.98s)]
*  people who have political power, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2802.66s)]
*  who are not representing [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2804.66s)]
*  the marginalized here, it seems [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2806.14s)]
*  like time and time again, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2808.1s)]
*  they turn a blind eye to it. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2809.5s)]
*  That's the role of police in [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2811.14s)]
*  modern society. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2812.66s)]
*  It is protecting powerful interests, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2813.7s)]
*  that's it. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2816.14s)]
*  They're not out there to protect and [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2816.8199999999997s)]
*  serve you, the individual, and [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2818.74s)]
*  you see that here. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2820.62s)]
*  Eventually, luckily, he finally [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2821.66s)]
*  intervened and got her there [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2823.7799999999997s)]
*  and he had to endure any of that. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2825.62s)]
*  It's unfortunate that you were in [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2827.7s)]
*  that circumstance in the early [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2829.46s)]
*  2000s, it's unfortunate that she [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2830.94s)]
*  was in that circumstance. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2832.74s)]
*  And sadly, there are many [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2834.22s)]
*  instances where police will just [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2835.7s)]
*  turn a blind eye to other similar [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2837.38s)]
*  circumstances and [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2839.14s)]
*  that should not be the case. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2840.06s)]
*  Yeah, last two things here. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2841.74s)]
*  The guy threw a cone at her and [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2843.7s)]
*  the first shot guy that Kyle [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2846.02s)]
*  Rittenhouse shot had thrown [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2848.5s)]
*  a plastic bag with an empty [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2851.2999999999997s)]
*  plastic bottle at him. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2853.94s)]
*  And he turned around and [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2858.26s)]
*  shot him and killed him, right? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2859.14s)]
*  So apparently, and [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2860.94s)]
*  he was acquitted, so [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2862.42s)]
*  apparently that was enough. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2863.94s)]
*  My point here is, look, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2866.54s)]
*  I don't want her doing that, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2868.02s)]
*  I don't want anybody doing that. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2869.6600000000003s)]
*  And that's why I was super mad at [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2871.14s)]
*  Rittenhouse for, in his case, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2872.7400000000002s)]
*  he went and provoked things and [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2874.42s)]
*  he had a weapon and [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2876.1s)]
*  brandished it, etc., in my opinion. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2877.06s)]
*  And she was just walking by, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2879.86s)]
*  she was just walking by. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2882.14s)]
*  But they did things that were [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2884.62s)]
*  severe enough that a jury in this [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2886.02s)]
*  country said, if that was done to [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2887.74s)]
*  you, you're allowed to kill that [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2889.42s)]
*  other person. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2891.02s)]
*  And thank God none of that [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2892.98s)]
*  happened here. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2894.3s)]
*  But my point is, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2895.7s)]
*  this is getting out of hand. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2897.2599999999998s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2898.94s)]
*  And the reason it's getting out of [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2900.78s)]
*  hand is there's no balance at all. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2902.38s)]
*  We're not treating people fairly or [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2904.86s)]
*  equally at all. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2906.38s)]
*  One side gets all of the advantages [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2908.14s)]
*  and privileges, the other side [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2909.98s)]
*  gets nothing and [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2911.46s)]
*  she's not even on her side, right? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2912.14s)]
*  So if they don't, at this point, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2914.82s)]
*  take action, look, we asked the poll [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2916.78s)]
*  in the live chat, do you think [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2918.82s)]
*  they're going to take [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2920.18s)]
*  significant action? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2920.78s)]
*  I'd probably vote for C, which is [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2921.5s)]
*  some mild punishment is probably [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2923.2200000000003s)]
*  the only thing that will happen. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2924.82s)]
*  You guys are voting for no, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2926.38s)]
*  nothing will happen. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2927.7s)]
*  But the very fact that that's our [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2929.18s)]
*  expectation is damning, that our [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2931.46s)]
*  government is not fair and equal. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2933.7400000000002s)]
*  That there's one country that they [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2936.38s)]
*  value above all others. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2938.1s)]
*  And if you're protesting that [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2939.94s)]
*  country, you're in a world of [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2941.1s)]
*  trouble, right? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2942.2999999999997s)]
*  But if you're crazed on the side of [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2943.8199999999997s)]
*  that country and [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2945.74s)]
*  you attack someone, will there [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2946.7s)]
*  be, at UCLA, it took them so [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2948.58s)]
*  long to arrest only one guy out of [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2950.66s)]
*  so many people that attacked and [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2953.1s)]
*  did assaults. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2955.62s)]
*  We asked and asked and asked to get [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2957.54s)]
*  one or just one arrest for obvious [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2959.7799999999997s)]
*  assault with their faces wide open. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2962.1s)]
*  Well, I don't know, I don't know. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2965.06s)]
*  But when you send a sign that [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2966.9s)]
*  violence is okay from one side, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2968.38s)]
*  that is a super dangerous sign to [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2970.3399999999997s)]
*  send. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2972.74s)]
*  So and you're seeing the [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2974.2999999999997s)]
*  consequence of that. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2975.22s)]
*  And finally, the original [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2976.1s)]
*  protesters, not her, were [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2977.7799999999997s)]
*  protesting Itamar Ben-Gavir. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2979.48s)]
*  He is a literal terrorist. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2981.8599999999997s)]
*  He was adjudicated not even by [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2983.7799999999997s)]
*  international criminal courts, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2985.3399999999997s)]
*  by Israeli courts as aiding and [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2987.3799999999997s)]
*  abetting terrorism. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2989.2999999999997s)]
*  Now he's their security minister, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2991.18s)]
*  and he's terrorizing the West Bank, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2993.94s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2996.8199999999997s)]
*  He's one of the most awful [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=2998.3s)]
*  government leaders in [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3000.1400000000003s)]
*  the whole world. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3001.7000000000003s)]
*  He's one of the worst terrorists in [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3003.38s)]
*  the world, constantly talking about [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3004.98s)]
*  how they have to ethnically cleanse [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3006.7200000000003s)]
*  Gaza, wipe out all the Palestinians [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3008.38s)]
*  from Gaza and take Gaza. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3010.26s)]
*  And that's the guy that these [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3012.38s)]
*  people were celebrating, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3014.2200000000003s)]
*  celebrating. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3016.1800000000003s)]
*  They were an ecstatic joy over what [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3017.2200000000003s)]
*  the damage of the violence that he [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3019.46s)]
*  has done to Palestinian families. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3021.5800000000004s)]
*  So is it surprising that the people [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3024.02s)]
*  who are celebrating that monster [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3026.1000000000004s)]

*  will call out both sides of the aisle [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3117.3s)]
*  for corruption. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3119.42s)]
*  But how has the media been [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3120.26s)]
*  portraying that exchange that we [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3121.82s)]

*  Yeah, so look, this is a super [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3124.96s)]
*  interesting phenomenon. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3127.2200000000003s)]
*  Because we do a 42 minute interview, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3129.58s)]
*  it's great, it's about Rebellion PAC. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3132.3s)]
*  We call Democrats that are too [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3135.4s)]

*  etc. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3139.54s)]
*  We call it Republicans, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3140.04s)]
*  we call out Trump. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3141.3399999999997s)]
*  We call it everyone that's doing [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3142.58s)]
*  wrong and we give a positive [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3144.62s)]
*  solution, which is, hey, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3146.46s)]
*  why don't we do populism right? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3148.22s)]
*  Economic populism, the core six [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3149.94s)]
*  issues that are the populist plank [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3152.02s)]

*  Rebellion PAC, etc. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3154.94s)]
*  And as Charlemagne loves it, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3156.1s)]
*  we even talk about being on [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3157.8999999999996s)]
*  the advisory board, etc. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3159.54s)]
*  So we talk about John Stewart might [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3161.2599999999998s)]
*  run for president, Ro Khanna might, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3163.18s)]

*  Ro Khanna would be amazing in that [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3168.46s)]
*  line, he's John Rebellion PAC. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3170.7s)]
*  But the press doesn't talk about [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3172.74s)]
*  any of that. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3174.9399999999996s)]
*  Fox News sees a 30 second clip [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3176.02s)]
*  where we're criticizing Democrats. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3178.58s)]
*  They put that up because right wing [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3183.02s)]

*  criticism of Democrats to highlight. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3187.14s)]
*  Now, but what's interesting, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3190.14s)]
*  Jordan, is not just that they do [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3191.74s)]
*  that, but the other two things that [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3193.46s)]
*  happen. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3195.4199999999996s)]
*  One is, once right wing media cover [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3196.1s)]
*  something, then mainstream media [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3197.98s)]
*  will cover it. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3199.86s)]
*  If left wing media covers something, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3200.7s)]
*  mainstream media has no interest in [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3202.5s)]
*  it, none, zero, won't ever cover it. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3204.34s)]
*  We launched Rebellion PAC, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3206.34s)]
*  haven't gotten a single article yet. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3207.54s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3209.1s)]
*  We've got these amazing candidates, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3209.66s)]
*  we've got sitting congressmen all [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3211.5s)]
*  over media, people are buzzed about [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3213.14s)]
*  it. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3214.86s)]
*  I'm in DC, and senators are telling [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3215.38s)]
*  me, I heard about it, it's [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3217.34s)]
*  interesting, other congressmen are [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3218.82s)]
*  thinking of joining, but [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3220.86s)]
*  mainstream media, absolutely silent. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3222.38s)]
*  But the minute the Fox News did [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3224.98s)]
*  a segment on a 32nd part of that [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3226.48s)]
*  interview, then all of a sudden [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3228.1s)]
*  mainstream media start covering. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3229.7000000000003s)]
*  It's so frustrating, right? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3231.7400000000002s)]
*  And there's also nothing in reverse [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3233.86s)]
*  where someone sees something [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3235.98s)]
*  positive about the left wing, and [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3237.7000000000003s)]

*  around that, God forbid, no. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3241.54s)]

*  So that's why what you see in media [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3244.7000000000003s)]
*  is so skewed and often comes from [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3246.9s)]
*  a right wing perspective. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3248.94s)]
*  Does that make sense, Jordan? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3251.38s)]
*  It does, it does, and we've got [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPb2w_QbmU&t=3252.26s)]
