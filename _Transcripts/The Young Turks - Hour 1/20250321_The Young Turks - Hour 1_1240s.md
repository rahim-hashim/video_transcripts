# Trump Admin: WE SWEAR WE DIDN'T BRIEF ELON ON CHINA WAR PLANS!!!
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U)
*  Elon Musk is a patriot. Elon Musk is an innovator. Elon Musk provides a lot of capabilities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=0.0s)]
*  our government and our military rely on and I'm grateful for that. We welcomed him today [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=5.16s)]
*  to the Pentagon to talk about Doge, to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=9.48s)]
*  It was a great informal conversation. The rest of that reporting was fake. There was [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  no war plans. There was no Chinese war plans. There was no secret plans. That's not what [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  we were doing at the Pentagon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=23.52s)]
*  So in that clip, we learned something not really about the briefing that Elon Musk got [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  with the Pentagon. We'll talk about that in a second, but just that from all of what he [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=30.36s)]
*  said and all the body language, goddamn, Pete Hegseth is a weak little guy. He is. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=33.76s)]
*  It's a national shame and tragedy that he is in charge of our military, not only for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=40.04s)]
*  all the reasons that we knew before he was nominated and before he was confirmed, but [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=44.64s)]
*  just everything. He just, he has lackey energy. He has hide behind the bully energy and that's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=48.12s)]
*  hardly who you want in charge of the military. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=54.54s)]
*  But we're not here to talk mainly about Pete Hegseth today. We're here to talk about the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=58.78s)]
*  fact that the Trump administration is now, as you saw in that video, denying the reports [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=61.58s)]
*  from multiple sources inside of the Pentagon that they gave a special private briefing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=66.62s)]
*  to Elon Musk about what the United States would do were it to go to war with China. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=73.18s)]
*  That is certainly newsworthy, certainly a little bit odd. Elon Musk is not the secretary [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=79.9s)]
*  of the Department of Defense. He's not the secretary of anything. He is, at least if [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=85.9s)]
*  you believe what the White House says, not even in charge of DOGGI, the little organization [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=90.62s)]
*  concerned with modernizing our technology and efficiency. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=95.86000000000001s)]
*  So why exactly he would be getting these private briefings, I think is raising a lot of alarms. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=99.62s)]
*  Now, they're saying that it's not happening. Pete Hegseth is saying that, as we'll get [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=104.94s)]
*  to, Donald Trump is saying that it didn't actually happen. They haven't really earned [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=108.54s)]
*  a lot of credibility, I don't think, in terms of truthfulness, either of them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=115.5s)]
*  And so that's a bit of an issue for them. But according to those sources, the Pentagon [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=119.42s)]
*  was scheduled on today to brief Elon Musk on those plans concerning China. And it apparently [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=123.18s)]
*  did happen. The only question is exactly what was said during that. And so we know what was planned [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=130.86s)]
*  and it was not vague. It was very specific. Again, three sources and they said that it [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=138.78s)]
*  would concern 20 to 30 slides that lay out how the United States would fight such a conflict [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=144.06s)]
*  with China. It covered the plan beginning with the indications and warning of a threat from China to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=149.98s)]
*  various options on what Chinese targets to hit over what time period that would be presented to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=154.14s)]
*  Trump for decisions. So this is already, this is in no way the concern of Elon Musk, who's only [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=158.78s)]
*  there. He's only getting this briefing because he bought the Republican Party and bought [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=166.14s)]
*  Donald Trump for about 300 million as a down payment and he's spending more as we move forward. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=170.22s)]
*  He's a rich guy. That's it. And evidently, that's all it takes. If you're the world's richest man, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=175.98s)]
*  if you buy the Republican Party, you might get access to the most closely guarded national [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=182.38s)]
*  security secrets. That, were you to leak those to China for your own interest, if you were to, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't know, tweet them so that right wingers would think you were cool, could do irreparable [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=193.9s)]
*  damage to American national security. And we have just decided that this guy that we've never even [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  gotten a confirmation has a security clearance, has had a background check, anything like that, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=203.34s)]
*  evidently had this hearing again, according to multiple sources. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  And as we'll get into, there's many different conflicts that Elon Musk has concerning his [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=213.74s)]
*  business interests in China. And so this is getting a lot of people to be really concerned. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=219.58s)]
*  We're gonna turn in a moment to what Donald Trump has had to say about this. But Jordan, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=224.62s)]
*  I wanna start with you. Elon Musk has had ridiculous access and ridiculous power for a guy [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  with no real formal job in the administration. But this feels to me like the most significant [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  single thing. What do you make of it? Yeah, no, it absolutely is. There's a serious risk here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=238.94s)]
*  And I'm not one to clutch my pearls typically over national security risks. But I think here, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=244.46s)]
*  if you wanna just take it as an objective story, despite Trump's denials, the risks here, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=250.78s)]
*  when you juxtapose it with what anyone else with a security clearance has to go through. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=258.14s)]
*  I've known people who have security clearances or have worked at different three letter agencies. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=263.02s)]
*  They look into your bank accounts to make sure you aren't in debt, because that is a vulnerability. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=268.62s)]
*  Let's look at Elon Musk's relationships with China, right? His largest factory for Tesla is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=274.06s)]
*  in Shanghai, which produces over half of Tesla's supplies, over half of their cars. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=279.5s)]
*  They have a massive battery factory also in Shanghai, which they just opened in 2024. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=285.9s)]
*  And nearly half of their supply chain is in China for batteries. But unlike any other foreign car [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=290.78s)]
*  company, Tesla can operate independently. For example, Volkswagen had to start a new [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=297.98s)]
*  joint venture with a Chinese company. So he has preferential treatment, a huge vested stake, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=304.06s)]
*  but he also has nearly half a billion dollars in loans from state run banks in China. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  So you go back to what I was saying earlier, people with security clearances here in the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  government, their finances are poured over by the government to make sure because you're at risk for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=318.3s)]
*  a bribe. If you have debt, someone can come in and say, hey, we'll take care of this for you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=324.86s)]
*  In exchange, we want X, Y, and Z. And you're even considering giving a guy who has half a billion [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=330.86s)]
*  dollars in loans from the Chinese state run banks. This information, it's jaw dropping. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=336.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he hasn't had a background check because he's not gonna pass one and they know [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=343.42s)]
*  that. So how can they spin that? They just won't give it to him. But this does raise a lot of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  questions, not necessarily new questions, but questions around what are the actual parameters [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=352.62s)]
*  around Elon's powers? John, you mentioned that he doesn't really have an official position [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=358.94s)]
*  in our government. He wasn't elected into position. He may or may not be the head of DOGE. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=363.42s)]
*  It really depends on who you ask and what day, because some days he is and some days he isn't. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=368.38s)]
*  But how much authority does he actually have in our government? How is he able to just say things [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=373.58s)]
*  like, I don't think you mentioned this part yet, but he threatened journalists saying things like [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=378.7s)]
*  they will be found with people who are leaking things to journalists. That's such an overreach. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=383.42s)]
*  What kind of power does this guy actually have? The answer is obviously that there are no [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=388.62s)]
*  parameters as long as he is useful to Trump. He can do and say whatever he wants because Trump [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=393.26s)]
*  is going to protect him. And all of Congress that backs Trump is also going to protect him [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=398.06s)]
*  because they supposedly believe in the work that he's doing. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=403.09999999999997s)]
*  But really because Trump wants him there. And that's something that we're gonna have to watch [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=406.46s)]
*  play out. The only reason why Trump is giving Elon so much access, whether or not he actually was [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  at this China war briefing with the Pentagon, is because Trump is getting something out of having [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=415.65999999999997s)]
*  Elon so close to him. So for as long as he is useful, he's gonna be around. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=421.34s)]
*  And right now, I think he's useful to Trump in the sense that a lot of people are mad at Elon [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=426.85999999999996s)]
*  Musk and not so much at Trump pointing a lot. Trump is getting half of the fingers that he [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=431.18s)]
*  should have pointed at him, pointed at him because the other half are going to Elon Musk. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=436.3s)]
*  Even though everything he wants is doing is because Trump either wants him to or is letting [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=440.14s)]
*  him do it. Yeah, or I mean, the third option is has to. It's easy to think, well, he wants [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=444.14s)]
*  Elon in that meeting, but why? Why would Donald Trump, who one year ago had no interest in Elon [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=451.02s)]
*  Musk whatsoever, why would he want Elon Musk involved in this? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=459.02s)]
*  I think a far simpler explanation, a sort of political Occam's razor answer to this is, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=462.38s)]
*  Elon Musk said I want this and Donald Trump can say yes, or he can say no. And then Elon Musk [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=468.94s)]
*  doesn't spend half a billion dollars on midterms. And maybe, I don't know, a billion dollars the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=476.38s)]
*  next presidential election. This is the issue when you have corruption on a scale, an order [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=483.82s)]
*  of magnitude higher than anything we've seen before. If you are a MAGA person out there, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=489.58s)]
*  how are you going to say that you know for sure that Donald Trump likes any of this? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=494.06s)]
*  When he has bought, when he has been purchased for $290 million and 100 million that's already been [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=501.18s)]
*  promised for the midterms and 20 million that's gone towards swaying a judicial election in [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=507.98s)]
*  Wisconsin that's happening right now. When sums like that are being thrown around, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=513.26s)]
*  how can Donald Trump tell him no? How can the Republicans in Congress tell Elon Musk no? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=517.74s)]
*  How can they? There's just too much money on the line. And so Elon Musk effectively can just demand [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=524.86s)]
*  whatever he wants, let alone the fact that we shouldn't be relying on this guy's corporations [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=530.38s)]
*  for a significant percentage of military technology. Let's say that Pete Hegseth [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=534.9399999999999s)]
*  wasn't being a massive liar in the video we showed you, which he was, but let's say that he wasn't. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=538.7s)]
*  They do actually rely on Starlink and stuff like that. Should our military be dependent on one [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=543.1800000000001s)]
*  deranged childish foreign born billionaire? Is that the MAGA way? Is that make America great again? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=549.74s)]
*  Is that America first? None of this is. Why is Donald Trump effectively, arguably being [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=556.14s)]
*  led around on a dog leash by the richest man in the world who's getting access that you'd never [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=562.14s)]
*  feel comfortable if George Soros was like, I wanna be briefed on the war plans or whatever. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=569.02s)]
*  Whoever, insert a billionaire. Bill Gates wants briefings on, I don't know, how chips can be [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=574.14s)]
*  integrated into your bloodstream or something. You'd never be comfortable with that. Why [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=580.9399999999999s)]
*  is the MAGA movement so willingly and so wholly surrendering to Elon Musk in this? Why are they [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=585.18s)]
*  okay with this much corruption? I'll never understand it. Now, Donald Trump has been freaking [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=591.66s)]
*  out about these reports and he should. It looks terrible. It makes him look incredibly weak. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=596.38s)]
*  So anyway, he truth social posted the fake news is the enemy of the people. So don't focus on [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=601.26s)]
*  the fact that a billionaire has all this access. Instead get mad at Maggie Haberman or whatever. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=606.06s)]
*  And Elon is not being briefed on anything China by the Department of War. So let's set aside [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=611.58s)]
*  for now that grandpa apparently has forgotten that it hasn't been called the Department of War [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=618.54s)]
*  in like 80 years or whatever. Imagine if Joe Biden did that super weird. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=622.54s)]
*  Literally in his entire life has not been called that. Why is he calling it that super weird? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=627.42s)]
*  But anyway, as he has alluded to, Musk is saying that he wants the leakers at the Pentagon who [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=632.14s)]
*  leaked maliciously false information to be locked up again. I've seen no evidence yet that what they [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=638.3s)]
*  said was untrue and why would three people independently lie in this way? It doesn't make [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=645.42s)]
*  any sense. But again, they want to lock up everyone who gets in their way. That's par for [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=651.74s)]
*  the course at this point. And so they had this meeting and as they're coming out, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=655.42s)]
*  New York Times reporters asked them what was actually discussed. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=661.02s)]
*  If it wasn't China war plans, why did Musk have to have any sort of briefing with the Pentagon? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=665.42s)]
*  And Pete Hex has said, why would I tell you? And I have no doubt that MAGA will agree. Yeah, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=671.5s)]
*  why would journalists, why would you tell journalists that? Well, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=677.18s)]
*  journalists are how you get information. They're effectively saying to an intermediary, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=680.78s)]
*  why would I tell any American what's going on here? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=686.14s)]
*  You peasants don't need to know rich, powerful people were in the meeting. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=690.3s)]
*  You're not our concern. You don't get to know about that stuff. Billionaires are talking. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=695.7399999999999s)]
*  All of you can shut the hell up. That's the message that I got from that. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=700.06s)]
*  But anyway, I want to turn before we discuss a bit more to one more bit of video. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=703.5s)]
*  And this is Donald Trump having to engage with the idea that Elon Musk's foreign business ties [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=707.42s)]
*  with China could actually be sort of an issue. You guys are denying this New York Times report [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=713.26s)]
*  that Elon Musk was going to be shown a 20 to 30 page presentation about a theoretical [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=718.94s)]
*  war plan against China. Why not just show it to Elon? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=724.22s)]
*  Because I don't want to show it to anybody. You're talking about a potential war with China, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=728.4599999999999s)]
*  but I don't want to show that to anybody. But certainly you wouldn't show it to a business man [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=734.4599999999999s)]
*  who is helping us so much. He's a great patriot. He's taking, he's paying a big price for helping [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=738.14s)]
*  us cut costs. And he's doing a great job. He's finding tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=744.3s)]
*  But I certainly wouldn't want, Elon has businesses in China and he would be susceptible perhaps to [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=749.8199999999999s)]
*  that. Yeah, I think I'm glad that he was willing to admit that that he was willing to recognize [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=756.14s)]
*  that having these business ties with China while being charge of policy would be a corrupting [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=761.26s)]
*  factor. I wish that he would look briefly in the mirror and realize that that same argument works [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=766.62s)]
*  perfectly well on Donald Trump who also has those business ties. I guess it doesn't count though, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=770.62s)]
*  if you're not Hunter Biden or whatever. But there he was like trying to present distance. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=775.02s)]
*  I don't need to tell it to a businessman who by the way is like the best thing ever. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=781.34s)]
*  My God, he's doing such amazing work. Please, Elon, keep spending money on the Republican Party. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=785.98s)]
*  All of this is just so sad. Again, they're never gonna reveal what was actually there. We are going [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=791.3399999999999s)]
*  to have to for the next four years rely on leakers. We won't know for sure if they're being honest. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=796.86s)]
*  We hope that with multiple sources we can trust it, but you simply can't trust at this point [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=803.74s)]
*  anything coming out of Donald Trump or Elon Musk or Pete Hegseth. And so this is the really [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=808.38s)]
*  crummy position we're in, Jordan, but any other thoughts about this? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=813.18s)]
*  Jordan Blomkamp Yeah, I want to take a closer look at his comment. He said, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=815.9799999999999s)]
*  I don't want to show it to anybody. You're talking about a potential war with China. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=818.9399999999999s)]
*  Since when? Why are we talking about a potential war with China? And I think even though it's [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=824.3s)]
*  clearly wrong calling the Department of Defense Department of War, like you pointed out, John, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=830.54s)]
*  it reflects a broader militaristic and hawkish mindset in this administration. So I ask, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=835.42s)]
*  where are the anti-war Republicans that we heard so much about? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=841.5s)]
*  Where's anti-war Trump that we heard all about on the campaign trail? No new wars during his first [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=844.46s)]
*  term. He's going to continue that legacy, right? No, we're seeing reports this week and last week [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=850.38s)]
*  that he's inching closer to a war with Iran. Now he's briefing people like Elon Musk and others in [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=855.18s)]
*  his administration on a potential war with China. Where are these so-called anti-war Republicans? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=861.42s)]
*  Now's the time to stand up and speak out. Do you care about this or not? Of course, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=866.38s)]
*  we knew it was ingenuous, but disingenuous. But what we're seeing here is a shift back to [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=870.38s)]
*  the old neocon hawkish Republican Party that they tried to cover up with a facade for years. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=879.5s)]
*  Many people fell for it, including some on the left, sadly. And it's the result in part of the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=885.58s)]
*  Democrats' seating ground to the right on war and on foreign policy. When you have hawkish [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=893.18s)]
*  Democrats leading the party, it creates an opportunity and a vacuum for the right to exploit [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=899.9s)]
*  on this topic. So the response should be a strong and unified opposition to any war, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=905.0999999999999s)]
*  potential war with Iran or China. Unfortunately, there are many Democrats [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=911.8199999999999s)]
*  who probably would support both of those fronts. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=915.9799999999999s)]
*  It's funny, I like the way you presented that Jordan, because I did have kind of a moment when [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=917.9s)]
*  I was reading about this story and I was like, since when are we going to war with China? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=923.66s)]
*  The thing is, this isn't a new conflict that they're referring to, but the idea of war with [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=928.06s)]
*  China, it's kind of been on the table since the Biden administration even from before that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=933.18s)]
*  regarding China and its relationship to Taiwan. But all this ramped up rhetoric around the war [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=938.54s)]
*  with China, the pending war with China, it's very sudden, it feels like. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=946.06s)]
*  And then on top of that, we have a potential war with Iran. And on top of that, Trump has been [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=951.5s)]
*  talking about invading Panama and Greenland and Canada, this anti-war president. That is one of [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=955.9s)]
*  the things that they love to say about Donald Trump too. It's not like there just weren't any [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=961.7399999999999s)]
*  wars whenever he was first president. There were always conflicts, so that was always a weird [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=966.8599999999999s)]
*  comment that people used to say about him because we're always kind of at war. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=971.34s)]
*  But that was his big selling point. He's the anti-war president, I guess, he didn't really [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=977.26s)]
*  start anything. He also hasn't ended the war in Ukraine or the situation in Israel and Palestine [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=983.58s)]
*  yet, which he said he was going to do. But regarding Elon Musk and Donald Trump, these two men are [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=988.7s)]
*  comically entangled with one another. And John kind of alluded to this, they have such a weird [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=994.86s)]
*  relationship where they both kind of need each other for one reason or another. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1000.06s)]
*  But they don't really like each other, but they have to pretend like they do. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1004.78s)]
*  And so we're just watching this all play out. But the reality is that the things that we're [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1008.14s)]
*  talking about and the things that they are doing with the Pentagon, with the military, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1012.4599999999999s)]
*  with all of their businesses and all of their business interests around the globe, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1017.9s)]
*  it's very scary stuff that these people are so childish. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1022.4599999999999s)]
*  And we just all have to kind of see where their whims take them, right? China has said that they [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1025.42s)]
*  already consider SpaceX to be an extension of the US military, so that is serious, right? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1031.66s)]
*  And Elon Musk, he's called Taiwan's independence from China arbitrary and compared Taiwan is to [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1037.18s)]
*  China as Hawaii is to the United States. It's just over there, but it's ours and we know that. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1045.02s)]
*  That's not the case in Taiwan with China, but the fact that he's saying these things is very [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1050.6200000000001s)]
*  distressing, very problematic. He shouldn't be saying these things. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1056.46s)]
*  But the fact that he is technically outside of our federal government, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1060.06s)]
*  he's allowed to say whatever he wants without any kind of pushback, right? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1063.58s)]
*  These are incredible conflicts that not only impact people's actual lives, but they're [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1067.1s)]
*  rooted in history. These conflicts haven't just sprung out of nowhere, even though now we're [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1071.58s)]
*  talking about it now. They go back decades at least and they involve several world superpowers. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1077.1s)]
*  But for all of that here, we have Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, who is supposedly, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1082.62s)]
*  allegedly getting Pentagon briefings regarding global geopolitical situations. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1087.82s)]
*  But he's really worried about how much money he has or how much money he will or won't have [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1093.1s)]
*  if a war does or does not happen, let's be real. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1097.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think we are long past the point where Democrats should be figuring out some way to get [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1100.8600000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk out of government. They're not gonna be able to do it instantly, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1107.18s)]
*  but it's certainly something to run on. Nobody likes Elon Musk and fewer will like him every day. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1109.74s)]
*  Getting him, and if necessary not him individually, but every billionaire out of politics, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1115.66s)]
*  I think would be a massive improvement for national security among other things. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1120.3s)]
*  You guys were totally right. It is utter chaos, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1123.9s)]
*  Donald Trump's foreign policy from a guy that was sold as being like the peace president, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1127.9s)]
*  which as you say, never made sense. He didn't end a single war the first time he was president, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1132.3000000000002s)]
*  and he escalated all of the ones we were already in. And he's already doing that now. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1137.5800000000002s)]
*  We're bombing Yemen even more than we were. He's threatening to ethnically cleanse and occupy Gaza, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1141.98s)]
*  one of the many territories around the world that he plans to just steal from its inhabitants. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1149.18s)]
*  And not only is he planning new wars, but he's paving the way for other authoritarian governments. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1154.86s)]
*  So he's giving with his weak and feckless position on Ukraine. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1160.54s)]
*  He's telling Vladimir Putin, like, hey, bide your time a little bit and then you could utterly [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1164.78s)]
*  conquer Ukraine and probably other countries too. He already said within the last week that our [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1168.3799999999999s)]
*  former guarantee that we would defend Taiwan and maybe not so much. So he's encouraging China to [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1173.58s)]
*  potentially start invading their neighbors. And all of this is convenient for a couple [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1178.7s)]
*  different reasons. First of all, I think he likes the idea that effectively you could have [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1182.86s)]
*  a dark league of world dictators that carve the world up into individual slices that they each have [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1187.6599999999999s)]
*  utter control over. And even if not that, it's very convenient that if your domestic policies [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1193.74s)]
*  are gonna be wildly unpopular because all the economic damage they would do. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1200.62s)]
*  If you plan, for instance, to maybe hand $5 to $10 trillion over to America's billionaires, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1203.82s)]
*  wouldn't it be great if you had a few more world conflicts to help distract people? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1209.1s)]
*  Where you can easily cow Republicans into rallying around the flag and believing that for some [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1213.58s)]
*  reason us going to war with China is patriotic, then maybe they won't notice the stuff you're [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1218.62s)]
*  doing domestically. All of this is utter chaos, utter corruption. And so in that way, it's pretty, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1223.34s)]
*  again, par for the course for Donald Trump's second term. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1230.3s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets a swings. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1232.94s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNSVzXg2_U&t=1236.14s)]
