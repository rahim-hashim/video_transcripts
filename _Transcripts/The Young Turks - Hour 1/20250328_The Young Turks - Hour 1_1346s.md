"In August 2022, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade ominously warned his audience that ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äôs new army‚Äù of armed IRS agents was going to ‚Äúhunt down and kill middle class taxpayers.‚Äù But after masked, plainclothes federal officers from the Department of Homeland Security abducted Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk off the street in Somerville, Massachusetts, on Tuesday, Kilmeade sang a different tune."*

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# ‚ÄúFree Speech Absolutists" CHEER the Abduction of Tufts University Student Rumeysa Ozturk
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE)
*  This Romesa O'Turk is a Turkish national who's maintaining an F1 visa as a PhD student at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=0.0s)]
*  Tufts University. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  She was arrested yesterday, you'll see it on camera, after writing an opinion essay [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=9.0s)]
*  criticizing the university's response to the demands that Tufts quote, acknowledge the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=13.14s)]
*  Palestinian genocide, divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=17.46s)]
*  And I imagine there's more to her case. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=22.84s)]
*  I love the message it's sending to other students causing unrest. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=25.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think disappearing a PhD student off the streets around a university because [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=28.16s)]
*  you disagreed with an op-ed they wrote over a year ago certainly sends a message. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=34.4s)]
*  Not the sort of message I think most people are loving right now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=39.04s)]
*  So we're gonna get to that, but Cenk, what do you think he's implying with that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=42.84s)]
*  I think he's implying that you better watch yourself. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=46.84s)]
*  If you criticize Israel, masked men will show up in the middle of America and whisk you [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=50.72s)]
*  away in a van to a secret location. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=55.76s)]
*  And God knows if you'll ever get out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=58.64s)]
*  So that's definitely the message that they wanna send. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=60.1s)]
*  And there's Brian Kilmeade on Fox News, cheerleading it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=62.48s)]
*  Yes, oppression and tyranny. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=65.2s)]
*  And by the way, not even for this country, for a totally different country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=67.0s)]
*  It's amazing how they do that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=70.4s)]
*  But one of the big questions we have and it's in the live chat poll too is, is this going [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=72.48s)]
*  to make any Trump voters realize that this is a freedom of speech issue? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  And that they should actually stand up for this person. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=83.98s)]
*  Or are they just gonna be like, we're a foreigner. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=86.42s)]
*  We never meant speech anyway, speech, who cares? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=89.94s)]
*  I mean, against Israel, no, you're not allowed to do that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=92.06s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=94.14s)]
*  Let's find out, John. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=95.38000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, maybe they have a defense mechanism though that we just saw trotted out by Brian [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=96.54s)]
*  Kilmeade. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=100.86s)]
*  Because sure, it looks bad when someone who's just been quietly working on their doctorate [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=101.86s)]
*  for the better part of a decade writes an op-ed and you kidnap her. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=107.06s)]
*  That sounds bad. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=112.1s)]
*  But don't worry, he imagines there's more to it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=113.1s)]
*  That's Brian Kilmeade's response. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=117.44s)]
*  He sees tyranny on video, no evidence of criminality, no allegations of crimes being committed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  But he imagines there's more to it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  It's nice when you give the dictator the benefit of the doubt. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=128.18s)]
*  Well, anyway, what's interesting and especially ironic about this when it comes to Brian Kilmeade [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=131.38s)]
*  is Brian Kilmeade has talked about effectively what we saw there, a Gestapo, people going [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=135.72s)]
*  around maybe not even with the uniforms on and enforcing the will of the authoritarian [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=141.98s)]
*  leader only of course, he wasn't talking about Donald Trump doing something like that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=145.66s)]
*  No, back in 2022, he said that under Joe Biden, the IRS would hunt down and potentially kill [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=150.01999999999998s)]
*  taxpayers, watch. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=157.26s)]
*  Before the IRS took it down yesterday, there was a posting, watch this, on their website [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  that listed the job requirements for a special agent's position. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  The major duties require agents to quote, carry a firearm and be willing to use deadly [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=167.16s)]
*  force if necessary. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=171.6s)]
*  A little like James Bond, but instead of hunting down evil maniacs, these agents hunt down [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=172.6s)]
*  and kill middle class taxpayers that don't pay enough. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=178.04s)]
*  It's Joe Biden's new army. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=181.78s)]
*  I love that he needed to clarify that in this nightmare, it's at least middle class taxpayers [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=182.78s)]
*  that are being gunned down. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=187.56s)]
*  If it's poor taxpayers, that apparently doesn't even merit a conversation for Brian Kilmeade. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=188.56s)]
*  And we all know that the last couple of years, the IRS did rack up quite the kill count of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=193.04s)]
*  taxpayers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=198.16s)]
*  So he was right there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=199.16s)]
*  Obviously, we gotta give credit where credit is due. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=200.32s)]
*  But it is funny when under Joe Biden, you fantasize about this sort of thing happening. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  And now you're seeing it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=207.6s)]
*  And rather than being consistent or even maybe just briefly pushing back and saying, hey, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=209.12s)]
*  I don't agree with her op-ed, but could you at least allege that she threw a bottle or [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=214.8s)]
*  something? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=219.68s)]
*  Maybe Molotovs? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=220.68s)]
*  No, nothing like that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=221.68s)]
*  He imagines there's probably more to it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=222.68s)]
*  And to go back to the original point that he had made about the message being sent, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=225.54s)]
*  which I do agree it's sending one. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=229.08s)]
*  Lawrence Jones, also of Fox, apparently likes that message. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=231.68s)]
*  He wants to speech to be chilled. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=236.08s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=238.12s)]
*  I am concerned about free speech. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=239.12s)]
*  I am a free speech absolutist. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=241.0s)]
*  And so I wonder, what is the criteria here? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  Should we be deporting people who say criticize America and American policies? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  What's the line? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=252.96s)]
*  Or is it only if you criticize Israeli government policy? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=253.96s)]
*  So there are a lot of really good people right now who are very concerned about the chilling [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=258.64s)]
*  effect this could have. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=265.8s)]
*  Not just on these green card holders and these people on visas, but what's the message to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=267.4s)]
*  American citizens about free speech? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  So I would just say this, Rachel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=275.24s)]
*  I see your point. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=276.52s)]
*  I see how it could be chilling. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  But I want chills to run down the spines of not only terrorists, but people that are residents [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=284.32s)]
*  You're a visitor here. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=285.32s)]
*  You don't have the right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=286.32s)]
*  Be on your best behavior here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=287.32s)]
*  And what we're dealing with is people that don't love the country, people that have radical [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=289.08s)]
*  ties. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=293.8s)]
*  And I think they're trying to use our laws against us at the time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=294.8s)]
*  I love the idea of using the laws against us, like the rights given to you by the law [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=298.04s)]
*  or the Constitution. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=302.56s)]
*  That's not supposed to be for you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=303.56s)]
*  That's you using it against us. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=305.52s)]
*  I briefly was gonna have to have the uncomfortable experience of giving Rachel Campos Duffy credit [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=307.28s)]
*  for something. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=312.0s)]
*  But don't worry, once he said he wants them to apparently live in terror, that if they [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=313.32s)]
*  post the wrong thing online, they could be deported, she immediately agreed with it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=317.92s)]
*  So it seemed as if she was being kind of consistent about free speech. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=323.26s)]
*  She's an absolutist after all. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=327.12s)]
*  But again, as soon as the prospect of somebody who cares about Palestinian kids being bombed, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=329.24s)]
*  living in terror, suddenly the absolutism fell apart and she was totally fine with it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=334.2s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=338.24s)]
*  Yeah, so let's talk about here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=339.68s)]
*  First of all, in terms of Duffy, I think the only reason why she even said that comment [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=342.0s)]
*  is not because she genuinely thinks it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=348.0s)]
*  And to be fair to her, if she does great and I wish that she would have stuck up against [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  her colleague who are like, yeah, I mean, you wanna take away the speech rights of people [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=355.2s)]
*  living in America to serve Israel. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  And then America could be second or maybe third or eighth and you know what, and well, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=361.7s)]
*  let's terrorize them because they're the terrorists. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=365.24s)]
*  You literally just said you wanted to terrorize people, by the way, let's just note that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=370.04s)]
*  But the reason I think she's saying it is because a lot of right wingers are now going, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=374.92s)]
*  wait, not a lot, but some, some. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  And remember, they don't care about the left at all, they don't care about any of the rest [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=382.44s)]
*  of us. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=385.12s)]
*  But when some folks in America are like, wait, we're rounding up people if they criticize [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=386.12s)]
*  a different country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  But by the way, again, I emphasize this every, you can criticize America all day long. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=391.90000000000003s)]
*  She wrote an op-ed about how America was the worst thing on planet Earth. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  She'd be perfectly fine. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=398.8s)]
*  Norway, have at it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=399.8s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, no problem. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=400.8s)]
*  Israel, round them up, round them up. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=402.8s)]
*  And so this idea that it's not Israel or you're not allowed to say that it's Israel is, I [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=404.8s)]
*  mean, it's a very sad joke. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  Green New Deal or Dragon wrote in on Twitch, and I love doing the show with our members. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=411.16s)]
*  I love their questions, their comments, etc. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=415.68s)]
*  Be part of that, hit the join button below. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=417.56s)]
*  They wrote in, do we know where exactly the Israeli black site is in Louisiana? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=420.2s)]
*  That's a literal question. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=426.8s)]
*  They're making these people disappear into a black site in Louisiana and not saying where [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=428.36s)]
*  they are. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=433.44s)]
*  So Israel has some sort of dungeon in Louisiana that they're running. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=434.76s)]
*  I mean, of course, we're paying for it, we're running it, etc. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  But we're doing it on behalf of Israel. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  But don't worry, they're only kidnapping people with student visa, well, also legal residents, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=445.12s)]
*  green card holders. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=451.76s)]
*  But it's not like they're coming out of an unmarked van with unmarked clothes and masks [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=453.68s)]
*  on like they're some sort of terrorists looking to terrorize us. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=458.03999999999996s)]
*  Fox News is bragging about now. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=462.0s)]
*  No, right, that's exactly what they're doing. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=463.68s)]
*  And then he says, Jones does, we want them to be on their best behavior. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  So criticizing Israel in an op-ed is not your best behavior. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=471.7s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=479.4s)]
*  When did that become illegal? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=480.68s)]
*  First important thing for you guys to understand, Supreme Court President is that people who [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=482.68s)]
*  are in the country legally, no matter what their citizenship status is, have the same [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=488.12s)]
*  protections as American citizens on constitutional rights, including freedom of speech. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  So if the courts now take away that right from people who hold student visas, or who [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=498.76s)]
*  have green cards and are legal residents here in America, that means they're also beginning [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=505.4s)]
*  to chip away at that right for US citizens. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=510.64s)]
*  And soon, no one will be allowed to criticize Israel. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=514.24s)]
*  And if you do, you'll be snapped up in the streets. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=517.18s)]
*  And by the way, superlizing before I kick it over to Maz is that what John mentioned [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=519.72s)]
*  there in the beginning about, he imagines they have a good reason for it, is what I'm [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=524.68s)]
*  seeing all over online. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=528.52s)]
*  For the folks who are being hypocritical about this in the right wing, free speech for me, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=530.16s)]
*  but not free speech for you, right? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=537.32s)]
*  Free speech against America, but not free speech against Israel, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=539.4s)]
*  For those guys, they're excused that I see a thousand times. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=543.5600000000001s)]
*  By the way, whether it's this issue or other issues like Trump's corruption, which we're [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=549.28s)]
*  gonna talk about later in the show. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=552.52s)]
*  Well, I'm sure he has a good reason. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=554.0s)]
*  I'm sure there's secret evidence. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=556.12s)]
*  Our country doesn't run on secret evidence and secret black sites. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=558.48s)]
*  Our country runs on freedom of speech and serving this country and not another country. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm so curious whether Americans are going to rebel at some point, or if they're gonna [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=568.92s)]
*  say no, no, no, running a tyrannical government on behalf of a foreign country is okay. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=574.04s)]
*  And that's what makes America great again. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  That's what gives us our freedoms. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=584.56s)]
*  And by the way, you wanna talk about cancel culture. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  When the Israeli thought police kidnap you in the middle of the street, I'm pretty sure [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=590.88s)]
*  you're getting canceled. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=595.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, that clip you guys showed of Kill Me talking about the IRS agents [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=596.8399999999999s)]
*  and how there was the requirement for weapons or carrying weapons. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=601.56s)]
*  They're IRS agents, nobody likes them. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=605.64s)]
*  So they probably need the weapons for self-defense. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=608.1999999999999s)]
*  That's going all the way back to that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  But what you guys are saying is so spot on. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=613.16s)]
*  I come from Iran and when I posted this clip on my Instagram page, a lot of people, people [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=615.8399999999999s)]
*  from Iran were saying, my gosh, this reminds me of what happens in Iran. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=621.52s)]
*  When in Iran, they stop people and they go, you insulted God. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=625.2s)]
*  And now they're saying you insulted Israel. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=629.0s)]
*  And the problem is that America is supposed to be a tolerant society that allows people [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=631.8000000000001s)]
*  to express their opinions. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=638.36s)]
*  And as you said, a lot of people are saying, well, there must be other reasons. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=640.2s)]
*  That's the other thing that I've seen that's been interesting is, again, on my Instagram [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  page, there's some people that are immigrants to this country who are turning around and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=647.96s)]
*  they should kick her out. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=652.76s)]
*  And I'm going, first of all, you're not safe. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=655.36s)]
*  Because originally the idea was that they're going to only go after undocumented immigrants [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=659.4s)]
*  who have committed crimes. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=664.96s)]
*  And then it was undocumented immigrants. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=666.9s)]
*  And then it was now green card holders. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=669.12s)]
*  And now they want to get rid of birthright citizenship. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=672.48s)]
*  So the fact is, if Marco Rubio decides that you said something that he doesn't like, he [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=675.16s)]
*  could say, you know what, because he called them, said, I'm going after all these lunatics. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=679.7199999999999s)]
*  They call you a lunatic the same way in Iran. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=684.04s)]
*  They say you are against religion and they disappear you. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=686.12s)]
*  And that's the kind of stuff that happens in Russia and in Iran and in China and other [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=690.4s)]
*  totalitarian states. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=694.7399999999999s)]
*  And now it's happening right in front of our eyes. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=695.9599999999999s)]
*  So for people, even if they don't agree with these people's opinions, they are giving up. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=697.8s)]
*  We are that line of people as we're seeing the dictatorship and authoritarianism take [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=705.88s)]
*  over this country. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=711.6s)]
*  It happened in Iran. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=713.12s)]
*  I saw it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=714.24s)]
*  I was a kid then, but I've gone back and looked at there was a lot of people who were like, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=716.24s)]
*  oh, no, it's not going to be that bad, not going to be that bad, not going to be that. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=719.88s)]
*  And before you know it, there's a million things you can't say. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=722.4399999999999s)]
*  And if you look at the game plan, if you go to project 2025, which people kept warning [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=725.84s)]
*  people about a lot of those things are being implemented. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=730.8s)]
*  And pretty soon, if you go say something about Jesus or the flag or guns, they might say, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=733.76s)]
*  hey, you know what, that's un-American of you and we're going to make you disappear. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  So everyone should be upset about this. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  And then look, some of them might think, well, I mean, he would never do that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=748.84s)]
*  But if he did, well, then a judge would stop them or whatever. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=753.4s)]
*  They were ordered not to move her and they defied it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=756.62s)]
*  Judge said don't move her just as they have in other cases too, just as they did with [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  the Venezuelans. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=763.68s)]
*  And the White House told them to kick rocks and they just didn't abide by the orders of [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  these judges. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=769.92s)]
*  And they're already like championing at the bit to send American citizens for all sorts [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=771.4399999999999s)]
*  of different crimes outside of the country. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=776.4399999999999s)]
*  We had Trump like talking about how those who defaced Tesla's or whatever could end [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  up going to that Salvadoran prison. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=783.8199999999999s)]
*  And if they do that, what do we think? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=785.9599999999999s)]
*  Brian Kilmeade is going to be aggrieved. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=788.3599999999999s)]
*  Jesse Waters is going to do a monologue about how, no, I was maga, but this has gone too [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=790.84s)]
*  far. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=794.44s)]
*  This is an utterly lawless regime. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=795.6s)]
*  Donald Trump did his executive order a couple days ago to make it significantly harder to [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=797.88s)]
*  register to vote. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=802.46s)]
*  They're trying to wipe out literally millions of voters as many of his strongest backers [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=803.46s)]
*  are still openly talking about him running for a third term. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=809.32s)]
*  This is an utterly lawless, like we throw in these terms of this looks dictatorial. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=812.98s)]
*  I don't know what about this administration at this point does not. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=818.0799999999999s)]
*  They don't care, like they control Congress, but are still ignoring it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=821.5999999999999s)]
*  He could get anything he wants out of the Republican Congress. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  He's still telling them to F off because he doesn't want to even set a precedent that [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=829.12s)]
*  Congress matters. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=833.5999999999999s)]
*  So that if the Democrats ever take control of it, he doesn't want that to matter. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=834.5999999999999s)]
*  He wants only him and Elon Musk to decide what matters. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=839.18s)]
*  No Congress, no judges, no anything. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=843.4599999999999s)]
*  And so that's what we're seeing. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=845.9599999999999s)]
*  And as you said, Maz Marco Rubio, he's totally in now on this whole thing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=847.2800000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you'd asked him five years ago if he would have thought that any of this [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  is acceptable, but this is the price for his position. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  He wants some power. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=859.72s)]
*  So if that means that you don't have rights anymore, he's totally fine with that as he's [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=861.08s)]
*  gonna demonstrate in this clip. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=864.0400000000001s)]
*  I might be more than 300 at this point. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=865.2800000000001s)]
*  We do it every day. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=867.0s)]
*  Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=868.0s)]
*  You're saying it could be more than 300. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=870.44s)]
*  Sure, I mean, at some point I hope we run out because we've gotten rid of all of them. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  We're looking every day. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=877.64s)]
*  They're looking every day. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=879.04s)]
*  And let me just say, I imagine, look, I'm like Brian Kilmeade. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=880.3599999999999s)]
*  Maybe I deserve millions of dollars a year. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=884.0s)]
*  I imagine that if they had found evidence that any of those 300 had committed actual [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=886.16s)]
*  crimes, done horrible things, or even posted horrible things, really scary, triggering [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=893.16s)]
*  language, they would cite it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=898.7199999999999s)]
*  They would cite some evidence, some act, something criminal, destruction, assault, hate speech. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=901.28s)]
*  What do we got? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=908.32s)]
*  Buccus, we got literally nothing. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=909.32s)]
*  The most they can say is there was an op-ed, doesn't even mention Hamas. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=910.84s)]
*  But still, you're affiliated or whatever with the organization that you didn't even talk [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=914.84s)]
*  about in that op-ed. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=917.6800000000001s)]
*  And once we've weeded out all of them, the people that we disagree with, the people who [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=919.84s)]
*  are exercising their speech and saying politically incorrect things, those who need to be canceled [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=924.86s)]
*  in the most ultimate, potentially fatal for some of them way, well, then he'll finally [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=931.06s)]
*  stop, I guess. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=935.5s)]
*  And maybe that's 300, maybe that's 3,000, 30,000. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=936.5s)]
*  I don't know how many foreign born students there are. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=938.5s)]
*  Maybe eventually they'll work through all of them. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=941.14s)]
*  But that's what Marco Rubio is now totally on board for. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=943.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=946.54s)]
*  So one of the most scary parts of this story and important parts of the story is that from [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=947.54s)]
*  time to time, they ignore the courts. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=954.9s)]
*  They're doing trial tests, like what if we ignore the courts for 24 hours? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=957.08s)]
*  What if we ignore them when they give a verbal order and not a written order? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=961.72s)]
*  What if we just delay telling them for a long time? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=966.5400000000001s)]
*  So the reason we were saying they made them disappear into a black site in Louisiana is [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=969.76s)]
*  because in the beginning, the judge told them, where did you take Mahmoud Halil? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=974.5200000000001s)]
*  And they're like, I'm not gonna tell you. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=978.12s)]
*  What do you mean you're not gonna tell me? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=979.12s)]
*  No, you're gonna tell me. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=981.08s)]
*  So eventually we found out that it was a prison in Jenna, Louisiana, and presumably they took [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=982.56s)]
*  her there as well. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=987.42s)]
*  But we had to drag that out of them. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=989.1999999999999s)]
*  And then in this case, they told the judge said, do not bring her to Jenna, Louisiana. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=990.9399999999999s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, we're gonna do it anyway, who cares? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=995.7199999999999s)]
*  And it started with the gang members that they were taking to El Salvador when they [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=998.5999999999999s)]
*  ignored that order, turned the plane around, don't take him there, the court told them. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1002.54s)]
*  Now that plane was filled with a lot of terrible gang members. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1006.5999999999999s)]
*  And so people are like, good, the gang members, by the way, it turns out there's at least, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1010.1s)]
*  it appears one innocent person there who is a hair and makeup artist. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1015.0600000000001s)]
*  Oops, but he's being tortured right now in El Salvador. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1021.14s)]
*  And he got there because the Trump administration ignored court orders. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1024.58s)]
*  Do you know what happens when they set that precedent as they've done now three times? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1028.56s)]
*  It doesn't apply to just people with student visas, it applies to all of us. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1033.42s)]
*  All Americans, I told you they're gonna chip away at all of our rights. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1037.84s)]
*  So once you start ignoring court orders, what if the court gives an order about an American? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1040.58s)]
*  You could ignore that too. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1044.62s)]
*  Of course, or residents that are here legally, etc. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1046.74s)]
*  And to Rubio, no, John, I think he loves this. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1050.74s)]
*  I think he was waiting to serve Israel his whole life. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1054.9399999999998s)]
*  He's been serving them in the Senate, couldn't wait to serve them as Secretary of State. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1058.34s)]
*  He's like, now I get to round up people on behalf of one of my largest donors. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1062.1s)]
*  These guys, remember, these guys don't serve Israel. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1066.9s)]
*  They serve their donors, no matter who the donor is. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1069.9s)]
*  Musk is a donor, let's bring out the Teslas in front of the White House. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1073.3400000000001s)]
*  Or by the way, if you're Joe Biden and you got some donors that make chips, hey, let's [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1076.74s)]
*  pass the Chips Act, there's $50 billion to you guys. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1081.22s)]
*  Hey, you got donors who are drug companies, yeah, you know what? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1083.74s)]
*  We won't even negotiate drug prices. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1087.0600000000002s)]
*  You set whatever price you like and bankrupt hundreds of millions of Americans. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1088.66s)]
*  Biden loves it, Bush loves it, Trump loves it. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1093.9s)]
*  Rubio loves it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1096.26s)]
*  So it's just supporters of Israel happen to be giant donors in this country. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1097.42s)]
*  So Rubio's like, my donor, yes, who would you want me to arrest? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1101.32s)]
*  Do you think he wouldn't arrest someone for Lockheed Martin or Exxon Mobil or Pfizer? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1104.14s)]
*  He'd arrest people for that in a second. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1108.78s)]
*  He'll do anything his donors tell him to do because the Supreme Court legalized bribery. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1110.98s)]
*  And what does that do? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1115.5s)]
*  It doesn't take away rights for some people. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1116.66s)]
*  It takes away all of our rights for all of us, okay? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1119.4s)]
*  And finally, Moz said, soon they'll be saying, hey, you said something against Jesus, you [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1124.12s)]
*  said something against America and round you up. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1130.1599999999999s)]
*  Isn't it amazing that Israel was above Jesus in America? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1133.28s)]
*  The first thing, they come for you first because you went after the most important thing in [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1138.8s)]
*  America, golden Israel, Israel above all. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1145.8s)]
*  It reminds me of a joke that you do, Moz, on your routine, you did a long time ago. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1153.84s)]
*  It was actually one of my favorite jokes of all time. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1157.8s)]
*  When you went to the Middle East, people criticized you for doing comedy tour there, you come [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1160.1200000000001s)]
*  back. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1165.6s)]
*  I mean, you did the joke about, if I criticize Allah, God there, they take me off the stage, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1166.6s)]
*  you're right. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1172.96s)]
*  And here, if I'm doing a show for Comedy Central and I criticize Tide, which is one of their [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1174.04s)]
*  sponsors, they take me off stage. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1178.3600000000001s)]
*  So you know what that means, Tide is God. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1180.64s)]
*  That was Moz's original joke, but now replace Tide with Israel. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1183.3200000000002s)]
*  Because in Iran, you'll get taken off the stage if you criticize God. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1188.04s)]
*  Here in America, you'll get taken off the streets if you criticize Israel. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1191.44s)]
*  So Israel is our politician's God. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1194.78s)]
*  Absolutely, and just to put a little button on that as well, the hypocrisy of Rubio saying [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1197.72s)]
*  we're getting rid of all these lunatics. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1204.6000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the people who stormed the Capitol on January 6th, many who were lunatics were [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1206.76s)]
*  set free. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1214.08s)]
*  They are actually people who actually threatened American democracy. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1215.4s)]
*  They have been set free. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1220.6s)]
*  And these other people who have just simply written an op-ed piece or expressed their [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1222.24s)]
*  opposition to the war in Gaza, they are being arrested. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1229.16s)]
*  And again, if you have real proof of them having done some violence or some sort, then [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1232.76s)]
*  bring it and let's proceed. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1237.16s)]
*  But they have not. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1239.84s)]
*  They've just said, I imagine there's more reason to this. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1240.84s)]
*  Yeah, okay, super last thing, because that's such a good point. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1243.68s)]
*  So for whatever it's worth, and my friends don't represent everybody, but this is my [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1247.3s)]
*  anecdote. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1251.52s)]
*  Every Jewish friend I know is horrified by this, right? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1253.06s)]
*  So what are you doing? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1256.24s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1258.52s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1259.52s)]
*  This is totally nuts, right? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1260.52s)]
*  Don't do this. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1261.52s)]
*  So remember, the original reason was we're combating anti-Semitism. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1263.4s)]
*  And anti-Semitism is free speech, but not anymore, because etc. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1268.52s)]
*  But we're worried about, not about Israel, no, no, no, it's about anti-Semitism. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1272.76s)]
*  But now, I think a huge percentage of Jewish Americans are objecting, right? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYEUXUhSRE&t=1276.92s)]
