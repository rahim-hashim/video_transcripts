"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R‚ÄìGA) raged that Fox News host Mark Levin ‚Äúshould be fired‚Äù for posting what she described as an ‚Äúextremely sick and disturbing‚Äù tweet calling her ‚Äústupid‚Äù as the MAGA fallout over President Donald Trump‚Äôs Iran stance continues.
The pair have sparred in the past week over whether the U.S. should militarily intervene in Israel‚Äôs conflict with Iran. Greene found herself siding with MAGA firebrands Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon pushing against involvement, while Levin and other Fox News hosts, including Sean Hannity, backed the idea of intervention."

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# MTG And Mark Levin DEBASE Each Other Over Iran
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU)
*  Marjorie Teller-Green has to be one of the dumbest people to ever serve in the House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=0.0s)]
*  of Representatives. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=5.2s)]
*  The stupidity that comes out of that woman's mouth is hard to imagine. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=6.2s)]
*  I can't believe that Fox News allows one of their hosts to go around and call me names [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=10.36s)]
*  on his social media. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=16.2s)]
*  That is so unprofessional and it really speaks to what kind of media company Fox News is. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=17.72s)]
*  His screeching is absolutely unbearable, but I think Fox News needs to reel him in. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=24.42s)]
*  I think his screeching is hilarious and I sometimes watch for comedic effect, honestly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=32.06s)]
*  But who you just heard from is Representative Marjorie Taylor-Green, a Republican Congresswoman. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=37.46s)]
*  Speaking about Mark Levin, a neocon who has never met a war, especially in the Middle [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=43.1s)]
*  East that he didn't love and has been pushing for a regime change war in Iran on behalf [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=48.7s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=54.38s)]
*  Now this right wing feuding continues, this time between Warhawk Mark Levin and Magadarling [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=55.38s)]
*  Marjorie Green. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=62.22s)]
*  And their battle is reaching a fever pitch, this week especially, as you have Mark Levin [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=63.34s)]
*  agitating for this ongoing war in Iran and Green calling for peace. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=71.54s)]
*  So on Matt Gaetz's show, Green pressed Fox News to basically reel in Levin after he called [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=76.58s)]
*  her a shameless nitwit for opposing bombing Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=86.62s)]
*  And as we'll get into shortly, Levin also would love for the war to expand beyond just [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=93.1s)]
*  bombing nuclear facilities. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=98.66s)]
*  Levin also argued that the MTG Gaetz Carlson side of the party was more representative [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=100.78s)]
*  of MAGA as a whole, so take a look. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=107.54s)]
*  What is your reaction to Mark Levin saying we aren't real MAGA because we don't want [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=110.9s)]
*  a regime change war in Iran? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=115.48s)]
*  He was a never Trumper from the beginning. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  He hated Donald Trump. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=119.3s)]
*  He was totally against him and tried to stop him from becoming president. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=120.98s)]
*  But yet now somehow Mark Levin is the voice of MAGA. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=124.94s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=128.7s)]
*  You and I, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, all of us that have been fighting hard to stay [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=130.34s)]
*  on these America first policies and stay out of foreign wars, we're MAGA. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=135.62s)]
*  We're the voice of MAGA and the people totally agree with us. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=140.86s)]
*  So it doesn't matter what Mark Levin actually has to say. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=145.18s)]
*  People don't watch his show. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't know anyone that watches his show. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=150.94s)]
*  Again, some people do watch to laugh at him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=155.62s)]
*  But Levin did not take kindly to what Marjorie Taylor Greene had to say there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=158.1s)]
*  He writes on X, MTG, God, you were stupid. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=161.82s)]
*  And you keep banging your head against the wall. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=164.9s)]
*  Thankfully, the President of the United States ignored you and hit the Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=167.78s)]
*  You seem very upset about it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=172.9s)]
*  I'm not going away. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=174.58s)]
*  You're on my radar. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  To which Greene responded, this is extremely sick and disturbing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  Please read to the end. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=182.22s)]
*  Mark, you have the exact same tone and language that the psychopaths use that send me death [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=184.38s)]
*  threats every single day. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=190.66s)]
*  You should be fired from Fox News and shame on Fox if they condone this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=192.66s)]
*  I am for peace. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  I oppose war, including wars, Israel wages. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=197.82s)]
*  Should I feel that my life is in danger now too? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=201.78s)]
*  What about President Trump, who strongly rebuked Israel this morning for continuing to attack [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=204.94s)]
*  Iran? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  And Marjorie Taylor Greene is right about one thing, Levin isn't about peace. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=212.22s)]
*  And Tucker Carlson, by the way, exposed something pretty interesting about him on his podcast [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=216.58s)]
*  recently. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=221.5s)]
*  Let's take a quick look at that, and then we'll go to Cenk. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=222.5s)]
*  Nobody's dragging us into anything. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=225.62s)]
*  It's not the Jews, it's not Israel again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=227.22s)]
*  No. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=231.3s)]
*  Long range, intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads are for you and me and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  your children and your grandchildren. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=241.02s)]
*  That's what's airing on Fox. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=243.22s)]
*  By the way, that same person, Mark Levin, who was a totally minor player in Fox World [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=245.02s)]
*  up until recently, I can tell you firsthand, suggested today that we send nuclear weapons [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=250.66000000000003s)]
*  to Ukraine too. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=257.08s)]
*  And I should just make it clear, in the last clip that we played, he said, intercontinental [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=258.08s)]
*  ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads are meant for you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=265.04s)]
*  They're gonna kill you, the mullahs. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=268.14s)]
*  Iran doesn't have intercontinental ballistic missiles, it doesn't have nuclear warheads. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=271.41999999999996s)]
*  All of this is, it's deranged. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=275.9s)]
*  Yeah, pretty deranged. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=279.38s)]
*  You know what else is deranged? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=282.62s)]
*  Pretending that they are not disagreeing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=283.86s)]
*  A lot of people on the left say there's no disagreement. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=287.3s)]
*  No, disagreement's real, it is. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's obviously real. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=291.94s)]
*  It's the most, it appears Morgan just did a whole episode on the split in the Maggard [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=293.42s)]
*  Coalition. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=298.14000000000004s)]
*  But if you listen to other shows, they'll tell you, don't believe your lying eyes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=299.26s)]
*  I don't know, well, some of them, not all of them, also told you that Joe Biden was [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=303.94s)]
*  young. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=307.26s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, no, there's clearly a huge split here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=308.26s)]
*  And this split's not difficult to ascertain, right? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=312.02000000000004s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=315.06s)]
*  The Israel first crowd always wants us to do whatever Israel wants, right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=316.62s)]
*  And Mark Levin is a despicable person on 100 different levels, including when he says, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=320.90000000000003s)]
*  it's against Israel, it's against the Jews. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=326.06s)]
*  No, no, don't conflate the two. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=328.62s)]
*  You're gonna drive up anti-Semitism, you schmuck. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=330.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=332.62s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=333.62s)]
*  No, nobody's saying anything against the Jews. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=334.62s)]
*  And as I've said a billion times, some of the best fighters for peace in America are [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=336.06s)]
*  Jewish Americans. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=340.3s)]
*  So this has nothing to do with the Jews. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=341.58000000000004s)]
*  But when you bring it in, you're ironically doing the anti-Semitic trope of all Jews have [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=342.74s)]
*  dual loyalty to Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=347.62s)]
*  No, brother, that's you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=349.02000000000004s)]
*  You're doing this on other Jews, okay? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=350.54s)]
*  You're doing projection, cuz you would love to serve Israel. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=352.3s)]
*  So why don't you move to Israel and sit in Tel Aviv and tell us all these wonderful things? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=356.02000000000004s)]
*  But leave my Jewish friends and family out of this, okay? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=360.70000000000005s)]
*  You got no right to talk about them like that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=363.42s)]
*  Okay, so now we go to Tucker and he, I was writing it down as he said it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=365.5s)]
*  Wait, Iran doesn't have intercontinental ballistic missiles or nukes or warheads. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=371.5s)]
*  So we're all about to get murdered by weapons they don't have. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=377.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=382.4s)]
*  Cuz this is, and now this is again, it's literal, it's not some sort of trope or anything. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=383.4s)]
*  Israel's leaders and predominantly Benjamin Netanyahu for the last 33 years is on tape [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=387.32s)]
*  saying they're gonna kill us all. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  Iran is gonna nuke America, America's in danger. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  Any minute now, any minute now, any minute now for 33 straight years. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=398.88s)]
*  So obviously Israel wanted us to attack Iran and Mark Levin wants us to do whatever Israel [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=402.5s)]
*  wants. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=408.52s)]
*  And Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene are saying something that's logical if you're [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=409.92s)]
*  a right winger. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=413.22s)]
*  When your movement is called America First, they're saying, wait, why don't we take care [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=414.58s)]
*  of America first and have a conversation about wait, does this help us or not help us? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=420.66s)]
*  How does it help us? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=425.86s)]
*  Let's just talk it through. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=427.36s)]
*  And that's when Mark Levin and all the Israel First guys jumping in. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=428.9s)]
*  In fact, I wanna just show you another perfect example of this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=437.34s)]
*  And look, oftentimes when we talk about the pro-war propaganda, it's usually in the context [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=440.53999999999996s)]
*  of Fox News. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=445.44s)]
*  And to be fair, Fox News has had wall to wall pro-war propaganda ever since the idea of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=446.44s)]
*  bombing Iran or doing a regime change war in Iran started. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=453.82s)]
*  With that in mind though, also consider that CNN likes to air this type of pro-war propaganda [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=457.6s)]
*  quite often as well. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=462.74s)]
*  And you're gonna get a little taste of it right here. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  The individual that you're gonna hear from is conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=466.88s)]
*  responding to Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=471.04s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=473.04s)]
*  She posted on X, it feels like a complete bait and switch to please the neocons, war [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=474.04s)]
*  grids, military industrial complex contracts and neocon TV personalities that MAGA hates [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=480.6s)]
*  and who were Trumpers. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's stupid. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, part of the thing is, what a month ago, Laura Loomer purged the last alleged [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=491.68s)]
*  neocons from the White House. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=498.6s)]
*  There are no neocons, whatever she thinks a neocon is, other than some sort of perfidious [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=500.20000000000005s)]
*  bagel-snarfing warmonger. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  There are none in the White House, right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=506.70000000000005s)]
*  They've all been purged. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=508.16s)]
*  Anyone who's suspected of neocon, of being a neocon has been purged. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=509.16s)]
*  This isn't the Nikki Haley people making these calls. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=512.96s)]
*  This is Trump and his team doing this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=515.38s)]
*  Okay, so Jonah Goldberg is playing dumb because as we know and as we've seen through her posts [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=518.58s)]
*  on X, Laura Loomer is a neocon and loves neocons and lied about the fact that she has a problem [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=524.06s)]
*  with neocons and got Trump to purge them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=531.42s)]
*  If you remember, we were skeptical about that whole narrative, right? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=533.7s)]
*  But at the same time, who serves in Trump's administration, I've learned doesn't actually [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=538.86s)]
*  matter. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=544.26s)]
*  What matters is who spoke to Trump last. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=545.26s)]
*  Because remember, remember Trump had dinner or lunch, I can't remember, doesn't matter. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=548.54s)]
*  He met with Mark Levin right before he started making really bad decisions in the Middle [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=553.86s)]
*  East. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=558.86s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=559.86s)]
*  So no, that was hilarious because they read a quote about neocon TV personalities. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=560.86s)]
*  And then a neocon TV personality comes out and says there are no neocons. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=566.54s)]
*  And there are none in the White House. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=571.04s)]
*  And there are none in the White House, why? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=573.46s)]
*  Because Laura Loomer purged them. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=575.4200000000001s)]
*  Laura Loomer is a neocon. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=577.4200000000001s)]
*  She's real first. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=579.4200000000001s)]
*  100%. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=581.4200000000001s)]
*  So he's, I mean, what a hilarious liar Jonah Goldberg is. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=582.4200000000001s)]
*  I watched the rest of it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=586.7s)]
*  Then he went on to say, you know what? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=588.1s)]
*  I normally disagree with Trump, but this strike against Iran was a really good idea. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=589.74s)]
*  So really, now that he did something Israel wants, a neocon TV personality like you decided [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=595.4200000000001s)]
*  that you all of a sudden like Donald Trump. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=602.86s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=604.94s)]
*  Funny how that works against Israel's interest. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=605.94s)]
*  Terrible, I can't stand him in favor of Israel's interest. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=608.58s)]
*  Donald Trump is so good. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=614.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=615.46s)]
*  There are no neocons. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=616.46s)]
*  So let's do Jonah Goldberg a favor, okay? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=617.46s)]
*  You're about to hear from Mark Levin, the guy who met with Trump right before Trump decided [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=620.9000000000001s)]
*  to engage in this conflict with Iran. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=626.1400000000001s)]
*  So Levin not so happy about the ceasefire that was reached between Israel and Iran recently. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=630.62s)]
*  In fact, why don't we hear what he had to say? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=637.18s)]
*  I hate this word ceasefire. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=640.18s)]
*  I really do. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=641.38s)]
*  The president hated it a few days ago too. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=642.38s)]
*  What's needed now is this in my humble opinion. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=644.54s)]
*  Iran should be forced to sign a surrender document, unconditional surrender. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=647.46s)]
*  They lost their nukes. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=653.34s)]
*  They've lost their air force. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=654.34s)]
*  They have no ground to air protection. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=655.54s)]
*  China didn't step in. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=657.82s)]
*  Russia didn't step in. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=658.86s)]
*  Not a single Arab country stepped in. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=659.98s)]
*  The supreme Nazi is hiding in a bunker much like Adolf Hitler did. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=662.26s)]
*  Adolf Hitler wasn't thrown a lifeline. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=666.9s)]
*  He was going to be killed, so he committed suicide. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=668.58s)]
*  So he hates the word ceasefire. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=674.5s)]
*  He loves war, very, very upset. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=676.54s)]
*  He's like- There are no neocons. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=679.4200000000001s)]
*  There are no neocons. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=680.58s)]
*  And there are no neocons on TV or radio either apparently. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=681.7s)]
*  I mean, look, that was hilarious in a couple of ways. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=685.22s)]
*  So first of all, he says- They should be forced into an unconditional [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=687.74s)]
*  surrender. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=690.9000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so obviously they're never going to agree to that. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=691.9000000000001s)]
*  And hence permanent war. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=695.86s)]
*  That means you have to have ground troops for them to unconditionally surrender. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=697.82s)]
*  You have to find the Nazi in his bunker. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=701.58s)]
*  And so you have to go in with American troops. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=704.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=707.4200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=708.4200000000001s)]
*  Okay, hey, why doesn't Israel go in with their troops? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=709.4200000000001s)]
*  That's anti-Semitic. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=711.1400000000001s)]
*  Now you can't have Israelis dying. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=712.1400000000001s)]
*  Israelis are worth a thousand, ten thousand, a million American, I mean Arab, I mean lives. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=714.9s)]
*  Okay, yeah, that's what I thought, Mark. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=720.18s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=721.98s)]
*  No, you want us to fight this war for you. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=722.98s)]
*  So the minute that Trump does a ceasefire, remember this is same Mark Levin for the last [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=724.86s)]
*  couple of days as Trump did the bombing was like- [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=729.02s)]
*  You have to listen to what Trump says. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=731.06s)]
*  Trump is MAGA. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=732.98s)]
*  Trump defines MAGA. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=733.98s)]
*  Trump is American bird. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=734.98s)]
*  And you have to listen to Trump. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=735.98s)]
*  The minute Trump says ceasefire, don't listen to Trump. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=738.22s)]
*  Listen to Israel instead. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=740.9399999999999s)]
*  We got him, Mark. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=742.9399999999999s)]
*  We got it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=743.94s)]
*  For God's sake, move to Tel Aviv where you'll be happy, they'll be happy, everybody will [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=744.94s)]
*  be happy. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=748.3000000000001s)]
*  Look, to say that Jews have dual loyalties, absurd, absurd. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=749.6600000000001s)]
*  John Stewart talked about it the other day. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=755.58s)]
*  He's like, I have loyalty to Jersey. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=757.3000000000001s)]
*  That's where I grew up. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=760.3000000000001s)]
*  That's my homeland, right? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=761.3000000000001s)]
*  I feel the same way, right? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=762.3000000000001s)]
*  And our ethnic backgrounds are different. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=764.7s)]
*  Our cultural backgrounds are the same because we both grew up in New Jersey, right? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=766.86s)]
*  But for guys like Mark, they can't understand that because they do have dual loyalty. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=770.62s)]
*  And they think following Israel's orders is paramount, paramount. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=775.1800000000001s)]
*  Look, you're allowed to have that opinion and I'm sure there's some Norwegian Americans [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=780.02s)]
*  who think Norway's more important than America. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=784.9000000000001s)]
*  Norway's doing well, okay? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=787.14s)]
*  It happens, it happens. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=788.14s)]
*  Norway doesn't need any help, okay? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=789.14s)]
*  Don't judge anybody else based on Mark Levin's comments or actions. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=791.14s)]
*  But he definitely is not anywhere near America first. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=794.62s)]
*  And lastly, CNN, at least for now, CNN is the one who brought on Jonah Goldberg. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=798.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=804.62s)]
*  I just wanted to, yeah, Jonah Goldberg, Mark Levin, etc. are neocons, I get it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=805.62s)]
*  But CNN doesn't label him a neocon. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=809.78s)]
*  They let him pretend as if he's objective and then says this absurd Trumpian type of [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=812.14s)]
*  thing where he says there are no neocons. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=818.42s)]
*  And CNN doesn't challenge him at all because CNN is kind of neocon. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=821.02s)]
*  That's why they're playing around with their polls. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=826.2199999999999s)]
*  That's why all of a sudden they've got breaking news. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=828.34s)]
*  We did not destroy the nuclear facilities. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=831.34s)]
*  We have to go back in for more. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=833.58s)]
*  This is the same CNN that drove us into the Iraq war. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=835.14s)]
*  Abby Phillips' show, which is the prime time slot, is performing really well. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=839.9s)]
*  And I don't think that's an accident. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=844.4200000000001s)]
*  I think it's performing well because she consistently has a panel of diverse opinions debating each [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=845.46s)]
*  other each night. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=852.6s)]
*  And so- [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=853.6s)]
*  I'm shocked they let her do that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=854.6s)]
*  I love it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=855.7800000000001s)]
*  It's the most interesting show on CNN. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=856.78s)]
*  It is, it just is. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=858.3s)]
*  Yeah, because you're at least exchanging opinions. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=859.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=861.74s)]
*  Every once in a while a progressive sneaks on there or a populist sneaks on there. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=862.74s)]
*  A populist sneaking onto CNN is unheard of. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=865.66s)]
*  They generally speaking, they despise populists and they don't know that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=869.26s)]
*  They just think like, they don't have credibility. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=873.14s)]
*  They don't have elite status. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=877.02s)]
*  Please go away. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=878.8199999999999s)]
*  A neocon, you have such elite status. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=879.8199999999999s)]
*  Really, do they? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=881.9s)]
*  How did they earn it? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=882.9s)]
*  Did you know that Jonah Goldberg was part of a magazine that sold to 87 or maybe 88 [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=884.3s)]
*  different people? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=888.8599999999999s)]
*  Everyone online has audiences a thousand times, a million times larger than Bill Kristol, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=891.18s)]
*  Jonah Goldberg or any of these neocons. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=897.78s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=900.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they have credibility according to CNN. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=901.3399999999999s)]
*  But hey, at least they do a one show. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k483N_IouDU&t=903.02s)]
