# Jeff Bezos Is NOT WELCOME In Venice
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk)
*  It's one of the most romantic cities in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=0.0s)]
*  So it's no wonder why Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=3.68s)]
*  Lauren Sanchez chose the Italian Lagoon City for their mega wedding. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=7.16s)]
*  But when the star studded celebrations kick off in Venice this week, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=11.94s)]
*  not everyone in the city is so supported. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=15.9s)]
*  Greenpeace activists displayed a large banner in the famous St. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Mark's Square on Monday, while a group of frustrated locals have threatened to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=22.1s)]
*  disrupt the couple's big day any way they can. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=26.34s)]
*  Look, a lot of these fancy European cities that people from around the world [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=31.0s)]
*  like to travel to have kind of gotten under the skin of locals. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=36.28s)]
*  Because I'm sure it's annoying to have this massive influx of tourists come in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=40.96s)]
*  and take up all this space. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=45.92s)]
*  But it becomes even more aggravating when you're talking about one of the richest [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  men on the planet, Jeff Bezos, deciding to have his wedding in Venice. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=52.72s)]
*  And of course, that's been met with a lot of protests. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=57.28s)]
*  So Greenpeace and a group of Venetian activists dubbed No Space for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=59.76s)]
*  Bezos have launched a multitude of protests against the couple. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  Because they say that Venice is already being overrun by tourists and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=68.8s)]
*  other billionaires. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=73.08s)]
*  So we want to send, I should say, a very clear message. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=75.44s)]
*  The ones who should be ashamed are them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=80.72s)]
*  They are the people who have destroyed this city, and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  that was a quote from one of the protesters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=86.4s)]
*  Now, Venice's two square mile main island and historic center, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=88.84s)]
*  home to about 50,000 people, receives about 20 million visitors yearly. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=93.28s)]
*  Mostly day trippers from cruise ships or other cities. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=98.28s)]
*  And while tourism is central to Venice's economy and cultural identity, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  critics are arguing that it has displaced residents and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=108.2s)]
*  damaged some historical sites as well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=112.28s)]
*  If you guys can recall, last summer we did a story similar to this that had to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=115.84s)]
*  do with protesters, locals who were protesting in Barcelona, Spain. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=121.28s)]
*  But we reported on those protests and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=126.36s)]
*  I want to give you a little taste of what we had to say, let's watch. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  A water fight on the streets of Barcelona. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=133.04s)]
*  Some locals spraying tourists with water guns as they ate at popular restaurants, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=135.96s)]
*  sending visitors fleeing from their tables. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=140.8s)]
*  Thousands of protesters walking through the city over the weekend, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=143.04s)]
*  chanting tourists go home and carrying signs with anti-tourist slogans. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  Those protests were taking place right before I went to Barcelona and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  I was happy to report that there were no protests happening when I was there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=159.12s)]
*  But I literally did consider not going because who wants to spend thousands of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=162.92s)]
*  dollars to visit a city where you're not wanted? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  But in the case of Venice, the Bezos, they're not wanted, okay? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=169.44s)]
*  So the protests that took place over the last few days in Venice were interesting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  So in the video that we showed at the beginning of the story, Cenk, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=179.12s)]
*  there was this big sign that was unfurled. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=182.96s)]
*  Take a look at it, it says, if you can rent Venice for [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=186.08s)]
*  your wedding, you can pay more taxes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=189.88s)]
*  So there's obviously a lot of political commentary associated with these protests. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=194.08s)]
*  And the No Space for Bezos group also threatened to flood the canals with [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=198.8s)]
*  inflatable crocodiles to block the guests from arriving. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  And it looks like it's worked. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  Apparently they've decided to move their post-wedding celebration [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  to a different location. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  And so, look, the protesters believe that the reason why they [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  moved the after party is because of their protests. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=219.84s)]
*  Others are arguing it's a different reason, who knows, who cares? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=224.56s)]
*  But what are your thoughts? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=227.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think that there's a really good political point in here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  And I think it's best made by Warren Gunnels, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=232.55999999999997s)]
*  he's the policy director for Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  And he wrote, this is what oligarchy looks like. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=236.72s)]
*  Jeff Bezos, the third richest man in the world with $231 billion, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=240.04s)]
*  can afford to sail into Venice on his $500 million yacht for [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  his $20 million three-day wedding to give his bride a $5 million ring. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=249.2s)]
*  Because his real tax rate is 1.1% tax to rich. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=260.0s)]
*  Look, I don't begrudge him the money that he's made. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=262.0s)]
*  I'm not in that camp. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=264.36s)]
*  I'm not in the camp of there shouldn't be billionaires and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=266.0s)]
*  we should eat the rich, okay? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=268.32s)]
*  But I am in the camp of why the F does he only have to pay 1% [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=269.64s)]
*  in effective tax rate when the rest of us in the middle class pay [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=273.52s)]
*  a ton of taxes and then this guy gets to live spectacularly, no problem. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=277.96s)]
*  As long as you pay your god damn taxes and they don't. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=283.44s)]
*  So I would love a left wing populist in office one day that makes them [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=288.4s)]
*  actually pay their taxes. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=293.04s)]
*  Then they can have any goddamn wedding they like. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=294.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I love the political statements that are being made here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=298.92s)]
*  Now again, according to local press reports, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=302.56s)]
*  the venue switch was really over security concerns. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=304.6s)]
*  But maybe the security concerns have to do with the fact that there are protests [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=307.24s)]
*  against them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=310.52s)]
*  But they argue no, it's the war between Israel and Iran, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=311.68s)]
*  which isn't happening anymore. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  So the venue switch happening for that reason doesn't make much sense. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXQqCI4pxTk&t=323.32000000000005s)]
