*  President Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=8.92s)]
*  This is the first time since 1965 [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=9.56s)]
*  that a president has ordered troops [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=11.4s)]
*  in over the objections [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  of the governor. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=14.44s)]
*  This is a manufactured crisis. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=15.44s)]
*  Multiple vehicles set on fire, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  covered in graffiti, condemning ice. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=20.36s)]

*  patrol vehicle, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  which was then set on fire. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=28.68s)]
*  Many hundreds descending on [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  the 101 freeway, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=32.2s)]
*  blocking traffic in both directions. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=33.2s)]
*  Ice raids of local small businesses [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  in Los Angeles has unfortunately [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  led to growing unrest in the city, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=41.28s)]
*  with protests unfortunately [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=43.92s)]
*  escalating to riots over [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=46.2s)]
*  the last several days. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=48.08s)]
*  And now we're also learning that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  more than 500 Marines, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=52.72s)]
*  active duty Marines, are being [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=54.52s)]
*  used to respond to the riots in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=57.6s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  So this is according to ABC News. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=61.68s)]
*  This was reported today. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  The Marines are from the 2nd [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=65.0s)]
*  Battalion, 7th Marines at 29 Palms, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=67.04s)]
*  California, whom US Northern [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=70.04s)]
*  Command has said Sunday, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=72.34s)]
*  we're on a prepared to deploy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=74.4s)]
*  status if the Defense [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=76.6s)]
*  Department needed them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=78.36s)]
*  And I just want to understand what [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=80.6s)]
*  exactly the Trump administration [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=82.68s)]
*  thinks the Marines are supposed to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=84.8s)]
*  do against American citizens. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=86.92s)]
*  These are individuals in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=90.84s)]
*  the military who are trained to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=92.64s)]
*  kill, that is their role in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  the military. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=96.84s)]
*  And so I understand the concerns. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=98.68s)]
*  No one understands the concerns [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  better than I do when it has to do [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=102.88s)]
*  with the rioters, when it pertains [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  to riots. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=106.88s)]
*  And honestly, I'm incredibly [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=107.4s)]
*  frustrated by how things have [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=109.56s)]
*  unfolded in this situation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  But the idea that we should use [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=114.36s)]
*  Marines against Americans is [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=116.24s)]
*  unhinged. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=118.28s)]
*  And something tells me that Trump [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=119.08s)]
*  supporters would feel the same way [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  if we had a Democratic president or [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=123.72s)]
*  a Democratic administration [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=126.06s)]
*  threatening to do the same against [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=128.16s)]
*  Republican voters or Trump [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=130.6s)]
*  supporters as they engage in civil [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=132.6s)]
*  unrest. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=135.2s)]
*  So with that in mind, let's go back [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=136.12s)]
*  to the beginning and talk a little [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=138.72s)]
*  bit about how this all started, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  what's going on, how it unfolded. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=143.88s)]
*  Now, the Marines are expected to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  arrive over the next 24 hours. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  Hopefully, the worst that I have in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=149.96s)]
*  my mind right now doesn't come to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=152.24s)]
*  fruition. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=154.28s)]
*  But literally minutes before the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=155.84s)]
*  Marines deployment was confirmed, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump was asked if he plans [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=159.76s)]
*  on sending Marines to LA and he [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=161.76s)]
*  said, we'll see what happens. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=163.6s)]
*  And look, as I give you more [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  details about this entire [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=168.24s)]
*  situation, I just want you guys to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=169.68s)]
*  know one thing that I know without [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=171.68s)]
*  a shadow of a doubt. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump wants this fight because the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=174.88s)]
*  one area in which he is still [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=177.64s)]
*  popular, still popular, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  is his immigration policies. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=181.92s)]
*  And so for anyone on the left who [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=185.68s)]
*  thinks this is good optics for us, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=188.0s)]
*  it's not. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=190.6s)]
*  And I want to explain why. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=191.84s)]
*  I want to explain how you can fight [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=193.8s)]
*  back against mothers being ripped [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=196.16s)]
*  away from their kids. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=198.64s)]
*  You can fight back against home [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  depot day laborers, day laborers [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  waiting outside in home depot [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=204.92s)]
*  parking lots, getting arrested. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  You can speak out against that and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=210.0s)]
*  effectively strategize in a way [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  that helps people see what's going [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  on, but that's not what's happening [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=216.92s)]
*  right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=219.32s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  how this all started. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  So these protests began on Friday [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=223.28s)]
*  night following reports indicating [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=225.48s)]
*  that ICE agents were targeting [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=227.88s)]
*  undocumented immigrants in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  various rates. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=231.68s)]
*  Now one was in the downtown Los [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=233.08s)]
*  Angeles fashion district. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=235.32s)]
*  There was a dress shop that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  allegedly had undocumented [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  immigrants working in it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=241.88s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=244.48000000000002s)]

*  But obviously that led to a lot of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=256.44s)]

*  Why would that happen even if they [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  are undocumented? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=262.36s)]

*  laziest and most pathetic ways at [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=287.08s)]
*  targeting undocumented immigrants [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=289.72s)]
*  in this country. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=291.88s)]
*  Look, if we and we do, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=292.76s)]
*  we have millions of people with [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=294.2s)]
*  undocumented status in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=296.2s)]
*  the United States. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=297.76s)]
*  Some of whom are actually [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=299.48s)]
*  committing crimes. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  I know lefties want to pretend like [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=302.64s)]

*  It does exist. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=304.72s)]
*  So I have no problem with ICE [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=305.64s)]
*  targeting those individuals. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  And to be sure, some of the people [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  that got arrested by ICE in Los [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=311.0s)]
*  Angeles over this weekend, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=312.72s)]
*  had been convicted of some pretty [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  heinous crimes, but not all of them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=316.24s)]
*  And Tom Homan, the border czar, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=318.84s)]
*  made abundantly clear, yeah, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=320.64s)]
*  there were definitely people who [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=322.23999999999995s)]
*  got arrested for deportation who [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=324.08s)]
*  hadn't committed any other crime [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=325.88s)]
*  other than being in the country [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=327.67999999999995s)]
*  without documented status. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=329.23999999999995s)]
*  They're in the country illegally. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=330.79999999999995s)]
*  Okay, so this all kind of began on [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  Friday, things started to escalate [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=334.88s)]
*  on Friday night. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=337.64s)]
*  Although on Friday night, for [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=338.88s)]
*  the most part, with a few [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=341.0s)]
*  exceptions, things were under [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=342.67999999999995s)]
*  control, right? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  There were definitely some records, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  definitely some people looking to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=348.0s)]
*  cause problems. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=349.76s)]
*  But on Friday night, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=350.84s)]
*  there was no indication that things [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=352.08s)]
*  had kind of gotten so out of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  control that we would need [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=355.44s)]
*  the federal government to send in [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=356.96s)]
*  the National Guard to handle it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=358.88s)]
*  So now, again, ICE did release [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=361.12s)]
*  the names of some of the people [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=363.4s)]
*  that they've arrested, and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=365.79999999999995s)]
*  they detailed the crimes that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=368.12s)]
*  they've committed. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=370.4s)]
*  And so there's that, but remember, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=372.24s)]
*  they've arrested dozens of people [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  over the weekend. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=375.76s)]
*  So when you're releasing [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=376.64s)]
*  the names of like six, seven, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=377.96s)]
*  eight people that you arrested, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=379.64s)]
*  and there's proof or indication [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=381.44s)]
*  that they've committed other [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  violent crimes, that's fine. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=384.6s)]
*  But what about the dozens of other [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=386.76s)]
*  people you arrested? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=388.52s)]
*  And does it really make sense for [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=389.76s)]
*  us to use up resources in arresting [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=392.24s)]
*  day laborers at a Home Depot [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=394.96s)]
*  parking lot? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=397.12s)]
*  So I'll give you some of the names. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=399.04s)]
*  I want to be honest and fair, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=400.52s)]
*  right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=401.68s)]
*  Some of the people who arrested [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=402.2s)]
*  have committed some terrible [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=403.68s)]
*  crimes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=404.84s)]
*  There's one individual who's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=405.36s)]
*  a citizen of Vietnam. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=407.24s)]
*  His name is Chung Phan, 49. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=408.92s)]
*  Federal officials say he has [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=411.68s)]
*  a criminal history that includes [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  a second degree murder conviction [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=414.84s)]
*  that carried a sentence of 15 [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=416.68s)]
*  years to life. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=418.28s)]
*  So I mean, I would prefer for him [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=419.32s)]
*  to serve his full sentence and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=421.56s)]
*  then get deported. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=423.76s)]
*  It's unclear whether that has [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=425.64s)]
*  happened. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  You have Rolando Enriquez, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=427.76s)]
*  a citizen of the Philippines, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=429.32s)]
*  has a criminal history that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=430.88s)]
*  includes convictions for theft, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  assault, burglary, and rape, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=433.8s)]
*  according to the Department of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=435.32s)]
*  Homeland Security. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=436.92s)]
*  So these guys I've got no love for, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=437.52s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=439.2s)]
*  I know, I know, I'm supposed to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  care about all of these undocumented [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=441.48s)]
*  immigrants as if they're all [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=443.2s)]
*  the same. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=444.4s)]
*  No, they're not all the same, and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=444.92s)]
*  I want to be clear about that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=446.28s)]
*  Now since the Department of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=447.84s)]
*  Homeland Security did not provide [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=448.96s)]
*  any incriminating information about [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=450.48s)]
*  the dozens of others who got [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=452.32s)]
*  arrested, I'm just going to assume [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=453.68s)]
*  that they were just here with [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=455.68s)]
*  undocumented status and that gave [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=457.36s)]
*  them enough reason to round them up. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=459.56s)]
*  And that has really upset Angelinos. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=462.84s)]
*  Why would it upset Angelinos? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=465.2s)]
*  Because immigrants and yes, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=466.88s)]
*  undocumented immigrants, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=468.68s)]
*  make up a significant portion of [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=470.52s)]
*  the population in LA. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=472.48s)]
*  And you want to know something? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=473.92s)]
*  The vast majority of them are [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=475.44s)]
*  actually contributing to LA, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=477.4s)]
*  making LA a wonderful place, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=479.68s)]
*  not a bad place. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  And the fact that Trump is [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=483.56s)]
*  hyper-focused on Los Angeles, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=484.96s)]
*  which yes, is a sanctuary city, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=486.8s)]
*  is because he wants to have [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=488.68s)]
*  this fight. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=490.16s)]
*  He wants this to be the big [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=490.88s)]
*  distraction from what is a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=492.4s)]
*  disastrous budget bill that will [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=493.96s)]
*  add trillions of dollars to our [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  deficit. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  And he wants to lean into the one [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=498.76s)]
*  area where he still enjoys some [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=500.52s)]
*  favorability, some popularity. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=502.23999999999995s)]
*  So things started to really get [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=504.68s)]
*  unhinged in LA after Trump [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=507.08s)]
*  announced that he would be sending [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=509.24s)]
*  2,000 National Guard troops to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=511.88s)]
*  handle the riots. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=514.36s)]
*  Now at that point, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=516.36s)]
*  there was no indication that we [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=517.6s)]
*  needed National Guard troops. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  First of all, let me just remind [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=521.84s)]
*  you all that during the 2020 [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=523.76s)]
*  riots that took place in the summer [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=525.84s)]
*  of 2020, the then mayor, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=527.92s)]
*  Eric Garcetti, did request [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=529.56s)]
*  National Guard troops because our [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=531.36s)]
*  local law enforcement was unable [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=533.64s)]
*  to handle the sheer volume of [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=535.84s)]
*  rioters. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=537.84s)]
*  So he requested the help of 1,000 [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=538.64s)]
*  National Guard troops. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=541.28s)]
*  And remember, the summer of 2020, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=543.16s)]
*  the riots that took place in that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=545.84s)]
*  summer were far more widespread. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=548.16s)]
*  We're talking about, look, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=551.0s)]
*  there were obviously people [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=553.04s)]
*  like peaceful protesters. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=555.4s)]
*  I don't want to conflate them with [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=556.56s)]
*  the rioters, but the riots weren't [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=558.12s)]
*  just isolated in one or [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  two parts of LA. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=561.36s)]
*  They were all over the place. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=563.28s)]
*  They were in the San Fernando [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  Valley, they were downtown LA. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=566.52s)]
*  Everywhere you went, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=568.4s)]
*  there was looting, rioting, and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=569.7199999999999s)]
*  it was hard to get a handle on [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=571.64s)]
*  things. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  LA is a sprawling city, it's huge. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=573.7199999999999s)]
*  And so if you're watching these [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=577.1999999999999s)]
*  videos online, you might get [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=578.8s)]
*  the impression that there's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  rioting happening everywhere. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=581.92s)]
*  The entire city is dealing with [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=583.7199999999999s)]
*  riots, that's not true. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=585.9599999999999s)]
*  It is limited to isolated parts. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=587.88s)]
*  However, these riots have grown. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=590.1999999999999s)]
*  And last night was probably [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  the worst of it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  This continues to grow, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=596.56s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if it does [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=597.8s)]
*  continue to get worse. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=599.5999999999999s)]
*  And to be sure, LAPD Chief Jim [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  McDonald did weigh in on the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=603.04s)]
*  violence and how the department is [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=605.0s)]
*  pretty much unable to deal with it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=609.56s)]
*  It is violence that I've seen is [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=610.56s)]
*  disgusting. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=612.04s)]
*  It's escalated now since the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=612.76s)]
*  beginning of this incident. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=614.68s)]
*  What we saw the first night was [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=616.6s)]
*  bad, what we've seen subsequent to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=618.88s)]
*  that is getting increasingly worse [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=621.12s)]
*  and more violent. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=623.2s)]
*  Tonight we had individuals out [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=624.2s)]
*  there shooting commercial grade [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=626.04s)]
*  fireworks at our officers, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=628.04s)]
*  that can kill you. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=629.68s)]
*  And we have adapted our tactics to [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=630.84s)]
*  be able to have a chance to be [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=633.24s)]
*  able to take these people into [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=635.2s)]
*  custody and to be able to hold them [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=637.2s)]
*  accountable. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=639.48s)]
*  We are overwhelmed as far as [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=640.56s)]
*  the number of people out there [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=642.4s)]
*  engaged in this type of activity. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=644.24s)]
*  And the type of things that they're [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=646.52s)]
*  doing, they'll take backpacks and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=648.6s)]
*  the backpack will have a cinder [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=650.52s)]
*  block in it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=652.32s)]
*  They have a hammer and they'll [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=652.92s)]
*  break up the cinder block and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=654.52s)]
*  use that, pass it around to throw [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=656.02s)]
*  at officers, to throw at cars and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=657.76s)]
*  throw at other people. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=659.52s)]
*  Look, there's an abundance of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=660.84s)]
*  evidence to prove what the police [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=662.16s)]
*  chief is saying there. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  But clearly, as these riots have [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=664.72s)]
*  grown, it's become more difficult [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=666.64s)]
*  for the police department to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=668.6800000000001s)]
*  maintain order. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=670.32s)]
*  And that's what he's trying to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  talk about there. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=672.96s)]
*  But I want to reinforce what he's [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=673.6s)]
*  saying in regard to the violent [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=675.6s)]
*  acts by showing you this video. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=677.28s)]
*  This was when the protesters, or [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=679.28s)]
*  I shouldn't say protestors, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=680.88s)]
*  at this point rioters had taken [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=682.2s)]
*  control of the 101 freeway near [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=683.76s)]
*  downtown Los Angeles. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=685.32s)]
*  And you'll see exactly what I'm [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=687.32s)]
*  talking about. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=688.64s)]
*  Get down, get down. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=690.08s)]
*  Oh. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=692.6400000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=693.1600000000001s)]
*  So rocks, bricks, in that video [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=693.6600000000001s)]
*  that I just showed you, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=696.12s)]
*  a police officer gets hit in [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=698.2s)]
*  the head with either a rock or [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=700.48s)]
*  a crushed up cinder block that was [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=702.9200000000001s)]
*  thrown by someone on the freeway [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=705.88s)]
*  overpass, real classy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=708.76s)]
*  So they're playing right into [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=711.0s)]
*  the police department, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=713.08s)]
*  and they're trying to get [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=714.76s)]
*  people to come and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=716.32s)]
*  play right into what the Trump [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=717.48s)]
*  administration wants. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=719.48s)]
*  Let me be clear about that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=721.0s)]
*  So when these riots grow in size [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=722.6s)]
*  and scope, and you have a situation [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=725.2s)]
*  in which the police chief says, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=728.36s)]
*  we can't get a handle on this, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=731.12s)]
*  we're overwhelmed. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=733.6s)]
*  That's going to, in the minds of [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=735.32s)]
*  many Americans across the country, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=737.12s)]
*  and certainly the Trump [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=739.24s)]
*  administration, justify sending [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=740.72s)]
*  National Guard troops. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=742.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, so far, the National Guard [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=743.96s)]
*  have been focused on protecting [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=746.4s)]
*  federal agents from DHS and ICE as [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=748.36s)]
*  they carry out these raids. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=750.4799999999999s)]
*  But also protecting federal [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  buildings that were vandalized and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=754.9599999999999s)]
*  targeted by some of these rioters [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=757.52s)]
*  on the first two nights of these [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=759.9599999999999s)]
*  riots. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=762.28s)]
*  But what's really interesting is [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=764.12s)]
*  that while the police chief says [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=766.12s)]
*  that the police department is [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=768.04s)]
*  overwhelmed, and that doesn't [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=769.8399999999999s)]
*  surprise me, the police department [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=771.64s)]
*  has been dealing with severe [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=773.7199999999999s)]
*  violence for a few years now. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=775.28s)]
*  You have our mayor, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=776.92s)]
*  Karen Bass, saying something [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=777.8s)]
*  entirely different. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=779.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=780.0s)]
*  Given the point where it has [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=781.28s)]
*  escalated to, do you think [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=782.8s)]
*  the National Guard is needed now? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think the National [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=787.6s)]
*  Guard is needed now. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=789.16s)]
*  Things in LA are calm. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=790.72s)]
*  I will tell you that I'm saddened [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=792.24s)]
*  by the extent of the vandalism in [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=794.4s)]
*  the form of graffiti all through [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=796.6s)]
*  the downtown area. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=798.76s)]
*  But it is important for [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=800.04s)]
*  people to know that even in [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=801.72s)]
*  downtown, this is isolated to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=803.76s)]
*  a few streets. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=806.08s)]
*  This is not citywide civil unrest [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=807.1600000000001s)]
*  taking place in Los Angeles. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=809.48s)]
*  So she's right that this is not [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=812.6s)]
*  citywide civil unrest. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=814.76s)]
*  It is, at least for now, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=816.44s)]
*  isolated in a few parts of LA city. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=823.08s)]
*  Paramount California, which is part [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=823.9200000000001s)]
*  of LA County, is not considered [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=826.0400000000001s)]
*  part of LA city. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=827.88s)]
*  So that area is not an area that [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  Karen Bass has jurisdiction over. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=830.72s)]
*  But nonetheless, what she said at [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=833.12s)]
*  the very tail end of that is [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=835.08s)]
*  correct. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=836.5600000000001s)]
*  However, I will also say that [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=837.12s)]
*  current leadership in Los Angeles [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=839.44s)]
*  city, and I mean the city council [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=842.04s)]
*  and yes, Mayor Karen Bass, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=844.4s)]
*  is terrible. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=846.44s)]
*  And typically they don't have [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  a handle on anything at all. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=849.88s)]
*  We've been having street takeovers [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=852.2s)]
*  for I don't know several years now [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=854.44s)]
*  and they've been unable to control [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=856.52s)]
*  it. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=858.5600000000001s)]
*  The police department has been [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=859.08s)]
*  unable to control it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=860.88s)]
*  So the idea that the police [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=862.16s)]
*  department is going to be able to [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=863.9599999999999s)]
*  handle growing riots in this city [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=866.0799999999999s)]
*  without any help at all is a little [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=868.4s)]
*  ridiculous to me, and [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=870.64s)]
*  I'm just keeping it real. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=872.16s)]
*  Now, if the rioters are concerned [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=874.36s)]
*  about the feds coming in, I don't [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=876.52s)]
*  know, maybe I would reconsider [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=878.6s)]
*  rioting. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=880.36s)]
*  But the rioters should not be [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=881.0s)]
*  conflated with the protesters, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  the demonstrators, the people who [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=884.16s)]
*  want to peacefully assemble and [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=885.92s)]
*  speak out against what ICE is doing. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=887.56s)]

*  unfortunately, those are also [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=891.28s)]
*  the very people who end up getting [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=893.12s)]
*  conflated with the wreckers, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=895.08s)]
*  who I would venture to say don't [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=896.92s)]

*  Okay, I live in the city. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=901.6800000000001s)]
*  These are the same people who love [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=903.32s)]
*  the chaos and have been engaging in [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=905.28s)]

*  They love it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=909.4s)]
*  Any excuse to burn cars, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=910.08s)]

*  do street takeovers and do donuts, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=914.24s)]

*  officers. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=919.2s)]
*  Now, you want to know what happens? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=920.0s)]
*  The more that grows, the more [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=921.36s)]
*  justification the Trump [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=923.24s)]

*  federal agents and national guard [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=926.92s)]
*  troops. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=929.52s)]
*  I do not think there's ever any [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=930.72s)]
*  legitimate reason to use the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=932.72s)]
*  American military against American [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=934.64s)]
*  people, but that appears to be what [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=937.12s)]
*  the Trump administration is poised [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=939.36s)]

*  Now, I want to also just briefly [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=943.6s)]
*  comment on what we've seen in [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=945.36s)]
*  regard to police conduct, because [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=947.16s)]
*  police conduct has been just [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=949.24s)]
*  unacceptable, illegal, disgusting. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  I'll give you a specific example [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=954.6400000000001s)]
*  involving an Australian journalist. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=956.6400000000001s)]
*  There's video of a police officer [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=959.0s)]
*  very intentionally shooting [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=961.2800000000001s)]
*  a rubber bullet at an Australian [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=963.24s)]

*  wrong. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=967.2800000000001s)]
*  If you don't believe me, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=967.8000000000001s)]
*  take a look at this. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=969.0400000000001s)]
*  You just shot the front. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=971.04s)]
*  You okay? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=974.1999999999999s)]
*  You good? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=974.92s)]
*  You okay? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=975.68s)]
*  You okay? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=976.4399999999999s)]
*  You okay? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  You okay? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=978.12s)]
*  Hey. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=979.12s)]
*  Disgusting, absolutely disgusting. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=980.5999999999999s)]
*  I want to show you some still [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=982.4s)]
*  frames so you can see what [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=983.48s)]
*  I'm talking about here. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=984.4399999999999s)]
*  I know that was a quick video. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=985.36s)]
*  So if you look at the police [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=986.4399999999999s)]
*  officer, he's at the very edge on [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=988.64s)]
*  the left-hand side of the photo. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=991.4s)]
*  That's the one who shoots it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=994.4s)]
*  Let's go to the next image. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=995.4s)]
*  There you go. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=998.16s)]
*  Then you see him shooting at her. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=998.8s)]
*  What's the justification for [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1000.4399999999999s)]
*  shooting at an Australian [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1001.7199999999999s)]
*  journalist who's literally doing [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1002.76s)]
*  nothing wrong? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1004.24s)]
*  She's doing her job. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1004.8s)]
*  She's reporting on the scene. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1005.56s)]
*  So when you see those types of acts, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1007.8399999999999s)]
*  that kind of brutality carried out [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1009.92s)]
*  by these officers and [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1011.92s)]
*  nothing ends up happening [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1013.16s)]
*  consequence wise, that's what [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1014.7199999999999s)]
*  leads to distrust and [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1016.68s)]
*  disdain toward local policing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1017.9599999999999s)]
*  And I would like justice to be [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1020.0s)]
*  brought. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1021.5999999999999s)]
*  I would like something to be done [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1022.16s)]
*  about these cops. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1024.0s)]
*  Because if you don't have trust in [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1025.6s)]
*  the police force, you don't have a [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1027.8s)]
*  well-functioning city or society. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1029.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's what we've been dealing [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1031.96s)]
*  with in LA for years now and [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  it's incredibly frustrating. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1035.24s)]
*  All right, finally, I want to talk [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1037.68s)]
*  a little bit about the police [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1039.52s)]
*  department. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1041.08s)]
*  They've been dealing with [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1042.24s)]
*  shortages and on top of that, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1043.6s)]
*  on top of the staffing shortages, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1045.24s)]
*  the city of LA just passed their [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1047.16s)]
*  latest budget which cuts the [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1048.8799999999999s)]

*  12 classes of 40. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1065.04s)]
*  So that's been the plan at a time [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1066.32s)]
*  when we're already dealing with [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1068.56s)]
*  staffing shortages. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1070.8400000000001s)]

*  Now let's move on to Gavin Newsom [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1081.44s)]
*  who made clear that he intends to [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1083.08s)]

*  the employment of the National [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1086.56s)]

*  exactly what Trump wanted. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1089.84s)]
*  That's correct, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1092.48s)]
*  this is what he wanted. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1093.04s)]
*  Congratulations, he flamed the [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1093.8s)]
*  fires and illegally acted to [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1095.44s)]
*  federalize the National Guard. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1096.84s)]
*  I don't know if that's actually [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1098.56s)]
*  true. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1100.4s)]
*  Now the order he signed doesn't [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1100.92s)]
*  just apply to California, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1102.96s)]
*  it will allow him to go into any [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1104.8s)]
*  state to do the same thing, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1106.84s)]
*  we're suing him. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1108.76s)]
*  I don't know what grounds Newsom [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1111.2s)]
*  has to sue him. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1113.56s)]
*  My understanding is that whether [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1115.28s)]

*  the President of the United States [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1117.68s)]

*  buildings and [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1127.2s)]
*  that's what they've been doing. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1128.04s)]
*  The real question is, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1129.68s)]
*  what recourse do Americans or [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1131.32s)]
*  local politicians have if any when [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1133.52s)]
*  it comes to sickening Marines [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1136.16s)]
*  against Americans? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1138.6s)]
*  That's what we really need to get [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1140.6s)]
*  some answers about. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1142.16s)]
*  But look, Newsom who's clearly [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1143.36s)]
*  already campaigning for [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1145.2s)]
*  the 2028 presidential campaign, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1146.48s)]
*  absolutely loves this. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1148.28s)]
*  I want to be clear about that. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1149.8s)]
*  He loves every moment of this. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1150.8s)]
*  It gives him an opportunity to [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1153.0800000000002s)]
*  essentially posture as some sort of [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1154.72s)]
*  savior who's willing to go head to [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1156.68s)]
*  head with Donald Trump. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1158.56s)]
*  It helps distract from his [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1159.92s)]
*  failures in California, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1161.68s)]
*  including the boondoggle high speed [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1163.3600000000001s)]
*  rail which he has failed in getting [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1165.8s)]
*  built, growing homelessness, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1168.0800000000002s)]
*  housing crisis. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1170.32s)]
*  I mean, California has been a mess [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1172.32s)]
*  of his leadership. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1173.96s)]
*  And then there was this cringe [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1175.16s)]
*  moment, take a look. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1176.3600000000001s)]
*  Come after me, arrest me, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1177.92s)]
*  let's just get it over with, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1179.28s)]
*  tough guy. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1180.68s)]
*  I don't give a damn, but [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1181.2s)]
*  I care about my community, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1182.8400000000001s)]
*  I care about this community. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1184.68s)]
*  The hell are they doing? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1187.48s)]
*  These guys need to grow up, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1189.0s)]
*  they need to stop, and [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1190.48s)]
*  we need to push back. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1191.68s)]
*  And I'm sorry to be so clear, but [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1193.08s)]
*  that kind of bloviating is [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1195.16s)]
*  exhausting. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1196.92s)]
*  So Tom, arrest me, let's go. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1197.92s)]
*  Yes, bloviating is definitely [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1201.0s)]
*  exhausting, Newsom. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1202.84s)]
*  And he thinks he's not guilty of [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1204.04s)]
*  it, he's one of the worst [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1205.68s)]
*  perpetrators. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1207.08s)]
*  And look, he's done very little to [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1208.12s)]
*  do anything to protect Angelino's [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1210.44s)]
*  or Californians. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1212.72s)]
*  Again, the quality of life has been [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1214.56s)]
*  diminished under his leadership. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1216.68s)]
*  So the idea that he's going to be [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1218.72s)]
*  a great leader for [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1220.72s)]
*  the country is laughable to me. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1221.92s)]
*  But I need you guys to also [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1224.32s)]
*  understand where the majority of [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1225.8799999999999s)]
*  Americans are when it comes to [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1227.96s)]
*  the issue of immigration. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1229.8s)]
*  Because poll after poll, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1231.24s)]
*  you have Americans telling everyone [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1232.84s)]
*  what they think about what's going [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1234.96s)]
*  on, and I think Democrats are not [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1236.96s)]
*  being strategic in response to it. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1238.96s)]
*  So here's what I mean, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1241.64s)]
*  let's take a look at Harry Enton. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1242.72s)]
*  And his first term Trump was way, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1245.24s)]
*  way, way underwater, minus 21 [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1247.0s)]
*  points. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1248.76s)]
*  But look at this, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1249.44s)]
*  he's up over 20 points, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1250.28s)]
*  now in the aggregate. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1251.6s)]
*  He is in positive territory at plus [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1253.2s)]
*  one point on his net approval [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1255.28s)]
*  rating. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1257.04s)]
*  Some other polls even have it a [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1257.68s)]
*  little bit higher than that. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1259.04s)]
*  There is no issue on which Trump [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1260.24s)]
*  is doing so much better than he [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1262.08s)]
*  was in his first term more than [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1263.88s)]
*  the issue of immigration. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1265.64s)]
*  No wonder the Times has written up [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1267.84s)]
*  the way that he is. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1269.52s)]
*  Trump is begging for [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1270.4s)]
*  a fight on this because he knows [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1271.36s)]
*  what he's doing so far is working [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1272.92s)]
*  with the American electorate. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1274.6s)]
*  The American electorate believed [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1276.48s)]
*  that the Democrats don't have [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1278.4s)]
*  a clue on the issue of immigration. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1279.96s)]
*  I mean, you could just take it here. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1281.88s)]
*  Closer to trust more in immigration, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1283.24s)]
*  Democrats versus Republicans got [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1285.0s)]
*  three different polls for [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1286.68s)]
*  you across the board. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1288.0s)]
*  All tell the same story, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1289.24s)]
*  Republicans lead on the issue of [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1290.8s)]
*  immigration. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1292.88s)]
*  Well, what about the tactic that [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1294.96s)]
*  is currently being deployed by [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1296.68s)]
*  the Trump administration where they [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1298.24s)]
*  go into specific towns and cities [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1300.1200000000001s)]
*  to do these deportation operations? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1301.8s)]
*  I'm sure the majority of Americans [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1304.04s)]
*  don't find that popular, right? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1305.76s)]
*  I don't know, let's find out. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1307.68s)]
*  Why are people approving of Trump [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFPi7xcPWaU&t=1309.0s)]
