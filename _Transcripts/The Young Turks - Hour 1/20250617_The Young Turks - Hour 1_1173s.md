"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) lent her support to a resolution authored by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) that would prohibit U.S. involvement in Israel‚Äôs attacks on Iran.
Israel launched a wave of airstrikes against Iran last week, killing top military officials and nuclear scientists. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed for years that Iran is on the verge of getting nuclear weapons. Iran responded with a series of missile strikes of its own. The U.S. assisted the Israelis in shooting down several of them."

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

# Republican RUSHES To Prevent U.S. War With Iran, DEMS SIGN ON
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw)
*  This vote isn't about supporting or opposing President Trump. I voted for President Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=0.0s)]
*  I plan to vote for President Trump again. This vote is about exercising our constitutional [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=5.44s)]
*  authority, but more importantly, our moral obligation to decide when and where our troops [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=11.76s)]
*  are gonna be asked to give their lives. And we certainly don't need another war. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=18.0s)]
*  And if we do go to war, it needs to be with the blessing and the support of the people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=22.32s)]
*  and a mission that our soldiers can accomplish. And we do that by following the vision of our [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  founding fathers. We debate it here on the floor of the House. That's what this resolution is about. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=31.52s)]
*  Five years ago, GOP Congressman Thomas Massey was one of three Republican representatives [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=40.0s)]
*  that supported a resolution to stop Trump from taking military action against Iran without [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=45.68s)]
*  congressional approval. Now that our special ally Israel has waged war with Iran, Massey is urging [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=50.96s)]
*  opposition to war again. Massey is one of the most outspoken Republicans in urging the president [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=58.64s)]
*  in Congress against further US military action abroad. And he is consistent about this to his [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=65.28s)]
*  credit. He posted this to X yesterday. This is not our war, but if it were, Congress must decide such [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=71.04s)]
*  matters according to our Constitution. I'm introducing a bipartisan War Powers Resolution [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=78.24s)]
*  tomorrow to prohibit our involvement. I invite all members of Congress to co-sponsor this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  resolution. Now, Cenk, before we get into the details and the reactions, what are your thoughts [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  on this? Thank God. So we should all be helping them. In fact, you know what? I'm gonna go to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  it later in this story. I'm gonna tell you how you can help them. So we'll talk more about it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=104.56s)]
*  with Dave Smith at 8 o'clock Eastern tonight too. But I wanna get you started on helping this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=108.64s)]
*  movement that has organically started in Congress. Bernie's a big part of it. And the co-sponsor for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=113.68s)]
*  Tom Massey is Ro Khanna. You see that? That's actual bipartisanship. A Republican with principles [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=120.0s)]
*  and a Democrat with principles who are both against war saying not on our watch. Now, of course, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=127.84s)]
*  the great majority of Congress is bought by AIPAC, but we have a plan for that. I'll tell [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=133.2s)]
*  you about that in a minute. Yes, Ro Khanna also very consistent on this, not just with Iran or [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=137.6s)]
*  Gaza, but also with Yemen. And he posted this, no war in Iran. It's time for every member to go on [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  record. Are you with the neocons who led us into Iraq or do you stand with the American people? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm proud to co-lead this bipartisan war powers resolution with Representative Massey. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=158.16s)]
*  That's privileged and must receive a vote. The text of the resolution states, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=163.92s)]
*  Congress hereby directs the president to terminate the use of armed or United States armed forces [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=169.12s)]
*  from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of Iran or any part of its government or military. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=175.28s)]
*  Unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=180.24s)]
*  of military force against Iran. It clarifies though, but the resolution should not be used [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=186.72s)]
*  to disrupt intelligence gathering or the sharing of intelligence between the United States [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=193.04s)]
*  and any coalition partner. If the president determines such sharing is appropriate and in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=197.92s)]
*  the national security interests of the United States, key Democratic representatives have already [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=203.2s)]
*  signaled their support to back the resolution, including AOC and Rashida Tlaib. AOC said, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=208.24s)]
*  signing on. You see that here, Rashida Tlaib. I look forward to supporting this war powers [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=214.0s)]
*  resolution. The American people aren't falling for it. Again, we were lied to about weapons of mass [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=219.12s)]
*  destruction in Iraq that killed millions and forever changed lives. It's unconstitutional [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=226.32s)]
*  for Trump to go to war without a vote in Congress. Representative Don Beyer has also stated he would [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=231.04s)]
*  sign on. As of right now though, no other Republicans have co-sponsored the resolution. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=237.84s)]
*  We will see if there is meaningful bipartisan support as it develops. But over in the Senate, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=244.16s)]
*  Senators Bernie Sanders and Tim Kaine have already introduced two different but similar resolutions. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=250.08s)]
*  Yesterday, Bernie released a statement introducing his legislation prohibiting the use of federal [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=255.84s)]
*  funds for any use of military force in or against Iran with the exception of self-defense. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=260.8s)]
*  He posted here, tonight I introduced legislation to stop Trump from leading us into an illegal [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=267.6s)]
*  war with Iran. Another war in the Middle East could cost countless lives, waste trillions more [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  dollars and lead to even more deaths, more conflict and more displacement. The following Senators are [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=277.68s)]
*  joining Bernie on the legislation. Peter Welsh, Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkley, Chris Van Hollen, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  Ed Markey, Tammy Baldwin and Tina Smith. Senator Tim Kaine, as we mentioned earlier, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=292.0s)]
*  filed a separate resolution but with the same premise of enacting a war powers resolution. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=299.12s)]
*  Kaine led the charge with an almost identical resolution back in 2020, which passed in both [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=304.64s)]
*  the House and the Senate, but was vetoed by Trump and failed a veto vote in the Senate. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=309.76s)]
*  In a statement regarding his most recent resolution, Senator Kaine stated, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=315.44s)]
*  it is not in our national security interest to get into war with Iran unless that war is absolutely [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=320.48s)]
*  necessary to defend the United States. I'm deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=332.48s)]
*  The American people have no interest in setting service members to fight another forever war in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=338.8s)]
*  the Middle East. This resolution will ensure that if we decide to place our nation's men [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=344.0s)]
*  and women in uniform in a harm's way, we will have a debate and vote on it in Congress. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=349.28s)]
*  Kaine stated earlier today that he didn't have any co-sponsors ready to announce, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=354.64s)]
*  but quote, I definitely have interest. According to a new economist and YouGov poll released [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=359.28s)]
*  earlier today, like Cenk mentioned in the last block, only 16% of Americans back US involvement. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  60% say the US should not be involved, 24% were unsure. And the numbers are pretty similar when [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=372.08s)]
*  you get into party affiliation. Just 15% of Democrats believe the US should get involved, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=378.96s)]
*  and 23% of Republicans agree. More than 60% of Democrats, however, and more than 50% of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=384.64s)]
*  Republicans believe the US should not be involved. Among Trump voters specifically, 19% believe the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=392.08s)]
*  US should get involved in the growing conflict, while 53% believe we should stay out of it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  Another 28% said they were unsure, but does Trump care? No. I have not reached out to Iran [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=405.2s)]
*  for peace talks in any way, shape or form. This is just more highly fabricated fake news. If they [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=414.08s)]
*  want to talk, they know how to reach me. They should have taken the deal that was on the table, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=420.0s)]
*  would have saved a lot of lives. Cenk, you know what would have saved a lot of lives? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=425.44s)]
*  Not ripping up the deal that was already in place simply because Obama did it. I'm going crazy here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so that's definitely true. And that deal was perfectly fine. We had stopped their [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=437.2s)]
*  uranium enrichment program entirely. Everybody was happy with that deal except Israel. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=444.4s)]
*  And Israel didn't like the deal because it was a good deal. And it prevented war, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  and they've been wanting war since 1995. We already showed you the clip of Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=456.0s)]
*  since 95 to now saying, it's imminent. Iran's gotta get a nuke any day now, any week now, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=460.88s)]
*  right? So they've been lying about this from day one. That's why they were furious with Obama that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=466.32s)]
*  he made a really good peace deal with Iran that prevented them from having nukes. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=470.32s)]
*  And he's like, what are you doing? You're gonna take away my excuse to drag you guys into this war [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=474.8s)]
*  to knock out one of my regional rivals so I can dominate the Middle East and take more [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=480.4s)]
*  Palestinian land. And if you think that's conspiratorial, well, it's a conspiracy that's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=484.56s)]
*  out in the open now because the Israeli cabinet voted to take Gaza for Israel. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=489.68s)]
*  But there's nobody to fight back. There's no Hamas is gone, Hezbollah is gone, etc. You can say those [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=496.32s)]
*  are terrible organizations, but Israel wanted all of them wiped off the face of the earth. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=500.64s)]
*  And now wants Iran wiped off the face of the earth. They wanted Iraq wiped off the face of the earth. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=506.48s)]
*  Why? So they could completely dominate and no one can complain when they take Gaza, West Bank, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=511.44s)]
*  Western Syria, Southern Lebanon and set up greater Israel. And they have maps of greater Israel [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=517.6s)]
*  in their cabinet. So it's not like they're hiding it. They talk about Judea, Samaria, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=523.52s)]
*  etc. And how it's theirs. So this is an aggressive imperial empire, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=528.24s)]
*  but they don't wanna pay their own bills. They wanna make us pay their bills. We've already given [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=534.08s)]
*  them $311 billion in adjusted inflation, inflation adjusted numbers. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=539.12s)]
*  So are we ever gonna get the 311 billion back? No, they're just gonna keep it, right? Special [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=543.6s)]
*  ally only takes. They dragged us into the Iraq war with fake intelligence about WMD. What are [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=548.32s)]
*  they claiming about Iran? Fake intelligence about WMD. And so how much did that cost us in the [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=553.84s)]
*  global war on terror that we didn't need at all? All of these are all the people that have attacked [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=559.68s)]
*  us, etc. From the Muslim world, they're all Israel's enemies. Israel just dragged them over [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=564.72s)]
*  here to America and said, congratulations, they're now your enemies, you deal with it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=569.76s)]
*  Global war on terrorists cost America $8 trillion. Are we gonna get that money back from Israel? No. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=574.24s)]
*  And if you ask for money back, they'll say, anti-Semite, shut up and give me your money, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=582.08s)]
*  okay? It's almost like a goddamn robbery. Now to be fair to Israel, I guess if any government [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=589.44s)]
*  can just bribe our politicians, they could all do this. And by the way, others have begun to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=595.0400000000001s)]
*  figure it out. So Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia now funneling money to Trump, to our politicians, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=600.08s)]
*  to our think tanks. Cuz they're like, Israel just figured it out first. It's an open auction. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  They allow unlimited money in politics. These idiots will let anyone bribe their politicians. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=610.72s)]
*  The Supreme Court did that. We need an amendment to go above their heads, check out Wolfpack. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=616.88s)]
*  Okay, back to how we're gonna stop the war today. So originally I had a plan where I was gonna [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  go on with a right winger and ask for him to pick their champion. And I was gonna pick our [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=628.4000000000001s)]
*  champion, not because I'm the guy who has the credibility to pick it, etc. Forget about me, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm totally irrelevant. But everybody agrees to who our champion is, it's Bernie Sanders, right? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  But and I'm positive that whoever it was on the right would have picked Tom Massey. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=644.16s)]
*  And it turns out they're already champions. They don't need us to nominate them. They already did [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=648.64s)]
*  it without anybody asking them, introducing bills to stop this war in the House and in the Senate. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay, so step one's already done. Look, by the way, getting anyone to be opposed to war [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=659.52s)]
*  in Congress is a very hard ask. Like when Bernie used to do it, like decades ago, he was like, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=665.52s)]
*  sometimes the only person in Congress, Barbara Leah on Afghanistan was literally the only vote, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=672.16s)]
*  right? So all right, so step two is, well, now we all take a pledge. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  Because this is very important before I get to step two. They have to get you to do a vote on [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=684.4s)]
*  this. War powers resolution cannot be blocked by the president because it checks the president's [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=690.4s)]
*  power. Congress has the power to declare war according to the Constitution, so the president [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=695.36s)]
*  cannot object, okay? And since this is what is called a privileged bill, it must get a vote, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=700.8s)]
*  and it will get a vote within about 15 days. So they have to wait for 15 days in committee [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=708.24s)]
*  and then vote on this right around 4th of July. That is very powerful symbolism. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=713.8399999999999s)]
*  And they're all gonna have to go on the record, okay? So step two is, we all take a pledge [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=718.88s)]
*  to never, ever vote for anyone who votes for this war. Okay, if they vote no on the war, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=725.52s)]
*  then use your own judgment. Hey, you like their policies on Medicare and taxes and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=733.68s)]
*  all the other immigration, etc., all the other factors. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  But if they vote yes on this war, that's it. That's the last vote they ever take, okay? Now, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  are we going to be able to muster up enough people to do that? I don't know, but I'm gonna [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  go around the country and try to find out, okay? So who appointed me? No one other than you guys, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=750.72s)]
*  Young Turks members. You always send me on these missions, right? And so that mission starts tonight [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=756.1600000000001s)]
*  at 8 o'clock with Dave Smith. I would argue the head of the Libertarians in this country at this [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=761.9200000000001s)]
*  point. And I'm gonna ask him if he's willing to go along with this pledge. The pledge is right now on [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=766.1600000000001s)]
*  unitedagainstwar.com, okay? So check that out, unitedagainstwar.com. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=771.76s)]
*  And it's super simple. I pledge to vote against any legislator that supports US involvement in [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=777.68s)]
*  the war with Iran, period. They all have to vote on it, they don't have a choice. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=783.76s)]
*  And we're all gonna see it. And step three is we're gonna track it. And look, I don't know how many [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=788.56s)]
*  of us will see what the pledge, how many of us are gonna vote based on that. But if it gets to a [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=795.28s)]
*  million, I bet they get uncomfortable. If it gets to 2 million, 5 million, they start to get super [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=800.8s)]
*  uncomfortable, cuz those votes, Republican or Democrat, are gonna be locked in, set in stone. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=805.92s)]
*  You vote to get America into war, that's the last goddamn vote you're gonna take. That's our pledge [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=814.0799999999999s)]
*  as American citizens. Remember, only 16% want this war. The rest of us don't want it. So if the rest [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=819.92s)]
*  of us rise up, if these establishment figures, the Uniparty, Neocons, whatever you wanna call them, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=826.0s)]
*  if they have awoken a sleeping giant, we're gonna find out. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=832.56s)]
*  Now look, if Young Turks does this by themselves, sometimes we've moved [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=837.28s)]
*  progressives in Congress. Other times we've helped to create the Justice Democrats, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=842.7199999999999s)]
*  and that made a difference, etc. But we cannot do it on our own. So we've gotta bring in the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=847.3599999999999s)]
*  libertarians for sure they're definitely anti-war. And we've gotta bring in true America First, that [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=852.4s)]
*  actually believed in America First more than they believed in Trump. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=859.12s)]
*  If you say no, Trump's my daddy, and if he says war, then I love war. And if he says [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=863.12s)]
*  Israel First, America Second, then I'm for America Second. Then you're not gonna sign it, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=868.64s)]
*  and you're not gonna be interested, and you're not anti-war, you're not part of our group. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=872.8s)]
*  That's okay, go off into the corner. Some in the radical left will say, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=876.24s)]
*  I'm never gonna work with the Republicans, never. It would taint my morality and my purity. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=880.16s)]
*  All right, go away, go away, go sit on your couch, do whatever you're gonna do, okay? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=884.88s)]
*  But for the rest of us, for the 84%, for God's sake, let's do something. So we're gonna track [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=888.96s)]
*  those guys, and if they vote yes for the war, let's all pledge to make sure that they never win. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  And one thing that's important, guys, this is not partisan. You defeat them in their primaries. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=902.88s)]
*  So you don't have to worry, my God, is this a trick to get me to vote for Republicans? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=908.4000000000001s)]
*  Is this a trick to get me to vote for Democrats? No, you eliminate them in the primary, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=912.8000000000001s)]
*  okay? So that way you're gonna have a Republican if you're a Republican, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=918.48s)]
*  you're gonna have a Democrat if you're a Democrat. But you're just not gonna have that incumbent [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=921.28s)]
*  who is not for this country, who's for a different country, okay? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=925.04s)]
*  We're gonna get American representatives back into Congress. That's the plan. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=928.96s)]
*  If it doesn't work, I'm fine with it, okay? If it turns out, there's, ha ha, look at that, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=933.44s)]
*  Cenk and Young Turks and Young Turks members and all this. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=937.9200000000001s)]
*  Now, good earnest people wanted to stop war who were honest, ha ha, they tried but they failed. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=940.96s)]
*  Okay, I can live with it as long as we try. Jordan? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=946.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's worth trying. I really appreciate Thomas Massey for remaining consistent and just [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=949.44s)]
*  being consistent on war powers resolutions, US involvement abroad, intervention and regime change. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=958.24s)]
*  Seldom you see people who are consistent on that. I think he really is the most consistent [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=966.72s)]
*  out of everyone on the broader right. We'll throw Libertarians in there to some extent. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=975.7600000000001s)]
*  But yeah, on Gaza, on this, on Iran, both as we showed you in 2020 and now, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=980.08s)]
*  really appreciate that from him. So credit words do. Good on him and he was out early on this. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=988.72s)]
*  It's not someone waiting until it's convenient to do something. So I really, really appreciate that. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=994.6400000000001s)]
*  Good to see others jumping on. Love to see more Democrats sign on. Of course, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1000.0s)]
*  we welcome Republicans in Congress signing on. I don't know how many we'll get. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1005.76s)]
*  But yeah, I think hanging this around their necks is good, not just for preventing, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1011.12s)]
*  hopefully preventing war now, but also down the line when some of these inevitably seek, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1015.28s)]
*  potentially the presidency or if they're in the House, a Senate race. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1021.2s)]
*  Hang this around their necks in those campaigns as well. Make them wear this for the rest of [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1025.68s)]
*  their political career. You saw how that hurt Hillary in 2016. People didn't want to support [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1030.8s)]
*  her in large part because of her support for the war in Iraq. So the more we can do this and the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1037.28s)]
*  more we can brand these career politicians who are in there to represent the military industrial [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1044.24s)]
*  complex and almost nothing else, maybe some corporate interests to diversify. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1049.28s)]
*  But make that their political brand for the rest of their careers. I would support any and all [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1054.0s)]
*  efforts to try to do that. Yes, and look guys, the most important part of the plan is you have to [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1059.52s)]
*  vote against them. If they get away with this, they're basically saying, it's not a democracy [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1066.08s)]
*  anymore. It's not your country. Whichever government comes in here and whichever corporation [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1072.72s)]
*  comes in here and bribes us. And we're told all of us are open for bribes. They are. They [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1077.12s)]
*  literally take billions of dollars in bribes, which mainstream media calls campaign contributions, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1081.9199999999998s)]
*  because it largely goes to them when they spend ads in mainstream media, right? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  When they buy those ads, the media is the beneficiary of all that corruption. So that's [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1090.08s)]
*  why mainstream media never tells you about it, right? But any corporation in any government can [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1095.6s)]
*  buy these guys. So if these guys go, no, I don't serve America. I serve my donors and my donors [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1099.84s)]
*  at APAC, which APAC has given to almost everyone in the house but 30 members. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1107.04s)]
*  So they control. And if you're in mainstream media and you say no, no, giving a couple of million [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1113.6s)]
*  dollars to a congressman doesn't mean you control them. You're funny, you're hilarious. But you [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1119.04s)]
*  don't even realize that you're a joke, that the rest of the country now is not listening to you [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1124.3999999999999s)]
*  anymore. We think that your guys are disgusting propagandists, telling us no, politicians are so [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1129.76s)]
*  honorable, they'd never be affected by millions of dollars. What kind of a fool says that, let alone [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1136.48s)]
*  a so-called reporter? So we're not listening to any of that garbage anymore. So if they vote yes [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1142.72s)]
*  for this, there has to be accountability. You're the accountability. That's why I'm calling this [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1148.32s)]
*  operation consequences. You take that war vote to drag America into yet another [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1155.2s)]
*  census war in the Middle East, and there's going to be political consequences. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxarOap5qw&t=1161.52s)]
