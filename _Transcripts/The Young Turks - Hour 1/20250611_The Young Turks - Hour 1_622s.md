# "Regretful" Elon Musk Grovels To Trump
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g)
*  You were very kind to him. I saw you together and I think he treated you a bit like a father. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=0.0s)]
*  And- I was disappointed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=4.8s)]
*  Yeah. In him. But it is what it is that happens. Things like that happen. I don't blame him for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=6.8s)]
*  anything that I was a little disappointed. Could you reconcile? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=14.64s)]
*  Very low energy President Donald Trump is weighing in yet again on his [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=21.92s)]
*  lovers quarrel with Elon Musk. So is DC's former power couple getting back together? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=27.68s)]
*  Well, there are some pretty big updates here because Elon Musk is apparently looking to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  make up with Trump. And Trump seems to be a little more receptive this time around. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=39.28s)]
*  So before we get to Trump and how he's weighing in on all of this, let's get to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=49.92s)]
*  I regret some of my posts about President Donald Trump last week. They went too far. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=51.92s)]
*  Now was he didn't really tell us which comments he felt went too far. I can think of one that was [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=61.6s)]
*  particularly, I don't know, explosive. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=70.88s)]
*  It's just funny. It's just funny. But it also just speaks to the idea that people are like, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=77.12s)]
*  oh, Trump is going to be in trouble without- It's like, no, man, this guy's in charge of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=85.92s)]
*  the federal government. He can do all kinds of things to Elon and his businesses at the snap [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=90.8s)]
*  of a finger. In fact, I think that's a big reason why a lot of these tech people got in line [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=96.96s)]
*  in the first place is that, all over the Democrats and backstabbing them will not [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  result in retaliations. Whereas if you piss off Trump, you know he's going to retaliate against [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=110.72s)]
*  you. That's how we got some of the antitrust cases against these tech companies in the first place [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=117.36s)]
*  is that Trump felt like they were overly helpful of Democrats. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=123.76s)]
*  And so yeah, they made the correct calculation that you shouldn't cross Trump [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  because they'll actually get back at you and treat you like an enemy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=133.68s)]
*  And I think Elon is slowly realizing like, yeah, let me not do that. Because these guys [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=137.84s)]
*  can really make my life harder than I need it to be. I mean, on the day of this relationship, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=142.96s)]
*  basically blowing up on that Friday, Tesla stock just cratered. It just really, really went down. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=149.2s)]
*  And so I wouldn't be surprised if Elon Musk has his business interests front and center. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't think that he's changed his mind on how he feels about the so-called big, beautiful bill. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=164.32s)]
*  But who knows, maybe he'll feel better about it now that Senate Republicans are thinking about [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  getting rid of the provisions that would have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=174.4s)]
*  The tax savings that would benefit working class Americans, that's on the chopping block. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=180.0s)]
*  So maybe the debt that this bill would contribute to wouldn't be as extreme. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  So maybe he'll change his mind. I don't know, I doubt it though. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=192.72s)]
*  But just to remind you all of what he accused Donald Trump of, he said without me, Trump would [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=196.32s)]
*  have lost the election. Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=200.56s)]
*  In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=210.16s)]
*  SpaceX will be decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=215.28s)]
*  And then finally, we highlighted this because this is probably [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=219.68s)]
*  what he's thinking about when he says maybe I went too far. It's where he basically accused, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=222.8s)]
*  indirectly accused Donald Trump of being a pedophile by being in the Epstein files. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=228.0s)]
*  So look, if he is talking about that particular post, which he has since deleted, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=232.56s)]
*  it kind of shows how deeply pathetic he is. So on Friday, he wrote the following on X. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=239.12s)]
*  I will apologize profusely as soon as there is a full dump of the Epstein files. They call them [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=244.96s)]
*  dumps, big dumps, okay? There isn't gonna be a dump of the Epstein files. And so he deleted [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=252.24s)]
*  that later. He deleted the original Epstein Trump tweet or post. And then he's gonna be a good boy, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=257.76s)]
*  gonna be a good boy and do what Trump wants him to do. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  He's gonna shut his mouth about the big beautiful bill because he doesn't want his businesses to be [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=269.28s)]
*  harmed by decisions that Trump makes in retaliation to what Musk has said about him. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=273.12s)]
*  Yeah, and we know for a fact that his issues weren't the big beautiful bill. He started [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=279.12s)]
*  going against the bill because certain stuff like the NASA guy that he wanted to install, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  the little puppet he wanted to install that NASA got rejected. And he was having problems [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=294.0s)]
*  with the entire cabinet because Elon Musk is deeply weird and antisocial and nobody [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=299.68s)]
*  ever likes the guy. And so yeah, he was just doing something to retaliate. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=305.28s)]
*  This wasn't like, this guy's such a huge believer in not giving the rich a bunch of mega ridiculous [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=311.12s)]
*  tax cuts. It was just his own personal grievances. And so I did it, he's not gonna [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=320.0s)]
*  dist the big beautiful bill anymore. He never gave a damn in the first place. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=325.84s)]
*  Yeah, I do think it was more about his government grants and contracts and his preferred people [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=330.0s)]
*  getting top spots in government agencies, definitely. Now, let's get to Donald Trump [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=337.12s)]
*  because I am curious, is Trump open to making up with him? So as we discussed earlier this week, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=342.56s)]
*  Musk had an interesting reaction to a clip of JD Vance saying that [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=349.52s)]
*  Musk could get back into Trump's good graces. Here's the clip of Vance saying that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=353.84s)]
*  Hopefully, Elon figures it out, comes back into the fold. I know the president for a couple days, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=360.32s)]
*  I'll tell you, I don't want to reveal too many confidences, but he was getting a little [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=367.52s)]
*  frustrated feeling like some of the criticisms were unfair coming from Elon. But I think it's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=371.2s)]
*  been very restrained because the president doesn't think that he needs to be in a blood [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=376.24s)]
*  feud with Elon Musk. And I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=381.68s)]
*  Okay. So to that statement from JD Vance, Musk wrote simply, cool. Okay, so now what? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=386.96s)]
*  Well, during an appearance on Pod Force One. Sorry. Pod saved America, Pod doesn't need to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  be in the title of your podcast. But anyway, it's okay, whatever. During a conversation on that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=413.84s)]
*  new podcast, he opened up about his fractured relationship with Musk. Let's take a look at that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=418.0s)]
*  Is there anything that you can do to forgive him? Could you see that happening? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=424.64s)]
*  Well, look, I have no hard feelings. I was really surprised that that happened. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=430.96s)]
*  He went after a bill that's phenomenal. It's the best thing we've ever signed in this country. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=438.16s)]
*  And that's phase one, phase two, phase three. All of a sudden, it all comes together. It's [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=444.32000000000005s)]
*  coming together so well. And when he did that, I was not a happy camper. So it's too bad. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=449.12s)]
*  You said he had problems. What kind of problems? I mean, is it the drugs? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=455.36s)]
*  I don't know what his problem is really. I don't know. I haven't thought too much about [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=458.56s)]
*  him in the last little while. But the bill is so good. When he went after the bill, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=462.16s)]
*  bill is gonna turn around this country so fast your head will spin. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=468.24s)]
*  I think a bill is great. And I think he feels very badly that he said that actually. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=471.6s)]
*  And maybe it was something else. I mean, he had the fight with Scott Bisson outside your office. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=476.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, they had not a fist fight, people. But I guess they had a little bit of a shouting match. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=482.0s)]
*  Sick puppy, sick puppy. He likes to say that a lot too. Okay, so let's finally get to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  his final decision. His feelings about Elon Musk now that he's kind of semi-apologized. Let's watch. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=494.0s)]
*  It is what it is that happens. Things like that happen. I don't blame him for anything. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=500.4s)]
*  I was a little disappointed. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=507.76s)]
*  Could you reconcile? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=509.04s)]
*  Say it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=511.04s)]
*  Could you reconcile with him? Do you think? Could you forgive him? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=511.28s)]
*  I guess I could. But we have to straighten out the country. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=513.68s)]
*  Do we have to straighten out the country? You're causing total chaos in the country [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=518.32s)]
*  as we speak. How hilarious is that? Look, whatever. I'm sure that they'll bury the hatchet, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=522.4s)]
*  which sucks because their feud was super entertaining. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=529.12s)]
*  And it kind of gave me something fun to focus on amid all of the terrible stories that we have [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=532.4s)]
*  to cover on a daily basis. But nonetheless, it looks like they're on a path to recovery, Waz. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=537.28s)]
*  I'm sure they're great friends. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump is actually smart enough to be like, look, I don't need to carry a blood feud with this dude [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  forever. He might one day be useful again. It's just that he's on the outs because his usefulness [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=549.6s)]
*  has expired. The expiration date is over. That's why they pushed him to the side. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l20bNbzjv1g&t=556.4s)]
