# Elon Musk Vs. Donald Trump WAR Breaks Out, Epstein Accusations FLY
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag)
*  Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we'll well anymore. I was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=0.0s)]
*  surprised because you were here. Everybody in this room practically was here as we had [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=6.28s)]
*  a wonderful send off. He said wonderful things about me. You couldn't have nicer said the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=10.88s)]
*  best things. He's worn that hat. Trump was right about everything. And I am right about [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=15.08s)]
*  the great big beautiful bill. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=21.12s)]
*  I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=23.439999999999998s)]
*  Oh damn, civil wars begun within mag and Donald Trump versus Elon Musk. Here's what we're [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=28.4s)]
*  going to do guys. We're going to cover blow by blow. We're going to show you every step [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=34.6s)]
*  of the way. What did Elon say? What did Trump say? What did Elon say? And we're going to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=38.0s)]
*  pause and tell you who's right and wrong. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=41.36s)]
*  Because on some of these comments, some of them, both of them are very right and very [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=43.4s)]
*  wrong. So it is really interesting. This is the mother of all battles within MAGA. Who's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=49.12s)]
*  going to win? I have no idea. Okay, I know who's right and wrong on the different issues. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=55.08s)]
*  I don't know who's going to win. And I'm overall at the end of all of it, who is more correct? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  That is what we're asking on tyt.com. Donald Trump or Elon Musk. And on that one, I'm not [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=64.36s)]
*  positive yet either. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=70.8s)]
*  Let's go through the whole list and then decide at the end. So Sharon is of course going [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=72.24s)]
*  to help me do this. Sharon, what's up first? How did this get triggered? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=75.8s)]
*  Well, we'll start from the beginning. Cenk, Trump made it official today. Public and couple. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=80.32s)]
*  That was Elon Musk, President Donald Trump. So in love at one point, they are no more. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  They're done. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=92.84s)]
*  Right now, they're both taking turns trashing each other publicly on social media platforms. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=93.84s)]
*  The ones that they each own, of course. And by the way, the Epstein files are involved [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=99.56s)]
*  in this. So we'll go there, Cenk. Before we get into more details, because it does [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=104.76s)]
*  get even spicier. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, great hype manual, Cenk. Did you expect, I guess the first question, and then we'll [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  get into right and wrong. The breakup to end. Did you expect it to be so quick, this demise [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  of a relationship? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=124.72s)]
*  Yeah. So I thought that given how strong both of their personalities are and how they both [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=126.04s)]
*  want to be alpha dogs. That collision, I wouldn't say was imminent, but very likely, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  Did I think it would happen this quickly? No, no. It's a little bit stunning what has [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=140.48s)]
*  happened. The fact that it has devolved to the point where Musk is throwing out charges [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=146.16s)]
*  about Trump being on Epstein files. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=150.48s)]
*  Whoa, okay. I mean, this got real. So, okay, but it started with the budget, and Elon was [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=154.48s)]
*  mad about it for some reason. So let's explain that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so sitting alongside the Chancellor of Germany earlier today, President Donald [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=166.83999999999997s)]
*  Trump was asked about Elon's recent criticisms of the big, beautiful bill. And so that's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=171.2s)]
*  what you're hearing in that first clip. As a refresher though, during a recent CBS interview, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=177.0s)]
*  Musk expressed his disappointment with the bill, following it up a few days later with [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=181.36s)]
*  this post on X. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=189.8s)]
*  spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it. You know [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  you did wrong. He goes on to say, you know it. Now, of course, the President, Donald [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=202.12s)]
*  Trump, obviously doesn't take criticism well, made his dissatisfaction with the Tesla CEO [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=209.0s)]
*  clear during the press engagement, accusing him of self-interest, being butt hurt. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=213.84s)]
*  This is what this thing devolved into. What he didn't get his way, listen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=220.32s)]
*  I've always liked Elon, and I was always very surprised. You saw the words he had for me, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  the words. And yes, instead of thinking about me that's bad, I'd rather have him criticize [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=230.44s)]
*  me than the bill, because the bill is incredible. We are doing things in that bill that are [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=235.11999999999998s)]
*  unbelievable. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  And when you look at what we're doing for small businesses, for people, for middle-income [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  people, all of the things that we're doing, nobody's ever seen anything like it. And you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=246.92s)]
*  know, Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=253.04s)]
*  vehicles. And you know, they're having a hard time with the electric vehicles, and they [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=258.96s)]
*  want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=263.58000000000004s)]
*  And you know, Elon knew this from the beginning. He knew it for a long time ago. That's been [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=268.38s)]
*  I would say JD, that hasn't changed. That's been right from the beginning, Mr. Secretary. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=274.74s)]
*  That hasn't changed at all, right from the beginning. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=280.86s)]
*  All right, Cenk, so Elon was quick to dispute that. We'll get to that, but do you want to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=283.22s)]
*  weigh in now about the president? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely, so I'm gonna score one for each side here. So when Elon Musk says this bill's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=291.62s)]
*  an abomination and it's gonna add trillions to the deficit, that is correct. The Congressional [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=297.14s)]
*  Budget Office says that it will add at least $2.4 trillion to the deficit. Why? Even though [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=302.65999999999997s)]
*  it has $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and to SNAP, which hurts of course, low-income [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=308.94s)]
*  Americans. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  It has $3.6 trillion in tax cuts, the majority of which go to the very, very wealthy. So [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=317.1s)]
*  since they wanna give this giant gift of $3.6 trillion in tax cuts, and yes, it's true that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  there is also for the moment being, and we're gonna come back to this a little bit later, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  tax cuts for tips and overtime as well, okay? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=336.1s)]
*  But overall, the tax cuts make this so significant that yes, it's gonna blow a huge hole in the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=340.42s)]
*  deficit and the debt. So score one for Elon on that, that is correct, okay? Whether he [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=347.94s)]
*  wants the tax cuts is a different question. What he actually wants is a different question, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=353.14000000000004s)]
*  but technically on those facts, he's definitely correct. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=357.62s)]
*  Okay, now Trump says, well, look, he wanted the electric vehicle mandate and we took it [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=360.06s)]
*  out of there. Do I believe that Elon wanted the electric vehicle mandate? Yes, I definitely [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=364.58000000000004s)]
*  believe that. That obviously affects his company, and later he complained about others [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=369.78s)]
*  getting subsidies, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=373.94s)]
*  Why are we not getting subsidies for electric vehicles if oil and gas are getting? We'll [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=376.26s)]
*  get to that, right? But is Trump right that Elon probably was upset about that? Yes, is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  it right to give subsidies to those electric vehicles? Look, the right and the left are [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  both mixed on that. The left wanted the subsidies in the first place, but now it's going to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=392.61999999999995s)]
*  Tesla, so they caught feelings over that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=397.02s)]
*  To me, the correct answer is take out almost all the subsidies that go to giant corporations. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=399.5s)]
*  Why is the average American taxpayer funding the most successful, largest, richest companies [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=406.02s)]
*  in the world? They don't need our money, so I would score that one for Donald Trump. So [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=412.85999999999996s)]
*  so far, we got a one-one tie. All right, what's next, Sharon? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=417.65999999999997s)]
*  All right, so they're tied up. Just want to get Elon's response to some of what Donald [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  Trump said there. False, this bill was never shown to me once. It was passed in the dead [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=427.02000000000004s)]
*  of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it. We know that's kind of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=431.46000000000004s)]
*  true because Marjorie Taylor Greene has admitted that she did not read the bill, at least most [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=437.22s)]
*  of it. Trump continued though, also claiming Elon Musk was but heard about Trump vetoing [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=441.58000000000004s)]
*  his pick for NASA head. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=446.74s)]
*  He wanted and rightfully, he recommended somebody that he, I guess, knew very well. I'm sure [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=450.3s)]
*  he respected him, but to run NASA. And I didn't think it was appropriate. And he happened [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=457.38s)]
*  to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat. And I say, look, we won. We get certain privileges [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=463.42s)]
*  and one of the privileges, we don't have to appoint a Democrat. NASA is very important. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=470.4s)]
*  We have great people. General Kane is gonna be picking somebody with our, we'll be checking [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=475.02s)]
*  them out, saying, but he wanted that person, a certain person, and we said no. And I can [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=482.78s)]
*  understand why he's upset. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=489.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm doing some more explaining there, Cenk. So, Elon was dismissive of that too. He then [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=490.82s)]
*  posted a series of old comments from the president, but first, way in there about NASA head. Is [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=500.74s)]
*  that what this is about? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=506.14s)]
*  Yeah, so here again, we got a split decision. So, Elon is right that the bill came out and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=507.26s)]
*  then they said vote on it right away afterwards. Marjorie Taylor Greene kind of hilariously [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=513.18s)]
*  said, well, oops, I didn't get a chance to read it. And there was a provision I really [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=518.06s)]
*  didn't like in there. I gave her credit yesterday on the show for at least being honest about [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=521.14s)]
*  it, but she should have read the bill. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=525.14s)]
*  So anyways, overall, did Elon know that they were gonna cut his subsidies? He probably [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=527.26s)]
*  knew, even if he didn't read the bill. That one is already a split decision, but I'll [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=531.86s)]
*  give it to Elon because it's true that the bill came out so late that almost nobody could [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=535.5s)]
*  read it in time. The lobbyists make these decisions for the politicians anyway. On the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=540.14s)]
*  other hand, is it true that Trump would not give Elon the person he wanted as the head [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=545.06s)]
*  of NASA? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=549.98s)]
*  Yes, that's true. And was Elon probably upset about it? Almost certainly. And he wants NASA [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=550.98s)]
*  to do more deals with SpaceX. That's gonna be a little bit relevant later in some of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=557.38s)]
*  the exchanges. And since Trump is not doing a favor to a donor, whether it's the subsidies [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=562.14s)]
*  or giving him the NASA head, that one's a little, I'm gonna technically score it on [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=571.14s)]
*  the card here as one for each, but that one weighs heavily more in favor of Trump. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=576.6600000000001s)]
*  By the way, if you're on the right and you think, okay, good, he's saying Trump is right [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=581.58s)]
*  or Elon is right, depending on the issue. If you're on the left and you're saying, oh, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=586.66s)]
*  I don't like you saying that either one of them is right. Well, one of them has to be [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=590.74s)]
*  right. So if it makes you feel better, you could just think, oh, Elon is wrong on that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=594.0600000000001s)]
*  one and Trump is wrong on the other one. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=598.34s)]
*  But either way, it comes out to the same conclusion. All right, let's go to the next round. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=600.98s)]
*  Nice, so they're still tied up. Now to the old material, the historical context, we'll [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=605.02s)]
*  call it that Elon was giving on X. Put it up. I couldn't agree more as he pulls up old [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=610.18s)]
*  statements from Donald Trump. Talking about no member of Congress should be eligible for [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=615.66s)]
*  reelection if our country's budget is not balanced. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=618.98s)]
*  So that's gotta sting in light of the big beautiful bill. Remember this one? Real Donald [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=621.98s)]
*  Trump breaking Trump just went to bat for Elon Musk outside the White House while examining [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=627.5s)]
*  the Teslas. So Elon taking a trip down memory lane, but he was pissed, make no mistake about [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=633.14s)]
*  Whatever. Keep the EV solar incentive cuts in the bill even though no oil and gas subsidies [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=642.18s)]
*  are touched, very unfair. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=648.06s)]
*  But ditch the mountain of disgusting pork in the bill. In the entire history of civilization, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=649.9399999999999s)]
*  there was never, there's never been legislation that both big and beautiful. Everyone knows [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=657.02s)]
*  this. Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=663.38s)]
*  is the way. They're talking about bills, politics, policy, not something else. But go ahead, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=669.8399999999999s)]
*  weigh in on that, Cenk. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=678.8399999999999s)]
*  Elon, furious. And so this goes on and on. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=680.68s)]
*  This one's a relatively clean win for Elon. So first he mentions, hey, you said that if [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=684.16s)]
*  you can't balance the budget, you shouldn't be reelected, shouldn't be president. Well, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=689.64s)]
*  Trump did say that and Trump has never balanced the budget. He had a whole first term and [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=694.16s)]
*  he put over $8 trillion on the deficit, on the debt. And it's more than any other president [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=698.96s)]
*  in American history and he only did that in four years. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=705.68s)]
*  Now this would add, as we told you earlier, $2.4 trillion to the debt. Now I don't know [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=709.48s)]
*  that Elon wants the real answer. The real answer is stop giving away all the money to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=714.16s)]
*  the rich. Here, I'll give you one quick fact about that. People making over $500,000 a [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=720.36s)]
*  year are going to get a $1.7 trillion tax cut. Just those guys. Do they really need [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=725.28s)]
*  an extra $1.7 trillion? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=733.64s)]
*  Okay, that's what's causing the problem with the debt. I don't know if Elon's willing to [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=735.76s)]
*  acknowledge that, but on the facts, he is right. This doesn't come anywhere near balancing [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=739.8s)]
*  the budget and it never will. This bill has a 0% chance of being balanced. No chance at [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=745.84s)]
*  all. Write it down in stone, I absolutely guarantee it, okay? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=751.84s)]
*  But the bigger win for Elon here is when he's pointing out oil and gas subsidies. And this [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=757.8000000000001s)]
*  is why I love this fight, Sharon, because they're accidentally or on purpose just because [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=763.6s)]
*  they're fighting, exposing all the dirty laundry of both sides. I mean, this much tea hasn't [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=768.84s)]
*  been spilled since the Boston Tea Party, okay? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=776.84s)]
*  And so here, Elon is pointing out oil and gas subsidies. You guys know that that's about [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=781.48s)]
*  30 billion a year? We've been giving subsidies to the oil companies for nearly 100 years [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=787.52s)]
*  straight. They're among the most profitable companies not only now, but in the history [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=793.2800000000001s)]
*  of the world. And John and Jane Doe have to take out money from their paychecks and send [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=797.64s)]
*  it to Exxon Mobil. For what? And they're not a new industry. They don't need a leg up to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=803.52s)]
*  be able to compete. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=809.4200000000001s)]
*  No, we give them all of these subsidies for no reason. It's a giant robbery. So on this [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=810.9200000000001s)]
*  one, clear win for Elon, so he goes up three-two. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=817.52s)]
*  All right, so three-two corporate welfare. Wow. Things got even nastier, though, Jane. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=820.52s)]
*  They did. During the same press gaggle, Trump decided to downplay Musk's role in his election [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=828.4s)]
*  win. Listen. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=833.8s)]
*  We've done a great job. Elon knew that. Elon endorsed me very strongly. He actually went [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=836.1999999999999s)]
*  up in campaign for me. I think I would have won, Susie would say I would have won Pennsylvania [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=841.48s)]
*  easily anyway, even if the governor ran, the real governor, not the governor from Minnesota, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=846.3199999999999s)]
*  who's a, I mean, he's a sick puppy. That poor guy feels sorry for him. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=851.4s)]
*  A little diversion there to the governor of Minnesota. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=857.48s)]
*  Elon, though, Trump claimed that he was suffering from Trump derangement syndrome. So let's [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=860.8800000000001s)]
*  listen to that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=869.2s)]
*  I'll tell you, he's not the first. People leave my administration and they love us. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=871.5200000000001s)]
*  And then at some point, they miss it so badly. And some of them embrace it and some of them [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=880.96s)]
*  actually become hostile. I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=886.64s)]
*  I guess they call it. But we have it with others, too. They leave and they wake up in [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=891.2s)]
*  the morning and the glamour's gone. The whole world is different and they become hostile. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=896.2s)]
*  I don't know what it is. Someday you'll write a book about it and you'll let us know. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=903.2s)]
*  I think he's talking about Elon like he dismissed his side piece. Weigh in on this. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=908.2s)]
*  Yeah, so this one's complicated because on the one hand, he says that people leave and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=914.08s)]
*  then they get Trump derangement syndrome. No, they leave with their hair on fire usually [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=921.96s)]
*  because they're like, my God, I didn't know he was that crazy, right? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=926.88s)]
*  That's usually the number one reaction. People go in super right wing, want to support Trump. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=930.28s)]
*  And they think, man, this guy's got to figure it out. This is going to be great. They go [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=936.24s)]
*  in there like, wait, you don't read anything? All you do is watch Fox News and play golf [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=939.24s)]
*  and you're going to do 145% tariff. You can't sell anything at 145% tariff. You're going [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=947.76s)]
*  to knock it down to 50%. It doesn't matter. We can't sell anything at 50% tariff. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=953.8s)]
*  So if you're going to do tariff, make it targeted, specific, long-term, etc. No, he won't listen [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=959.0799999999999s)]
*  to any reason. So that's why everybody leaves frustrated at some point. Like, this is not [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=963.8s)]
*  a problem. On the other hand, is that what happened with Elon? I don't really think so. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=969.0s)]
*  I think Elon's a different case. I think Elon didn't get some of the goodies that he wanted. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=973.48s)]
*  And that's part of what's caused this problem in the first place. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=977.88s)]
*  A quick side note on Trump's attack on Tim Walz. Okay, that guy got done so dirty, Tim [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=980.96s)]
*  Walz did, mainly by Kamala Harris, who largely kept him in a basement. He's actually a populist [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=988.8s)]
*  and got a lot of good bills passed for the average person in Minnesota. We have a shirt [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=993.32s)]
*  at shoptyt.com called Balls to the Walls, which both Elon and Trump might want to buy [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=997.52s)]
*  now, based on this Balls to the Walls fight. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  But anyway, I like Tim Walz. I don't agree with Trump on that, but that's a side note. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  And so, but one of the main points here that he's making is I would have won without Elon. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1010.5600000000001s)]
*  And I think he would have won without Elon. So I got a split decision against Trump on [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1017.32s)]
*  this one, both for and against them. So I'm just gonna say that one is neutral. So let's [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1023.1999999999999s)]
*  go to the next one. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1031.48s)]
*  All right, so then Elon's still up three, two. Is that right, Cenk? Okay, I thought [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1032.56s)]
*  you would have maybe docked Trump a little bit, shaved something off of his score for [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1038.28s)]
*  some of that. But okay, Elon, furious, beyond. So here's what he put up on his platform X. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1041.72s)]
*  Without me, Trump would have lost the election. Dems would control the House, and the Republicans [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1048.28s)]
*  would be 51, 49 in the Senate. Such ingratitude. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1052.94s)]
*  So remember, Elon did donate $288 million. Again, thankful for that 2024 election. And [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1058.46s)]
*  America PAC, which Elon helped form, that was huge, most prominent get out the vote [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1066.5s)]
*  campaign for Trump. And now Elon is seemingly suggesting a full split from Trump. So let's [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1071.04s)]
*  put it up. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1077.38s)]
*  Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1078.4s)]
*  in the middle? Okay, so these are fighting words. But of course, Trump is going to have [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1083.48s)]
*  the last laugh and prove he will always have power over Elon. So let's put up truth social. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1087.74s)]
*  The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars is to terminate [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1095.0s)]
*  Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1101.0800000000002s)]
*  O-M-G. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it. Okay, is he or because Elon dropped [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1104.8799999999999s)]
*  this bombshell. Time to drop the really big bomb. Real Donald Trump is in the Epstein [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1117.8799999999999s)]
*  files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT. I [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1127.96s)]
*  don't know if we should pause there and keep going. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1136.96s)]
*  I mean, this is beyond hostile at this point. But we'll give you a little more. Somehow [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1138.88s)]
*  it gets even messier because Elon called for Trump to be impeached. He's been through that [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1144.16s)]
*  before responding to Ian Miles Chung on X. He says, yes, Trump should be impeached. JD [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1149.64s)]
*  Vance should replace him. That was the tweet from Ian. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1159.2800000000002s)]
*  Elon hasn't stopped tweeting about this since Trump made those initial comments this morning. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1163.88s)]
*  But some other things worth noting, he said include this. In light of the president's [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1169.0400000000002s)]
*  statement about cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1174.92s)]
*  its Dragon spacecraft immediately. Okay, that's gonna have some implications for some. Back [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1179.72s)]
*  and forth, the Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1188.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh my goodness, this is a marathon. Clash has also caused both Elon and Trump and their [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1193.1200000000001s)]
*  market prices to drop drastically. Shares of Trump Media and Technology Group dropped [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1199.68s)]
*  8%, Trump Coin down 12%, Tesla shares dropped 14%, losing $152.4 billion in market value, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1203.8000000000002s)]
*  the stock's biggest one day slide on record. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1212.6000000000001s)]
*  Can they even afford to keep going? If they keep going at this pace, right, using the [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1215.8400000000001s)]
*  biggest weapons they have against each other, who loses first? And will they both destroy [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1220.64s)]
*  each other like a nuclear bomb? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1226.64s)]
*  What this feels like, this feels like that gas station fight in Zoolander, where they [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1229.16s)]
*  were spraying the gas all over each other. And they light something and then right. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1237.0800000000002s)]
*  Hi. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1242.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of we've got a Zoolander situation on our hands here. So okay, now [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1243.52s)]
*  there's a lot to break down. So let me take it one by one as quickly as I can. So number [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1248.52s)]
*  one, Trump, Elon saying, I gave you basically $300 million. He didn't mention the number, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  but I gave you so much and this is great in gratitude and you wouldn't have won without [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1259.6399999999999s)]
*  me. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1265.12s)]
*  I think Trump would have won without him, although it would have been harder, of course, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1266.12s)]
*  the money definitely helped and the publicity and all that helped. So did Elon help? Yes. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1269.2s)]
*  Could Trump have won without him? Very likely, he won the popular vote, he won all seven [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1274.28s)]
*  swing states. But most importantly, no, as a big donor, you don't get to say, show me [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1277.88s)]
*  gratitude, give me subsidies, give me the head of NASA, give me whatever I want. It [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1284.88s)]
*  doesn't work that way. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1288.76s)]
*  Like I backed Bernie Sanders and I didn't expect anything in return. I backed him because [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1290.66s)]
*  I liked him and I thought he was the best candidate and had the best policies and the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1294.98s)]
*  best chance of implementing them. So saying that he's ungrateful for all of his campaign [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1298.72s)]
*  donations, which I basically consider bribery at large, is not the win that Elon thinks [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1305.02s)]
*  it is. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1309.78s)]
*  I'm scoring that one for Trump or mainly against Elon. So there is three-three. Then he calls [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1310.78s)]
*  for Trump's impeachment. Look, I voted against Trump. I think some of his constitutional [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1316.82s)]
*  actions or unconstitutional actions are terrible. Sure, have added Haas, but they're not gonna [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1322.1s)]
*  do impeachment. So since it's just a shot fired, but there's no right or wrong there [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1328.5s)]
*  in terms of, it's not like it's gonna happen, but I'm not counting that against Elon. That's [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1334.58s)]
*  just a random insult, nothing to score really in my opinion. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1340.18s)]
*  Then Trump says we should terminate all of Elon's contracts and subsidies. Well, we already [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1343.94s)]
*  have a website for that. It's called wheresourcut.com because we say, look, if contracts are one [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1348.5s)]
*  thing and so when Elon complains about, hey, I got a government contract with Dragon spacecraft [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1354.54s)]
*  to go to the International Space Station, that's true and that he's providing a service. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1359.5s)]
*  But when it comes to the subsidies, again, I don't know why we're giving to Exxon Mobil [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1363.48s)]
*  and I don't know why we're giving to Tesla or SpaceX or anyone else. So I'm not sure [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1367.96s)]
*  SpaceX is getting subsidies, but on wheresourcut.com, we actually have those facts for you guys [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1372.3600000000001s)]
*  and you can look up each Elon company and we'll put the link down below later on in [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1378.28s)]
*  the description box as well. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1383.0s)]
*  And so I have a simple answer to that. Yeah, cut all the subsidies. Stop making the average [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1384.92s)]
*  American pay money to the largest companies in the world. And if we're gonna do that, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1392.06s)]
*  the reason why it's called wheresourcut is, well, okay, then if I'm investing into your [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1397.7s)]
*  company as an American taxpayer, where's my cut? Give me a portion of Tesla. Give me a [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1401.3s)]
*  portion of Starlink. Give me a portion of SpaceX. Give me a portion of Exxon Mobil [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1406.5s)]
*  and Chevron. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1410.44s)]
*  Then we can all be rich. You don't wanna give, you only wanna take. I score that one for [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1411.44s)]
*  Trump or basically against Elon. No, you don't get to have subsidies just cuz you're a donor. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1416.34s)]
*  And so then we go to the Dragon Space spacecraft. Well, look, Elon's got every right to say, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1422.86s)]
*  I'm not providing that service anymore. And now how are you gonna get to the International [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1429.98s)]
*  Space Station? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1434.06s)]
*  And I don't know what the answer to that is because look, there's so many things in our [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1435.06s)]
*  government that's a disaster and we can't get them to work. So I don't know that that's [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1439.14s)]
*  a win for Elon though. I mean, there's a reason why the stock price went down. I mean, that [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1444.62s)]
*  was Tesla, but it's affecting all of his companies to the best that I could see. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1448.8999999999999s)]
*  And Tesla loses $142 billion, so it's hard to give Elon the win on that. Yes, he's technically [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1454.3s)]
*  correct. He can stop that and it would hurt America's ability to the space station, but [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1459.54s)]
*  it's also hurting his own company. So I'm gonna call that one a tie. And then on Epstein, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1464.46s)]
*  gigantic win for Elon on that one. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1470.42s)]
*  So I mean, there's things that people just don't say in public, even though they're super [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1473.38s)]
*  obvious. Trump met with Epstein at least seven times, was on his jet, I should say, at least [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1480.38s)]
*  seven times. Met with him dozens and dozens of times, has tons of pictures with him, said [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1487.66s)]
*  the only person who likes to party harder than me is Jeffrey Epstein, and he likes him [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1494.66s)]
*  young. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1499.5s)]
*  So yeah, that might be a reason why they're not releasing the Epstein files. I think there's [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1500.58s)]
*  another reason why they're not releasing the Epstein files. Neither the Democrats or the [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1505.3s)]
*  Republicans ever released those files. There's only one lobby strong enough to make sure [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1509.3s)]
*  that neither party releases those files. If Elon Musk goes in that direction, oh, Nelly, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1514.26s)]
*  cuz that's a whole different level of nuclear, right? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1520.26s)]
*  So he hasn't done that yet, but he hit Trump on the Epstein files. And it's true that Epstein [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1524.64s)]
*  files have not been released, and Donald Trump was good friends with Jeffrey Epstein. Major [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1528.94s)]
*  win for Elon there, we're tied at 4-4, leaving, maybe this is our last one, the recession. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1533.94s)]
*  So is Elon right that Trump's reckless tariffs will likely cause some sort of economic, significant [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1540.42s)]
*  economic downturn and potentially a recession in the second half of this year? Yes, I think [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1547.5s)]
*  that is likely to very likely. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1552.3400000000001s)]
*  So that puts Elon at 5 and Trump at 4. Do we have any others, Sharon? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1554.56s)]
*  Look, we can keep checking the various social media channels because I'm sure they're still [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1561.56s)]
*  at it right now and we're monitoring it. But can I just ask you, this is fun scoring it [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1567.12s)]
*  as this heavyweight bout with real implications, but my mind's going in some dark places. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1572.04s)]
*  Trump is reckless with information, with secrets. Elon was around in some key places, just carte [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1576.78s)]
*  blanche walking through the White House. I mean, what else can he do here? He has all [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1581.76s)]
*  of our secrets. I mean, he could release more, he could do more. And then I guess the second [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1585.48s)]
*  question I have for you is, is anything dead 100%? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1590.54s)]
*  I mean, little Marco Rubio is in the administration, JD Vans called Trump Hitler, and look now, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1594.64s)]
*  it's his VP, they're back in love. Do you see any kind of reconciliation possible in [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1600.76s)]
*  the near future? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1607.08s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a great point. So we should definitely end on those two things. Number [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1609.0s)]
*  one, can there be a reconciliation? Look, this is super ugly, right? Once you get to [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1614.8400000000001s)]
*  Epstein, it's hard to come back from Epstein, right? Calling for his impeachment. I mean, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1619.76s)]
*  it's saying I'm gonna end all of his contracts and subsidies. This is as ugly as it gets. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1626.0400000000002s)]
*  But Trump is a legendary flip-flopper. Nobody flip-flops like Donald Trump. I'm gonna do [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1631.42s)]
*  10% tips, no 145%, no 50%, no 30%, back to 10%, wait, we're pausing it, no%. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1638.98s)]
*  I mean, it goes on and on and on, nonstop, that's the whole taco thing, right? So it [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1645.22s)]
*  isn't Tuesday, but I guess it's Taco Thursday. So could they go back to getting along? Well, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1650.0600000000002s)]
*  they could get to an unsteady truce and they probably will at some point. I mean, is this [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1658.76s)]
*  really gonna go on for three and a half years where they're just blooding each other day [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1663.92s)]
*  in, day out? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1669.28s)]
*  That would be awesome, okay? But I don't know that we're gonna get that lucky. So it's hard [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1671.12s)]
*  to tell here cuz this is as brutal and bloody a fight as I have ever seen in politics. On [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1679.0s)]
*  hand, Trump is the biggest flip-flopper in politics and often changes his position. And [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1684.44s)]
*  that's how he thinks you make a deal. You do super heavy-handed insults and attacks, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1689.96s)]
*  and then you reach a deal and then you go back to hugs and kisses. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1696.48s)]
*  So because of Trump, it's not impossible that they could actually get back together. Elon [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1699.66s)]
*  not known so much for that, more digging in is what he's known for. But they both have [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1705.72s)]
*  huge outsized personalities, so that's super interesting. The second thing that you mentioned [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1712.16s)]
*  that is the most important of all is the budget itself. Are they actually gonna pass the budget? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1716.3600000000001s)]
*  What are they gonna do with the budget? So I know what Trump wants. Trump doesn't care [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1721.44s)]
*  about the debt or the deficit at all. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1726.0s)]
*  Now 1%, I mean, he's proven it spectacularly in two different terms. When there's an opportunity [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1728.72s)]
*  to add trillions and trillions to the debt, Trump always takes that opportunity, right? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1734.88s)]
*  And for Elon, my guess is he loves those tax cuts and Rand Paul is in his camp. And Rand [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1740.9s)]
*  Paul said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're keeping the tax cuts for the rich. That's [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1748.98s)]
*  the most important part. He's like, if a guy could just vote for that, I'd vote for it [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1753.38s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1756.9s)]
*  Brother, that would mean that instead of adding 2.4 trillion to the debt, you added 3.6 trillion [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1757.9s)]
*  to the debt. How does that make it any better? It makes it actually worse if you voted on [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1762.5800000000002s)]
*  just the tax cuts. So my guess is Elon wants the tax cuts, but he wanted his subsidies. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1766.46s)]
*  And even if you cut a bunch of subsidies and cut, here's the thing that's so frustrating, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1772.5s)]
*  Sharon. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1776.82s)]
*  And again, not only do Republicans not talk about it, but Democrats don't talk about it [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1777.82s)]
*  enough and the media almost never talks about it. Why is everybody just cutting for Medicaid [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1781.38s)]
*  and SNAP, etc.? So if you're MAGA and you say, well, I wanna cut for Medicaid and I [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1786.02s)]
*  want there to be a work requirement. Okay, but why don't you wanna cut all of the corporate [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1790.54s)]
*  subsidies? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1795.38s)]
*  The corporate subsidies are never mentioned. That's the hidden gem inside this fight, that [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1796.74s)]
*  both sides are now finally talking about, right, where all of the waste, fraud and abuse [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1802.1000000000001s)]
*  are is the corporate subsidies. Donors give money to Trump and Biden, and then they get [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1807.7600000000002s)]
*  billions in returns, and sometimes hundreds of billions in return, right? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1814.9s)]
*  That's where the great American robbery is. So are they gonna take out the corporate subsidies? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1820.5600000000002s)]
*  I have it at nearly a 0% chance. Because the rich and powerful want their tax cuts and [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1824.6999999999998s)]
*  they want their subsidies, what they'll probably do is cut more from the average person. Now, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1830.7399999999998s)]
*  there's a Republican senator talking about cutting from Medicare too. So they might cut [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1836.6599999999999s)]
*  more from the average guy. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1840.9399999999998s)]
*  They may take out one of the tax cuts for the average person, like either on tips or [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1842.6599999999999s)]
*  overtime, but they're never gonna touch the rich and they're never gonna touch corporations. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1846.78s)]
*  So my guess is, yes, this bill will pass. Yes, it'll get worse, not better. And yes, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1851.94s)]
*  it will add a massive amount to the deficit and the debt. And then finally, Sharon, of [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1859.06s)]
*  course it has to be noted for the record that interesting that they were both keeping this [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1864.74s)]
*  dirty laundry secret when Trump, I'll say anything, Elon, I'll say anything. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1870.2s)]
*  Well, which they did prove today to be fair, right? But back when they were together and [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1875.3s)]
*  when they were allies, they were planning that robbery together. So there was no talk [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1879.1s)]
*  of Epstein. There was no talk of Elon's subsidies. There was no talk of any of that stuff. And [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1884.4599999999998s)]
*  all of a sudden they fight and we find out they had put in a lot of subsidies for Elon. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1890.78s)]
*  And now he might take out those subsidies and government contracts. And some had already [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1896.2199999999998s)]
*  been taken out to be fair to Trump, like the electric vehicle one. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1901.02s)]
*  And we find out that Elon knew about Trump being in the Epstein files all along and didn't [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1907.74s)]
*  say anything and apparently didn't mind as long as he was making money with Trump. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1913.42s)]
*  It's crazy. Okay, they need that. Who's that Hollywood lawyer that the stars get disoqueened? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1918.06s)]
*  What's her name? Laura Wasserman Schultz? One of them needs to bring her on because [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1924.5s)]
*  this is bananas. It's bananas. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1928.38s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, but it does [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCOoM3ld5Ag&t=1931.72s)]
