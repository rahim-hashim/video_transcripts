# Is There A MAGA Civil War Underway? Cenk Hears From Two Conservative Podcasters
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU)
*  Now time for some headline thunderous chemistry! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=0.0s)]
*  You're smoking some of the best no God ever put breath in. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=30.0s)]
*  Thank God it's Friday. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=52.44s)]
*  Drop it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=82.44s)]
*  All right, power panel, Cenk Uygur, John Iadarola, Nina Turner, how you doing, Nina? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=112.44s)]
*  Great to be here with you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=130.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=131.68s)]
*  How's it going, Nina? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=132.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=133.68s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=134.68s)]
*  All right, Senator Nina Turner joining us. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=135.68s)]
*  All right, this is gonna be a great power panel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=137.88s)]
*  On my way in, I was thinking, okay, don't lose your cool, don't lose your cool, don't [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=141.48s)]
*  lose your cool. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=145.28s)]
*  Because we do have an Israel story and then the attacks against Mom Donnie are so racist, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=146.28s)]
*  I just can't take it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  All right, so we'll see what happens, but embrace her impact. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=153.92s)]
*  Keep your cool. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  I already told the whole crew like three hours ago, it's like Cenk's not gonna make it through [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  this without blowing up. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=162.56s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=163.56s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=164.56s)]
*  And I saw this super powerful movie last night that I'm gonna tell you guys more about later, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=165.56s)]
*  but let's get started. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=169.2s)]
*  Okay, let's do it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  Actually, we're gonna start off with this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  Actually, no, we can jump right into this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, this was a big one, wasn't it? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=176.96s)]
*  This was a big decision. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=179.76s)]
*  An amazing decision, one that we're very happy about. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=181.76s)]
*  This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=186.12s)]
*  the separation of powers and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=191.72s)]
*  injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=197.84s)]
*  The Supreme Court has stopped the presidency itself. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  That's what they've done. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=206.32s)]
*  And really, it's been an amazing period of time, this last hour. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=208.24s)]
*  Okay, so Grandpa's train of thought fell apart a little bit at the end there, but it is a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=215.44s)]
*  big day, not only for President Donald Trump, but any aspiring autocrat who wants the power [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=219.96s)]
*  to trample not only what Congress is constitutionally obligated to do, but the Supreme Court, lower [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=225.12s)]
*  courts as well. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  And so they announced earlier today that what he wants, which is an end to a lower court [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=231.12s)]
*  ruling that was temporarily blocking his bid to end birthright citizenship, he got it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=237.16000000000003s)]
*  And he got it not only in the birthright citizenship case, but effectively, it could be that for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=243.08s)]
*  all cases in which lower courts try to even temporarily block Donald Trump's executive [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=249.0s)]
*  decrees, they won't be able to do that in the future. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  And that has only the widest of implications. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=257.62s)]
*  So we're gonna get into all of it, the arguing, where we go from here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  But Cenk, what do you think? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=263.58s)]
*  Yeah, real quick, the substance of this decision is not that bad or important. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=264.58s)]
*  In fact, it doesn't even exist. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=270.3s)]
*  I'll explain that in a little bit after we give you all the details of the story. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=271.78s)]
*  But the process argument made here is a disaster. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=276.42s)]
*  So it's important why it's a disaster. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=281.32s)]
*  And that's what we're gonna explain to you after you get all the details first. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=284.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a disaster on seven different levels. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=287.88s)]
*  And hearing Donald Trump announce it as a win for the Constitution and the separation [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=291.88s)]
*  of powers, I mean, that's your Orwellian, bizarro world reversal of the truth. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=295.64s)]
*  And Donald Trump here, of course, as president, not happy that these nationwide injections [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=302.4s)]
*  are happening. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=306.84s)]
*  And I would love to see one example of him when he wasn't president arguing against [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=307.88s)]
*  a nationwide injunction stopping a president. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=313.36s)]
*  If a nationwide injunction stopped Joe Biden, did he ever say that that was a court exceeding [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=315.2s)]
*  its authority? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=319.76s)]
*  No, of course, they cheered it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=320.76s)]
*  They thought it was the best thing ever. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=322.24s)]
*  And in this case, they have their conservative supermajority on the court. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  And so most of the time, the right is gonna get what it wants. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=326.92s)]
*  And this is what happened here, six, three ruling, as we've come to expect, the liberal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=330.0s)]
*  justices dissenting. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, Cenk mentioned substance. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=336.0s)]
*  This does not actually rule on whether birthright citizenship will continue to be a constitutionally [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=338.88s)]
*  guaranteed right as it has been for over 150 years. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=344.52s)]
*  They'll get to that at some point, I suppose. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=348.48s)]
*  This is just gonna allow after a 30-day pause, the resumption of whatever it is that Trump [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=351.72s)]
*  decides to do when it comes to birthright citizenship. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=356.86s)]
*  So it is looking like in the majority of states, it will not be a right for a day or a month [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=359.32s)]
*  or two years or forever, however long it takes the Supreme Court to eventually circle back [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=364.96s)]
*  around to this crucial topic. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=369.32s)]
*  But don't get too down on them. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=371.56s)]
*  It does take a lot of time to figure out whether something that's clearly stipulated in the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=373.68s)]
*  Constitution is in fact constitutional. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=377.8s)]
*  Can you tell that I'm not happy about this? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=380.4s)]
*  So here is what Amy Coney Barrett said, writing for the majority in this case. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=382.04s)]
*  By the end of the Biden administration, we had reached a state of affairs where almost [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=387.0s)]
*  every major presidential act was immediately frozen by a federal district court. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=390.02s)]
*  The trend has continued. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=394.12s)]
*  During the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, district courts issued approximately [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=395.36s)]
*  25 universal injunctions. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=400.0s)]
*  As the number of universal injunctions has increased, so too has the importance of the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=402.1s)]
*  issue. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=406.72s)]
*  Basically saying there that now both sides are just, they're doing too much of this and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=407.72s)]
*  judges at the lower levels are allowing it too often. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=412.68s)]
*  And then she throws her hands up in the air and says, it's impossible for us to quickly [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=417.08s)]
*  adjudicate whether an executive order action is on its face explicitly unconstitutional. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=421.74s)]
*  So rather than engaging on a case by case basis with something like two dozen lower [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=428.3s)]
*  court rulings, instead we'll just allow the president to do effectively whatever he wants. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=432.92s)]
*  Seems like a dereliction of their duty. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  So that's the majority. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=440.0s)]
*  Justice Sotomayor writing for the minority in this case says, with the stroke of a pen, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=441.5s)]
*  the president has made a solemn mockery of our Constitution. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=446.38s)]
*  Rather than stand firm, the court gives way. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=449.82s)]
*  The court's decision is nothing less than an open invitation for the government to bypass [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=452.65999999999997s)]
*  the Constitution. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=457.54s)]
*  This is so, Sotomayor goes on to say, because the administration may be able to enforce [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=458.92s)]
*  a policy even when it has been challenged and found to be unconstitutional by a lower [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=462.62s)]
*  court. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=468.02s)]
*  And by the way, we've already had many instances in just the past few months where the Trump [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=469.02s)]
*  administration has made very clear that even when a court order is still standing, they're [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=472.42s)]
*  just not going to abide by it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=477.53999999999996s)]
*  We found out that one of his nominees for, I believe, an appeals court judicial position [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=478.94s)]
*  was advising the lawyers in the DOJ, just don't pay attention to it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=484.62s)]
*  You don't have to follow literally any of that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=488.06s)]
*  So we know, and the members of the SCOTUS know, exactly what the Trump regime's approach [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=489.98s)]
*  to the separation of powers and in particular, the judiciary is. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=495.65999999999997s)]
*  They know all of that, and yet they are still delivering, not every single time, but in [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=498.9s)]
*  the vast majority of cases, more power to the Trump administration. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=503.98s)]
*  Perhaps the administration and American history least qualified or deserving of the increased [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=508.14s)]
*  powers that are being delegated to them. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=513.6999999999999s)]
*  So we have more, we have videos, but we should probably jump into discussion. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=515.54s)]
*  Yeah, so first thing that I want everybody to recognize is John mentioned it, but there, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=518.14s)]
*  I wanna double down on it so people don't panic. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=523.92s)]
*  This is not to take away birthright citizenship. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=528.02s)]
*  They have not decided anything about that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=530.22s)]
*  They have remanded it to the lower courts to go back up. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=533.18s)]
*  They do this all the time. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=536.5s)]
*  They send it back down to have it go back up, okay? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=538.1s)]
*  And so because they're ruling quickly theoretically, right? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=541.4s)]
*  And so they have another 30 days here, and then they'll go into effect. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=545.66s)]
*  Okay, so and again, the birthright citizenship ban is not adjudicated, right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=549.66s)]
*  They have not made a decision. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=556.58s)]
*  Okay, so then what is gonna happen? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=557.82s)]
*  Well, this is the awful part of this ruling, and it's preposterous. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=559.82s)]
*  And I have a couple theories as to why they did this. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=564.58s)]
*  So let me give you an example. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=567.5s)]
*  So they're saying no nationwide injunction, even if the president seems to do something [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=569.02s)]
*  blatantly, obviously constitutional. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=572.7s)]
*  So this is blatantly and obviously constitutional why birthright citizenship is in the 14th [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=575.18s)]
*  Amendment. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=579.82s)]
*  It's been adjudicated by the court multiple times. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=580.82s)]
*  There's massive precedent over it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=583.14s)]
*  There's no question about it, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=584.82s)]
*  So okay, here's another thing that's been adjudicated a lot, which is torture is a violation [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=586.98s)]
*  of the 8th Amendment, right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=591.46s)]
*  And so if the president says, you know what, I'm gonna start doing torture now. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=594.26s)]
*  You can't do a nationwide injunction on it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=599.74s)]
*  So what they would have to do is, according to this ruling, only the people who sued who [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=602.18s)]
*  had already been tortured, or the states that say, hey, I would not like to torture, it [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=606.7s)]
*  applies to them, an injunction applies to them, okay? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=612.9s)]
*  But not to any of the other states, and not to the people who are about to get tortured. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=616.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay, that makes no sense. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=621.1s)]
*  Do we have a constitution or don't we have a constitution? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=623.66s)]
*  You can't say, the constitution applies only to people who sue. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=626.18s)]
*  Wait, did you get it? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=629.26s)]
*  The second problem, that means now there's going to be a flood of lawsuits, cuz nobody [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=631.1s)]
*  wants to get tortured, right? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=636.3s)]
*  So now that's a comparison analogy, but in this case, there is already a flood of lawsuits, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=638.26s)]
*  because people are like, okay, well, I was born in America, or my kid's about to be born [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=645.06s)]
*  in America, I'm pregnant. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=650.4599999999999s)]
*  Or my kid just got born in America, but I'm not in one of those states, so now I have [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=653.18s)]
*  to go file a lawsuit to make sure that my kid's rights aren't taken away. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=657.9799999999999s)]
*  We could have a ridiculous, enormous amount of lawsuits. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=662.38s)]
*  By the way, some states have already, and groups, and human rights groups have already [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=666.5799999999999s)]
*  started suing, right? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=669.78s)]
*  So what are we doing here? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=671.3199999999999s)]
*  This is so dumb. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  So look, I think that the right way to do this is, I get the issue of the nationwide [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=673.78s)]
*  injunction. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=679.5799999999999s)]
*  You know what I always do, show another foot, right? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=680.5799999999999s)]
*  So Biden had a lot of his stuff blocked by nationwide injunctions, and I didn't like [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=683.58s)]
*  some of the stuff that was blocked. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=688.94s)]
*  I wanted it to go through. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=690.94s)]
*  Student debt relief was one that was blocked, right? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=692.94s)]
*  And it takes forever to get out of the block. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=695.0600000000001s)]
*  So they should have a rule, this is a fair thing, that if, hey, if you're gonna do a [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=697.08s)]
*  nationwide injunction on some constitutional issues that are necessary, then the case gets [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=700.22s)]
*  significantly expedited, right? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=704.78s)]
*  Okay, that makes sense, because hey, is it constitutional or not? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=707.26s)]
*  We gotta adjudicate that right away, and we have to stop the president from doing unconstitutional [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=711.66s)]
*  things in the meanwhile. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=717.12s)]
*  But if it turns out it's not unconstitutional, then he can go forward. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=719.06s)]
*  So that makes sense, this doesn't. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=722.3s)]
*  They're gonna reverse this at some point. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=724.0s)]
*  I don't know how long it'll take, but this will clog up the courts. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=725.4599999999999s)]
*  It's a super dumb decision. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=728.6999999999999s)]
*  So why do they do it? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=730.64s)]
*  Here's my very generous theory, and you're feel free to totally not believe it, and we'll [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=732.02s)]
*  see how it actually plays out. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=738.38s)]
*  Is that since what Trump is doing is so obviously unconstitutional, they're gonna have to rule [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=740.98s)]
*  against it when it comes back up to the Supreme Court. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=746.4200000000001s)]
*  Otherwise they're just throwing out a huge chunk of precedent and how we interpret the [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=749.4200000000001s)]
*  Constitution in America. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=756.62s)]
*  It'll have enormous ramifications of the substance, right? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=758.14s)]
*  No, I hear you, I hear you. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=761.82s)]
*  That's why I say everyone's free to totally not believe me on this one. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=764.02s)]
*  Okay, you're all released, okay? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=768.34s)]
*  No, seriously, I think that they have to rule against them. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=770.6999999999999s)]
*  So part of what I think Roberts is doing here, in my opinion, is splitting the baby and going, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=774.02s)]
*  on the procedural stuff, Donald Trump is so right, so right. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=779.86s)]
*  Now don't get mad at us later when we tell you that he doesn't know what the hell he's [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=783.9399999999999s)]
*  talking about when it comes to the Constitution. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=786.78s)]
*  So that feels like a Roberts type of compromise, but the good part hasn't happened yet, only [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=788.88s)]
*  the bad part has happened. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=795.48s)]
*  So Nina, what do you think? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=796.8s)]
*  Well, Cenk, I hope you're right about that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=799.3s)]
*  It's hard for me to put faith in Roberts, but what you're saying, it makes sense, it [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=802.2199999999999s)]
*  makes too much sense. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=807.18s)]
*  So I hope that you're right. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=808.18s)]
*  But on the face of what is happening right now, the point that John was making, the court [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=809.4599999999999s)]
*  totally abdicated its responsibility, cut the legs out from under other courts. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=813.6999999999999s)]
*  And I really do think that this court is calling President Donald J Trump their daddy. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=820.76s)]
*  I really do. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=825.98s)]
*  I mean, as sick as all of this is with the daddy stuff, the t-shirts and all of that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=826.98s)]
*  But it just feels like this, and this man is celebrating. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=833.02s)]
*  You got people who are hungry, people who need healthcare, all the things that this [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=837.54s)]
*  president could be doing with his power. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=844.14s)]
*  But he steps up to a mic in the press room to celebrate a so-called victory, which is [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=847.1s)]
*  really no victory at all for the vast majority of people in this country. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=853.0200000000001s)]
*  Because they come for immigrants, eventually they're coming for everybody else. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=858.5400000000001s)]
*  I mean, there is no red line for Donald J Trump. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=863.0200000000001s)]
*  This is not good. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=866.74s)]
*  By the way, I have been dreading later in the show when I have to present the daddy [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=867.74s)]
*  story and ask Senator Nina Turner to talk about it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=872.82s)]
*  And she actually brought it up first. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=876.34s)]
*  So now I feel a little bit better about that whole thing. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=877.62s)]
*  Yeah, so look, my concern is that like Amy Coney Barrett's, yeah, the Republicans did [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=880.5799999999999s)]
*  this a lot to Biden. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=887.9s)]
*  Yeah, but can the Supreme Court not tell the difference between a frivolous attempt to [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=889.3399999999999s)]
*  block something that is definitely within the power of the executive branch and something [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=894.18s)]
*  that seems intentionally designed to violate the Constitution? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=898.88s)]
*  And it's not even just this. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=902.62s)]
*  It's not even just like they found the birthright citizenship and they were like, yeah, you [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=903.62s)]
*  know what, some of the white supremacists of voters for us don't like this, so we're [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=906.54s)]
*  gonna get rid of this. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=909.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're dispatching the military to US citizens. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=910.1s)]
*  They've now taken over 250 miles of the southern border and said, yeah, that's actually all [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=912.94s)]
*  of a military base, so the military can arrest migrants in there. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=918.22s)]
*  They're case after case, they're just trying to find the few remaining limitations on executive [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=922.38s)]
*  power and knock them down. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=928.14s)]
*  This is where the Supreme Court has to act expeditiously, particularly in cases of life [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=930.0s)]
*  and death. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=935.34s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's the case that they do end up ruling on this in a month. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=936.34s)]
*  And it never goes into effect or very soon after that. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=939.66s)]
*  But when you combine the willingness of Donald Trump to now start choosing who gets to be [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=942.9399999999999s)]
*  a citizen and who doesn't, scary in the first place, with his nonstop horniness to deport [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=947.78s)]
*  people, you could have kids that are born that should by rights be citizens but won't [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=953.66s)]
*  be the only possible protection they have under this lawless regime. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=958.06s)]
*  To not be sent to El Salvador or South Sudan or alligator Alcatraz or Guantanamo, and then [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=962.5s)]
*  he deports them. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=968.54s)]
*  And the Supreme Court, we're just waiting around. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=969.54s)]
*  I hope they get back in session and pick this up. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=971.46s)]
*  But maybe the kid is now in South Sudan. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=974.02s)]
*  So what's gonna happen once they get their citizenship retroactively reapplied? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=976.68s)]
*  The Trump administration is gonna fly him back over? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=981.26s)]
*  Boy, I hope they weren't assaulted or robbed or sexually abused or murdered in the meantime. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=983.66s)]
*  If there's any time where the Supreme Court has to act, it's the easiest thing in the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=988.74s)]
*  world. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=993.34s)]
*  If in four years, President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez signs an executive order that just says, we'll [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=994.34s)]
*  by the way, y'all can't own guns anymore. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=998.94s)]
*  Do you think the Supreme Court's gonna be like, well, let's not be hasty. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1001.58s)]
*  No nationwide injunctions and we'll think about it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1005.4200000000001s)]
*  We'll get back to you in two years. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1007.5s)]
*  You know, damn sure they're not gonna do that. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1009.38s)]
*  They acted quicker on student debt relief than something that seems designed to give [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1011.3000000000001s)]
*  the double middle finger to the Constitution. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1015.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're stealing my thunder and you're stealing the thunder of one of the members [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1017.74s)]
*  that I was about to- [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1021.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1022.74s)]
*  What's that? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1023.74s)]
*  On Twitch, DrenchedWildfire said, seems like a really bad precedent for the GOP's agenda [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1024.74s)]
*  to set for President AOC. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1029.7s)]
*  Okay, so the reason I wanted to read that is similar to what you said, John, but I'll [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1031.94s)]
*  make a prediction on it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1036.86s)]
*  I know procedurally that this will lead to a giant mess. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1038.38s)]
*  It's totally untenable. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1041.64s)]
*  They'll have to reverse themselves on this decision, right? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1043.14s)]
*  Just in time for- [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1045.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1046.6200000000001s)]
*  So as I was, you were talking, John, and I'm reading DrenchedWildfire's comment, I thought, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1047.6200000000001s)]
*  I know when they're gonna reverse it. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1052.3s)]
*  As soon as there's a Democratic president and they need a nationwide injunction on something, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1053.86s)]
*  they're like, well, it turns out this is a procedural mess. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1057.9799999999998s)]
*  Cenk was right, we're reversing it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1060.82s)]
*  I'm sure they'll throw that in. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1063.86s)]
*  And then I'm gonna do one last member for me, at least, John Bagino on tyt.com, right? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1064.86s)]
*  Wrote in, already funny. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1070.1399999999999s)]
*  If we get rid of birthright citizenship, what claim do any of us have to being an American? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1071.3s)]
*  Well, so that leads to two points. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1076.34s)]
*  I'm gonna feel really good about this, cuz I feel like naturalized citizens should have [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1078.26s)]
*  the same rights to everyone else, including the right to run for president. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1083.42s)]
*  But it turns out, now we have more rights than you guys. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1088.0200000000002s)]
*  Because none of you are citizens anymore if the substance of this stays. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1091.46s)]
*  By definition, you all kind of have to prove that you had American parents or some other [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1097.14s)]
*  documentation. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1102.3400000000001s)]
*  Whereas naturalized citizens, by definition, are naturalized, we already proved it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1103.6200000000001s)]
*  We have the documentation. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1107.3400000000001s)]
*  So I'm gonna need to see all your papers, okay? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1108.8600000000001s)]
*  Think about how ridiculous that is, because in the states that didn't sue, right now, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1112.42s)]
*  they have to start asking the parents, are you American or not? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1119.5800000000002s)]
*  And there's no way to verify. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1124.0600000000002s)]
*  And there's no system for the doctors or nurses or the hospital to verify. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1126.9s)]
*  So they don't know what to write on the birth certificate. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1131.48s)]
*  So monumentally dumb. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1135.74s)]
*  So there's going to be potentially thousands and thousands of kids that have birth certificates [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1137.88s)]
*  that are unclear as to whether they're US citizens or not. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1143.3200000000002s)]
*  And then what are you gonna do with all those cases? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1147.5800000000002s)]
*  This is so dumb, it hurts the mind to think about it. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  All right, last word goes to Nina. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1153.68s)]
*  Thanks, Gene. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1155.8000000000002s)]
*  I was thinking about the administrative nightmare. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1156.8000000000002s)]
*  It is a nightmare, but you think about the amount of money that hospitals are gonna have [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1159.24s)]
*  to spend. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1163.6000000000001s)]
*  Or counties will have to spend to create a system to be in line with this dumbness. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1165.24s)]
*  And then another point I wanna make, what good is a lifetime appointment? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1174.36s)]
*  You're supposed to have courage, right? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1177.76s)]
*  I thought, have a little extra courage, cuz I think if you run for office, you should [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1179.24s)]
*  have courage anyway. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1182.9599999999998s)]
*  Don't worry so much about the next election, do all that you can in the one that you just [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1184.36s)]
*  won. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1187.9199999999998s)]
*  But especially when you have a lifetime appointment, you're supposed to be able to do more of the [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1189.24s)]
*  right thing. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1194.4s)]
*  But this particular Supreme Court has shown time and time again that it is not willing [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1195.4s)]
*  to do so. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1199.68s)]
*  I mean, they act like their names on the ballot or something. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1200.68s)]
*  Am I missing something? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1202.88s)]
*  Do they still have lifetime appointments? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1203.88s)]
*  It feels like longer than one lifetime. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1206.72s)]
*  Yeah, they always, whenever there's a Republican president, they're always feeling out public [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1208.76s)]
*  opinion and stuff like that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1213.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1215.72s)]
*  Yeah, but whatever it's, anything related to corporations, money and politics, they're [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1216.72s)]
*  like, who cares about public opinion? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1220.44s)]
*  No, you guys don't have a democracy anymore. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1221.76s)]
*  You're now human beings and you could spend unlimited money bribing our politicians, go [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1223.96s)]
*  ahead. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1228.08s)]
*  Okay, then they never check the polls, cuz that poll's at 7% in popularity, but well. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1229.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, we're gonna take a break. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1234.32s)]
*  As we go to the break, I wanna give the conservatives an additional thing to think about. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1236.3600000000001s)]
*  Not only the precedent this is setting for President Buttigieg or whatever, who will [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1240.0s)]
*  not be bound by lower court decisions. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1243.92s)]
*  But also, Donald Trump announced in his little victory speech today that one of the reasons [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1246.32s)]
*  he's right about birthright citizenship is because it was only intended to apply to newly [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1251.0800000000002s)]
*  freed slaves. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1256.2s)]
*  Now, obviously, it doesn't say that in the Constitution, but he's saying ignore the literal [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1257.2s)]
*  text of the Constitution and add whatever context you want. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1261.88s)]
*  That is the official position of your dear leader. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1265.8000000000002s)]
*  I think that we can run with that in the future. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1268.3200000000002s)]
*  Especially for the Second Amendment. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1270.48s)]
*  Exactly, lots changed since then. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1272.2s)]
*  Anyway, so we're gonna take a break. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1274.4s)]
*  We'll be back after this. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1276.2s)]
*  All right, so you got a message for John Iderill? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1277.2s)]
*  Tell him to be nice to me. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1279.08s)]
*  All right, let's go to our members tyt.com. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1309.08s)]
*  Chocolate addiction dragon says happy Power Panel Friday, dragons. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1325.84s)]
*  What a great panel with dragon daddy, black pearl dragon, and justice dragon. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1328.24s)]
*  I'll keep the chocolate flowing for all. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1332.4399999999998s)]
*  Boy, with the bitterness of politics, I do declare we need multiple sweet jaysters to [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1334.24s)]
*  get the taste out of our mouths. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1338.04s)]
*  I like that you're really living up to your handle. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1339.92s)]
*  And I appreciate all the shout outs. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1342.72s)]
*  Doodle dragon Emron writes in, pow pow Power Panel. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1347.6399999999999s)]
*  Love you tyt. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1350.8s)]
*  It was a stolen moment in time meeting you, Cenk, and the filmmakers of Gaza Journalists [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1351.8s)]
*  Under Fire. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1354.8799999999999s)]
*  Thank you for hosting such an incredibly powerful film. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1355.8799999999999s)]
*  I need to draw something about that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1358.3999999999999s)]
*  So the reason he says I need to draw something about that because he's the one who's drawn [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1360.28s)]
*  the ceasefire shirt and the vote shirt that we have on shoptyt.com. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1365.68s)]
*  I think their works, I mean, not I think, they are works of art. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1370.72s)]
*  And you should check that out. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1374.72s)]
*  And if you get the pin, by the way, 100% of the proceeds goes to fund to help Palestinian [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1376.2s)]
*  children recover from this war. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1383.16s)]
*  And so real quick, I wanted to tell you about that. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1386.24s)]
*  So if Gaza Journalists Under Fire is a brave new film, new movie, that's what we saw here [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1389.0400000000002s)]
*  in LA yesterday, standing room only crowd, it was amazing. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1395.28s)]
*  It's only 41 minutes, but it's the most powerful 41 minutes you'll ever see. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1398.44s)]
*  I challenge any supporter of Israel's current actions in Gaza to watch that movie. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1403.96s)]
*  If after that movie they're still in favor of it, I'll be shocked, stunned. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1410.4s)]
*  Because that movie is so powerful. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1417.4s)]
*  I mean, I don't know that there was a single person in the room that wasn't crying at that. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1419.04s)]
*  And it's not just about the journalist. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1423.48s)]
*  So what you can do, guys, it's free. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1426.3200000000002s)]
*  You get a screening and then you could invite people to your house and watch it together, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1429.0400000000002s)]
*  okay? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1433.4s)]
*  And if you haven't watched it, you really, even with all of our coverage, I'm not sure [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1434.4s)]
*  that you know exactly what's going on without seeing the devastation with your own eyes. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1438.3000000000002s)]
*  So bravenewfilms.org, bravenewfilms.org, okay? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1443.94s)]
*  That's where you go. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1448.68s)]
*  You ask for the free screening, boom, okay? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1449.68s)]
*  And you can watch it and you can bring friends over. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1451.5600000000002s)]
*  So Robert Greenwald's an American treasure. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1454.0800000000002s)]
*  He's an unbelievable guy. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1457.52s)]
*  By the way, in the movie, there were Holocaust survivors who were practically begging Israel, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1459.24s)]
*  please don't, please stop. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1464.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1466.92s)]
*  Stop, right? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1467.92s)]
*  So it's just really powerful. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1469.76s)]
*  And Imran, thanks for coming out, brother, appreciate it. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1472.66s)]

*  All right, let's go to the next story. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1619.1599999999999s)]
*  I have nothing to really add to that. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1620.36s)]
*  The Italians came over and nobody had any problems with it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1622.04s)]
*  So we didn't cause any problems either. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1624.8s)]
*  Anyway, okay, well, we were LOLing a moment ago. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1628.08s)]
*  We're gonna have to stop doing that for a little bit, because this is one of the worst [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1632.12s)]
*  stories you're gonna have heard in quite a while. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1634.9199999999998s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1636.52s)]
*  The headline is chilling. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1637.52s)]
*  IDF soldiers ordered to shoot deliberately at unarmed Gazans waiting for humanitarian [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1640.3999999999999s)]
*  aid. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1645.76s)]
*  It seems everyone, including ordinary hungry civilians, are deemed to be targets. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1646.76s)]
*  The idea is actually communicate the Gazan population by fire, by fired alive ammunition. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1651.24s)]
*  As you saw right there, we're learning horrific new details about the IDF's recent conduct [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1662.56s)]
*  in Gaza, thanks to a damning report from Israeli newspaper, Haaretz. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1667.04s)]
*  And as the journalist was saying right there, the IDF was ordered by their leadership to [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1671.52s)]
*  communicate with totally unarmed, peaceful Palestinians by firing at them with live ammunition [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1676.4399999999998s)]
*  as a policy going forward. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1683.6799999999998s)]
*  And these details are horrific. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1686.56s)]
*  The numbers are terrible, but we're gonna run through all of it because not nearly enough [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1689.06s)]
*  people are paying attention to this story anymore, particularly with what's going on [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1693.22s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1696.82s)]
*  But the situation there remains as horrific as anywhere in the world, and the numbers [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1698.26s)]
*  are climbing every single day. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1702.82s)]
*  And so these aid centers that have been the site of near daily massacres are run by the [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1705.34s)]
*  Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1710.12s)]
*  It's been in the Gaza Strip since May. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1712.74s)]
*  It's an organization that was set up by Israel working with US evangelicals and private security [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1715.54s)]
*  contractors. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1721.3799999999999s)]
*  It's staffed by American and Palestinian workers and then secured by the IDF from a few hundred [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1722.58s)]
*  meters away. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1728.1399999999999s)]
*  And since they've opened just one month ago, there have been 19 different shooting incidents [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1730.02s)]
*  there. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1735.3s)]
*  And according to the Gaza Health Ministry, 549 people have already been killed in just [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1736.3s)]
*  one month near these aid centers. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1741.82s)]
*  It's waiting for food, the small amount of food that is allowed through when enough food [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1744.82s)]
*  exists for every single man, woman and children there to be perfectly fine, but they don't [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1749.86s)]
*  let it in. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1754.82s)]
*  And then when it comes in, you are risking your life every single day going to get it. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1755.82s)]
*  Over 4,000 people have been wounded and we don't know for sure what these numbers are. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1760.86s)]
*  That's what it's believed. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1766.3s)]
*  And those numbers are so insane. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1767.3s)]
*  I mean, I was recently watching Andor and they wanted to create a fictional scenario [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1770.7s)]
*  that would drill home how cruel and evil the regime was. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1776.7s)]
*  And they had a smaller massacre than that. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1781.78s)]
*  And that was enough for people to understand who the bad guy in that story was. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1784.1399999999999s)]
*  And that number will be higher tomorrow and it'll be higher the day after that. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1788.1s)]
*  And if you're a Palestinian in the area, there's nothing you can do but continue to go to the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1793.1s)]
*  place where you just might be murdered because otherwise you and your family will likely [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1797.58s)]
*  starve to death. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1802.3s)]
*  And so this is not just a series of accidents or miscommunications, as Haaretz reported. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1804.02s)]
*  This is the policy. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1809.6599999999999s)]
*  This is working as it is supposed to. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1811.12s)]
*  According to officers and soldiers who served there, this is not just the people being murdered [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1813.62s)]
*  saying this. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1818.6599999999999s)]
*  This is those serving in this area. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1819.6599999999999s)]
*  The idea fires at people who arrive before opening hours to prevent them from approaching [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1821.5s)]
*  or again after the centers close to disperse them. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1826.38s)]
*  Since some of the shooting incidents occurred at night ahead of the opening, it's possible [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1829.38s)]
*  that some civilians couldn't see the boundaries of the designated area. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1833.22s)]
*  Others might have believed that worst case scenario they would be told to leave not shot [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1837.46s)]
*  by the military. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1842.42s)]
*  And so a lot of miscommunications here sort of understandably. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1844.0200000000002s)]
*  One soldier said, it's a killing field where I was stationed between one and five people [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1847.96s)]
*  were killed every day. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1853.0600000000002s)]
*  They're treated like a hostile force. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1855.1s)]
*  No crowd control measures, no tear gas, just live fire with everything imaginable. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1857.28s)]
*  Heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1862.06s)]
*  Then once the center opens, the shooting stops and they know they can approach. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1865.5s)]
*  Our form of communication is gunfire. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1869.7199999999998s)]
*  We open fire early in the morning if someone tries to get in line from a few hundred meters [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1872.84s)]
*  away and sometimes we just charge them from close range. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1876.32s)]
*  But there's no danger to the forces. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1879.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm not aware of a single instance of return fire. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1882.1s)]
*  There's no enemy, no weapons. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1886.54s)]
*  This is not where they over exaggerate a threat. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1890.3s)]
*  Someone threw a rock so they needed to blow up a building and kill 100 civilians or whatever. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1893.72s)]
*  They're not even pretending that there's a threat. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1897.98s)]
*  They just don't want to talk to the people. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1900.7s)]
*  They don't want to communicate with them, see them as humans. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1902.86s)]
*  So instead, you shoot them, you kill one, two, four, seven people a day, and then the [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1906.42s)]
*  others I guess will get the message. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1912.02s)]
*  And so this is not like us reporting on, hey, the Guardian looked into it and six months [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1914.14s)]
*  ago there was a bad massacre. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1919.16s)]
*  It could be happening as we do this show. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1921.02s)]
*  And by the time The Young Turks goes live on Monday, it will have happened multiple [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1923.9s)]
*  times again. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1927.8600000000001s)]
*  And they are hoping, and we'll get more into the propaganda aspect of this, they are hoping [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1928.8600000000001s)]
*  that nobody gives a damn about this story anymore. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1932.8200000000002s)]
*  Doesn't care at all about the ever growing list of people who have been killed just desperately [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1935.7s)]
*  trying to feed their families. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1939.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so lots of devastating facts here. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1941.62s)]
*  First of all, when you target civilians on purpose, that has a name. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1944.58s)]
*  It's called being a terrorist. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1949.46s)]
*  And so what I'm sick of is the racism in American media where if it's a Muslim that does something, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1951.54s)]
*  terrorism instantly. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1957.8999999999999s)]
*  Half the time they don't even check to see if it's military or civilians. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1958.8999999999999s)]
*  By the way, did you know that out of the 1200 killed in Israel on October 7th, about 400 [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1962.94s)]
*  were military? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1967.5800000000002s)]
*  So it's still a despicable act. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1968.94s)]
*  They still killed over 800 civilians, but they just lump it all in. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1971.3s)]
*  Even if you kill Israeli military, you're not allowed to do that, you're a terrorist. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1974.6200000000001s)]
*  But Israel can kill your civilians on purpose. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1978.02s)]
*  And no, they're not a terrorist state, because that only applies to Muslims. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1981.98s)]
*  So it's just a racist word. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1985.42s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything anymore, it's trash. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1986.68s)]
*  Unless you say no, no, no, yes, from now on, we're calling Israel a terrorist state, because [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1988.8999999999999s)]
*  they are definitely killing civilians on purpose. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1993.8999999999999s)]
*  You know the daddy's unfortunately theme here, the program they have where they wait for [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=1996.58s)]
*  somebody that an AI picked to go home that they think might be connected to someone who [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2003.9399999999998s)]
*  else is connected to someone who was Hamas at some point. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2009.56s)]
*  Again, it's AI picking, they have no idea, okay? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2013.34s)]
*  And they wait for them to go home so that they could kill their entire family and their [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2016.74s)]
*  children along with them. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2021.82s)]
*  So people who target children and civilians on purpose are terrorists, and that is the [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2023.78s)]
*  IDF. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2029.74s)]
*  It's indisputable. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2030.88s)]
*  The only reason why you would argue it is if you're racist and say, yeah, no, only Muslims [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2032.14s)]
*  get called that. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2036.32s)]
*  Okay, so I don't wanna hear anybody being offended about anti-Semitism. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2037.78s)]
*  No, I get to be racist towards you, but you don't get to be accurate in your labels against [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2043.7s)]
*  me. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2047.86s)]
*  Okay, so none of that crap. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2048.86s)]
*  Okay, now let's talk about the wanton slaughter that Israel does in this despicable genocide, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2049.86s)]
*  okay? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2055.7s)]
*  So this is straight out of the textbook genocide situation. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2056.7s)]
*  I've told you this before, Serbanitza was considered genocide by the UN and by all scholars. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2062.86s)]
*  About 8,000 Muslims were killed, so a much lower number than here in Israel. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2070.62s)]
*  And they targeted Muslims just like Israel's targeting Palestinians. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2076.46s)]
*  And they did the same exact trick. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2080.1s)]
*  And the soldiers explained later in Serbanitza, the Serb soldiers, we realized that if we [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2082.5s)]
*  starved them, it would be easier to kill them. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2088.42s)]
*  Because then when they came to get the food that we brought them, they were sitting ducks. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2091.1s)]
*  And then we just killed their civilians that were coming out for food. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2095.94s)]
*  That's exactly what Israel's doing here. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2099.6s)]
*  If you think that all of this is self-defense, you're a terrible person. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2103.16s)]
*  It's not self-defense at all. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2107.66s)]
*  October 7th was two years ago. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2109.44s)]
*  They're still claiming self-defense as they destroyed or damaged 92% of the buildings. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2112.88s)]
*  Okay, here's another part of the story that's just a side part where they're like, by the [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2116.56s)]
*  way, they've hired American private contractors to literally destroy every home in Gaza. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2121.64s)]
*  And they get paid $1,500 per home that they destroy. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2127.46s)]
*  Wait, it always gets worse. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2131.26s)]
*  They're given carte blanche. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2133.7400000000002s)]
*  So if they see anyone near a home, including someone who owns the home, they murder them. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2135.3s)]
*  They have a right to kill any civilian around a home that they wanna demolish. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2140.54s)]
*  And since they're getting $1,500 per home that they're demolishing, they wanna hurry. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2146.82s)]
*  So they were like, okay, go, smash that one, smash that one. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2152.06s)]
*  Wait, are you looking for a mosque? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2154.5s)]
*  No. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2156.02s)]
*  They're gonna demolish all the homes. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2157.02s)]
*  And if anyone's near the homes, they murder them. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2158.02s)]
*  These are 100% terrorists. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2160.66s)]
*  Okay, and then US evangelicals are part of this scheme. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2163.06s)]
*  Think about how twisted you have to get Christianity. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2167.9s)]
*  That you go near the birthplace of Jesus, not to feed the hungry, but to murder the [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2170.66s)]
*  hungry. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2177.34s)]
*  No, stop calling yourselves Christians. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2178.34s)]
*  You're not Christians at all. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2181.6s)]
*  Tom Massey's right. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2182.94s)]
*  Real Christians don't want genocide, are not in favor of the slaughter of 17,000 children, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2184.86s)]
*  or don't agree with the terrorism of Israel. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2192.94s)]
*  And then every step of the way, just when you think it can't get worse, it does. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2198.5s)]
*  Israel has a version of the game Red Light Green Light that you've seen in squid games, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2204.46s)]
*  a lot of you. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2208.58s)]
*  They're saying basically, that's what they're playing with the people who are trying to [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2211.14s)]
*  get food. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2215.7s)]
*  And so I saw last night, Gaza Journalists Under Fire by Brave New Films. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2217.24s)]
*  You should watch that movie, bravenewfilms.org. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2221.7799999999997s)]
*  We'll put the link down below. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2224.46s)]
*  Make sure you watch that movie. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2226.18s)]
*  It is so powerful. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2227.2999999999997s)]
*  Israel is clearly murdering journalists on purpose. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2229.3799999999997s)]
*  They're clearly murdering civilians on purpose. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2232.18s)]
*  And so in this case, what they're reporting, Haaretz is reporting, an Israeli paper. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2235.18s)]
*  They're saying, these people are desperate. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2242.06s)]
*  They're trying to get food for their kids. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2244.1s)]
*  And that was in the movie, one of the guys who'd been shot trying to get food. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2247.74s)]
*  He's like, either my kids are going to starve, or I'm going to risk getting shot while trying [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2251.38s)]
*  to get food. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2256.02s)]
*  So they have them stop and go, stop and go. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2257.42s)]
*  And maybe they're amused at murdering them. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2260.54s)]
*  When up, it was red light and you still went, so I murdered you. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2262.74s)]
*  This is the current state of Israel, deeply, deeply terrorist state. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2268.02s)]
*  And we give money to these terrorists. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2273.42s)]
*  Those bullets are paid for by American taxpayers. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2275.98s)]
*  You know that sometimes at these food centers, they throw hand grenades. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2278.64s)]
*  They throw hand grenades at civilians coming to get food. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2282.14s)]
*  This is German level now. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2286.3s)]
*  And I don't care at all if you're offended. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2288.82s)]
*  If you're more offended by me calling the Israelis terrorists and Germans, then you [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2291.12s)]
*  are at the civilians that they're murdering. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2296.86s)]
*  Something wrong with your moral compass. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2300.1400000000003s)]
*  If you're like, 70,000 dead kids, who cares? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2301.7000000000003s)]
*  He offended me with a word. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2305.54s)]
*  He's not allowed to criticize us like that. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2308.5s)]
*  Okay, then you're a terrible person. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2310.42s)]
*  You should be spending all of your time trying to end this massacre. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2312.42s)]
*  Nina. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2315.98s)]
*  I mean, Cenk, you said it all. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2316.98s)]
*  I mean, this is sick by any stretch of the, it's sick. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2319.9s)]
*  The Biden administration is complicit as hell. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2324.7s)]
*  They got blood on their hands. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2327.2599999999998s)]
*  President Biden should have done something about this when he was in office because we [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2329.3799999999997s)]
*  knew what was gonna happen when President Donald J. Trump got in office. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2333.3399999999997s)]
*  All he's doing is continuing what the Democrats set up. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2336.74s)]
*  So it's not just President Biden. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2340.3399999999997s)]
*  It is that entire Congress is complicit in this genocide. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2342.16s)]
*  But by the grace of God, there go I. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2348.54s)]
*  And as a woman who was raised up in the Christian church, the Black Liberation Theology, what [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2350.58s)]
*  would Jesus do? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2356.98s)]
*  He wouldn't do any of this. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2357.98s)]
*  He would be with the people. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2359.98s)]
*  So you shoot them outright, then you starve them to death, and then you shoot them when [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2361.86s)]
*  they try to get food. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2365.34s)]
*  I mean, this is sick as hell. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2366.34s)]
*  And everybody should be thoroughly disgusted by this. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2369.38s)]
*  And Jink and John, something that the United Nations Secretary General just put out about [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2376.56s)]
*  six hours ago. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2380.72s)]
*  He said diplomacy and human dignity for all must prevail. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2382.12s)]
*  What is wrong with that? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2385.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm just trying to understand why people can't understand that. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2386.88s)]
*  He said as people in Gaza face injury and death, this is what he stresses. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2389.86s)]
*  We cannot, quoting him, we cannot allow the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza to be pushed [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2395.2599999999998s)]
*  into the shadows. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2401.0s)]
*  Amen to that. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2402.7999999999997s)]
*  This country is complicit. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2405.32s)]
*  We have blood on our hands because it is our weapons, our money that's aiding and abetting [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2407.32s)]
*  a freaking genocide. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2413.6000000000004s)]
*  And I know we talk about how many children that are killed because that is devastating [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2416.2200000000003s)]
*  and we're hoping that when people hear the word children are being killed, that they'll [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2420.04s)]
*  have a little more compassion and mercy. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2424.52s)]
*  But that doesn't seem to work because it's Palestinians. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2426.6000000000004s)]
*  So as far as I'm concerned, Jink and John, all of the innocent civilians that are being [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2429.84s)]
*  killed, whether they're children, men, women, family and friends, all of the people in that [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2435.76s)]
*  region are suffering. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2441.88s)]
*  Either they're being right shot straight up or they're being starved to death. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2442.88s)]
*  And let's think about the water, not getting enough water, the types of diseases that are [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2448.5600000000004s)]
*  bubbling up because of all those buildings that have been destroyed. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2452.96s)]
*  The environmental damage that will take decades upon decades to remediate. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2456.88s)]
*  This is a sickness. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2463.1200000000003s)]
*  We are violating American law. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2464.4s)]
*  We're violating the 620i that is very clear that when a president of the United States, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2466.84s)]
*  the Foreign Assistance Act, that is very clear that when the president of the United States [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2474.0s)]
*  of America has been informed that a country that we are giving weapons to is not allowing [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2477.98s)]
*  aid to come into the place for the civilians. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2483.92s)]
*  That president is supposed to stop this. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2487.7200000000003s)]
*  So damn it, that goes for Biden who failed and definitely President Donald J Trump is [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2489.76s)]
*  failing now. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2494.8s)]
*  He ran and said he was gonna do this thing differently, not just in Gaza. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2495.8s)]
*  He said he wasn't gonna be a war president. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2499.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2501.7200000000003s)]
*  It's sick. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2502.7200000000003s)]
*  This is sick. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2503.7200000000003s)]
*  This is sick. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2505.04s)]
*  And now he's asking for a Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2507.04s)]
*  If only there were a terrible conflict that you could do literally anything to help stop. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2509.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2514.92s)]
*  And doesn't a war require equal sides to have equal power? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2515.92s)]
*  This is a war on Gaza. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2519.7200000000003s)]
*  Cuz they don't have equal forces. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2521.32s)]
*  They don't have European nations on their side that will weapon them up. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2523.6400000000003s)]
*  This is a war on the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2528.98s)]
*  It is not an equal war. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2533.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not a war. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2534.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a war on. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2535.2400000000002s)]
*  100%. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2536.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, we're getting on the hour. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2537.2400000000002s)]
*  So I think we do have to take our break. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2538.64s)]
*  But when we come back, we're gonna get to some of the continued fallout, people losing [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2539.92s)]
*  their minds over Zoran Mamdani's win in New York. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2543.64s)]
*  All right, so you guys saw a new design we've got on up on shoptyt.com there. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2568.64s)]
*  That's the Rebel Alliance slash gladiator design for our logo. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2586.16s)]
*  There it is. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2591.64s)]
*  I kind of love that. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2592.64s)]
*  Don't you like that, John? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2593.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's sick. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2594.64s)]
*  I was actually just saying that during the break. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2595.64s)]
*  I hadn't noticed that one. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2596.64s)]
*  So shoptyt.com, we also have our best selling, you're a vile individual. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2598.0s)]
*  That's Anna, which she called someone defending Israel's genocide on Piers Morgan show. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2602.08s)]
*  You guys asked for it and there it is, shoptyt.com. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2610.04s)]
*  Ring the bell if you can. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2615.72s)]
*  If you're watching on YouTube, it makes a big difference for us and it costs you absolutely [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2617.1s)]
*  nothing. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2621.0s)]
*  So we appreciate it. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2622.0s)]
*  On the Supreme Court decision on tyt.com, put that away says, this is Mitch McConnell [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2623.72s)]
*  win. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2627.9599999999996s)]
*  His decades long mission to pack all levels of courts with conservatives is paying off [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2628.9599999999996s)]
*  for them and will continue to for decades to come. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2632.3599999999997s)]
*  That is true. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2636.04s)]
*  Mitch McConnell was really good at his job. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2637.04s)]
*  His job was being Emperor Palpatine for a while. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2638.9199999999996s)]
*  But the Democrats are terrible at their job, which is supposed to be defend us, the Constitution, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2643.0s)]
*  the country, their own voters. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2648.3199999999997s)]
*  But they never ever do that. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2650.08s)]
*  So that's why Mitch McConnell won easily against the losers in Democratic leadership. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2651.52s)]
*  SM said, I just explained the same thing to my colleagues. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2655.88s)]
*  I mean, our ICE agent is gonna be stationed in the delivery room? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2658.72s)]
*  Wait for it. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2663.24s)]
*  How else do you know? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2664.28s)]
*  If you don't have birthright citizenship, how do you know if the baby born in America [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2666.88s)]
*  is an American citizen? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2670.56s)]
*  You have to investigate their entire lineage. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2671.88s)]
*  So dumb, it's unbelievably dumb. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2675.28s)]
*  Progressive at 60 says, my husband is mowing our yard wearing his new vote hat. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2677.64s)]
*  I purchased for him from TYT. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2681.68s)]
*  He loves it and I love it on him. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2683.4s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2685.48s)]
*  And what I loved is that there were people who were wearing Imran Sheikh's shirt, the [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2686.48s)]
*  ceasefire shirt. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2690.64s)]
*  Part of the proceeds of that also goes to Palestinian children defense. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2691.64s)]
*  I always forget the exact name, but it's fun to help Palestinian children. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2696.12s)]
*  Sorry, guys. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2699.92s)]
*  So anyway, Imran was watching a movie while people were wearing his shirt in the room. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2701.56s)]
*  So that was kind of cool. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2705.96s)]
*  The Sorcerer wrote, I'm the second generation of my family to be born in the USA. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2707.6s)]
*  My grandparents came through Ellis with only my birth certificate. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2710.76s)]
*  I, a white American, cannot prove my citizenship by Trump's rules. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2714.28s)]
*  If it stays, it's the biggest mess that the country will ever see. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2721.0s)]
*  But that's why they can't allow it to stay. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2724.64s)]
*  Yeah, anyway, we'll see. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2727.48s)]
*  Who knows, maybe let me get a miss of it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2729.6s)]
*  Serbers, Dragon Rides and watching that movie was incredibly moving. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2730.92s)]
*  It was such an honor meeting Robert Greenwald and seeing TYT Family, truly one of the best [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2734.3599999999997s)]
*  films I've seen in my lifetime and must be viewed by as many people as possible. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2738.52s)]
*  So bravenewfilms.org as the movie, you go there, you get a free screening. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2743.3999999999996s)]
*  You can watch it by yourself, you can invite others to watch it. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2750.12s)]
*  Bravenewfilms.org was incredible. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2753.04s)]
*  And I think there's some chance that Robert Greenwald is an actual angel. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2755.4199999999996s)]
*  And he said during the Q&A we had afterwards, he's like, as a Jew from New York, I can't [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2761.92s)]
*  let this stand. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2767.04s)]
*  I was brought up to fight against a genocide like this. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2768.6800000000003s)]
*  And so I love him for it. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2773.32s)]
*  And there's so many wonderful Jewish folks watching the movie as well. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2774.6400000000003s)]
*  And it was super moving. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2781.36s)]
*  They said, Jay, keep going. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2782.6s)]
*  You gotta keep trying to stop it. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2785.88s)]

*  When you say it's a threat to American women, what— [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2918.48s)]
*  Oh, that's a Muslim takeover or possibly Sharia law. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2922.32s)]
*  That is a great threat to every single American woman. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2927.04s)]
*  Of course, voters have the right to elect that, and I'll maintain my right to say that [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2929.76s)]
*  I think Sharia law and women being forced to wear burqas is the greatest threat to our [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2933.76s)]
*  freedoms as American women. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2938.96s)]
*  Right, but are you opposed to Muslims holding elected office? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2940.48s)]
*  I am 100% opposed to Sharia law in America. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2943.76s)]
*  100% unapologetically opposed to Sharia law in America. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2947.44s)]
*  I'll just be thinking about that the next time she asks me to be nice to her. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2953.12s)]
*  So he is Muslim, and so she's not gonna say it, but he cannot hold elected office, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2955.84s)]
*  and she's hardly alone in believing that. And this is just another example of the nonstop [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2963.2000000000003s)]
*  24-7 identity politics from the right. They're not gonna even attempt to argue against Mamdani [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2967.76s)]
*  on the policies. His identity is the argument. He is that way, so that's it. I don't have to [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2973.28s)]
*  explain myself. And in America, we don't have Sharia law. Muslim dictates or whatever, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2980.1600000000003s)]
*  do not determine the rights that you have. This is America. Evangelical Christianity dictates [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2987.2000000000003s)]
*  what rights you have in America, unfortunately. By the way, it was earlier today that the Supreme [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2992.8s)]
*  Court came out with multiple rulings that effectively just enshrined Christian nationalist [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=2996.6400000000003s)]
*  policies into law. On the topic of parents' rights, you had three dissenting justices [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3003.36s)]
*  saying that insurance shouldn't have to pay for HIV medication, an explicit stop to the religious [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3008.6400000000003s)]
*  right. But anyway, so she's not gonna apologize for it. She's not gonna explain it. She probably [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3015.84s)]
*  doesn't even understand the point that she's making, but that's her. And that is just a tweet, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3019.92s)]
*  after all. That's as far as it goes for her. For others, like Representative Andy Ogles, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3023.76s)]
*  it's not just a tweet. So he put out a tweet, but he wants action. He said, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3030.48s)]
*  Zoran Little Muhammad Mamdani is an anti-Semitic socialist communist who will destroy the great [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3034.4s)]
*  city of New York. He needs to be deported, which is why I'm calling for him to be subject to [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3040.8s)]
*  denaturalization proceedings. So yesterday, it was like the young Republicans Club saying, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3045.6800000000003s)]
*  we can't hope to beat this guy. So please save us, get him out of this country instantly. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3051.52s)]
*  And as I tweeted, the debate me bros have become the deport him bros. That's how much faith they [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3056.48s)]
*  have in their rhetoric and policies. But anyway, that's a representative. I don't know, maybe you [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3061.84s)]
*  know, Cenk, what the little Muhammad means. I don't even know what that's a reference to. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3067.36s)]
*  I think it's just racism. But he's an anti-Semitic socialist and a communist. And for one or multiple [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3072.0s)]
*  those reasons, the fact that he's a citizen is irrelevant. He should be shipped out of the [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3078.0s)]
*  country. Now, if you're, for instance, like Nick Fuentes or Kanye West and you're wildly anti-Semitic, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3082.88s)]
*  you get to have dinner with the president. If you are Muslim and we want to make that equate [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3089.36s)]
*  to anti-Semitism, then you don't get to hold an elected office in America. Again, all this is just [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3094.56s)]
*  based off of your identity combined with your skin color. But that's two representatives losing [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3098.8s)]
*  their minds, triggered beyond rational thought over the fact that this young charismatic man [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3105.44s)]
*  did better than expected in that race. And so I don't know by Monday, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3111.36s)]
*  what is Holman gonna be doing? What is Stephen Miller gonna be doing? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3116.1600000000003s)]
*  Pam Bondi is a total tool in this fascist regime. Is it impossible that she'll look into finding [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3119.44s)]
*  some sort of excuse? Do you think that they're not pouring through his paperwork? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3125.76s)]
*  He's been a citizen for years, but is it possible that maybe something was punctuated wrong in one [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3129.1200000000003s)]
*  of his pieces of paperwork a decade ago? Maybe he was late on something, that they wouldn't find [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3134.96s)]
*  some excuse to deport this guy based entirely off of his identity. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3139.12s)]
*  Yeah, so I've been telling you guys, don't just blanket call all Trump voters fascist or racist, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3142.4s)]
*  right? So that's about the voters, not the politicians. And as I've clarified a thousand [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3150.0s)]
*  times, you fight the politicians, you fight the powerful, you fight the donors, you fight the [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3155.6s)]
*  mainstream media, you look up, right? And secondly, when they are actually literally being racist or [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3160.0s)]
*  bigots, yeah, you get to say that. So here's a contrast, super random, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3167.6s)]
*  super chat just came in, not having to do with this, but I'm gonna read it to you [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3173.12s)]
*  because of the point I'm making. Jason Travis said, I'm a populist conservative, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3177.12s)]
*  so agree with you on a lot of economic issues, Medicaid for all, for example. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3182.48s)]
*  I can say I would rather vote AOC for president than a corporate Republican, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3187.12s)]
*  and that's why I'm a TYT member. So that's awesome, and we appreciate you, Jason. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3192.08s)]
*  So that's why I say, don't make blanket assumptions about the voters, they're a giant range. But when [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3196.64s)]
*  it comes to the politicians, Andy Ogles is a dirtbag, and he's obviously a racist bigot, right? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3202.56s)]
*  And I don't really care if he gets offended at all, because he obviously doesn't care if he [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3209.6s)]
*  offends Muslims, right? What is little Mohammed? It's not a reference to anything, so he's Muslim, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3214.4s)]
*  let's all hate him. That's because Andy Ogles is a moron of epic proportions, okay? And what the [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3220.7999999999997s)]
*  hell is that Marjorie Taylor Greene Burka thing? And her explanation makes it even worse. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3226.08s)]
*  A Sharia law is the greatest threat to our freedom, really? This is what I remember when [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3231.6s)]
*  Oklahoma passed a law saying that there shall be no Sharia law in Oklahoma. Really, why? Was Tulsa [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3236.24s)]
*  in danger of being taken over by the caliphate? Okay, no, this is just the drama of hatred towards [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3242.72s)]
*  Muslims. Nobody's taking over New York with Sharia law. There's giant Muslim countries like Turkey [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3248.64s)]
*  that don't have Sharia law. You think one guy is gonna come into New York like that is it, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3253.68s)]
*  even though I didn't say anything about it. And I'm not fundamentalist, and I'm not radical, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3258.56s)]
*  and I'm not any of these things. I'm gonna just turn New York into Sharia law. And by the way, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3263.7599999999998s)]
*  the state legislature is gonna go along with it, and so is the city council. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3268.64s)]
*  They're not even trying to make sense, okay? So what they're saying is, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3272.0s)]
*  he's mad. So if you don't like that, don't say stupid crap like that, because you sound [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3275.76s)]
*  like a total utter moron. It's not just that, okay, look, I can get mad about the racism and [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3284.0800000000004s)]
*  bigotry, etc. As a person who grew up Muslim in America, I'm a little used to it, right? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3289.76s)]
*  And that's why, honestly, I get amused by Israeli supporters who are like, I'm offended. You said [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3296.4s)]
*  that word slightly wrong. My God, I'm so offended, right? Try being Muslim for a second, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3301.76s)]
*  and see how that turns out for you. But put that aside, I just wanna focus on how stupid they are. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3307.0400000000004s)]
*  Because they think all 2 billion Muslims are the same, and that we're all violent terrorists. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3312.2400000000002s)]
*  And that if Mamdani takes over New York, as takes over New York as mayor, a lot of them, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3318.5600000000004s)]
*  as we're gonna get to here, think that it's gonna be 9-11. Right away, like Laura Loomer said it, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3325.6000000000004s)]
*  others have said it. He's gonna come in and go, okay, that's it, I'm now the mayor. This is the [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3331.76s)]
*  button to blow up New York, right? There is no button to blow up New York. And he's coming to [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3335.84s)]
*  serve New York. But because he's Muslim, they say all these terrible things without any backup, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3341.36s)]
*  any backup to it at all, cuz they're terrible human beings. But hold, I'm gonna argue that it [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3346.7200000000003s)]
*  gets worse, okay? Cuz I think what Kirsten Gillibrand is doing is not as clearly racist as this. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3353.2000000000003s)]
*  But I think that it is more subversive, more disgusting, and more likely to be effective. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3360.4s)]
*  In fact, we're asking the hardest question we've ever asked at tyt.com. Who will do the [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3365.84s)]
*  most damage to Zoran Mamdani? A, MAGA, MAGA guys who are like, yeah, he's Muslim, he's gonna blow [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3371.04s)]
*  up New York, okay? Yeah, that was a little bit of their voters. Hey, listen, if you don't think [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3377.04s)]
*  that in your MAGA, you're innocent. If you do think that, you are a moron. Okay, B, Establishment [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3384.4s)]
*  Democrats, that's the Gillibrand part we're gonna get to. C, donors like APAC, Bill Ackman. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3390.0s)]
*  You can see how this is hard cuz they're all gonna come from. And D, mainstream media. I don't know [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3395.84s)]
*  how to answer that. I think MAGA, because they're like the MAGA politicians, because they're so [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3400.96s)]
*  stupid and obviously racist, will do the least damage. But the other three are gonna combine [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3407.04s)]
*  for massive damage against Mamdani. So John's gonna tell you about the others in a second, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3413.04s)]
*  but what do you think so far, Nina? Yeah, absolutely, Gene, you made that impossible. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3418.24s)]
*  I'm saying B all the way. It will definitely be the neolives. I'm old enough to remember when [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3423.68s)]
*  India Walton in Buffalo, New York won the Democratic primary. And the neoliberals found a way [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3430.56s)]
*  to snatch that from her by having the mayor, that then incumbent, he was able to run on another line [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3437.52s)]
*  and capture the general election. So we know Cuomo's out there now, basically saying, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3444.24s)]
*  he doesn't know what he's gonna do, but he's gonna keep that line. In terms of Marjorie [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3451.2799999999997s)]
*  Telegreen, Lord Jesus, two words, seek help. Really, Sharia law is the biggest threat to [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3455.2799999999997s)]
*  women in America, but not the legislation that has been enacted all over this country in various [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3461.68s)]
*  states that takes away a woman's ability to control her own body. That's not the biggest threat. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3468.4799999999996s)]
*  But Sharia law is, how about the fact that most women are not making dollar to dollar, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3473.92s)]
*  dollar for dollar as their male counterparts? That's not a big threat, but non-existent Sharia [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3479.2000000000003s)]
*  law in America is. Or how about the federal minimum wage not increasing, or the sub-minimum wage that [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3486.16s)]
*  we gotta do? Oh no, none of those things. How about the fact that we don't have universal health care? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3492.48s)]
*  Those things are real threats to women in America. So if the Congresswoman was really serious [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3497.52s)]
*  about fighting those threats, she would come on and join the folks on the side that wanna [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3504.8s)]
*  change material conditions. And in terms of women being able to control what they wear, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3510.0s)]
*  I can remember even in some of my church experiences, being limited growing up on what [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3514.8s)]
*  I could wear. In certain segments of churches, women wearing pants is not acceptable. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3520.96s)]
*  And since I was a child being indoctrinated in this way, I didn't have many choices until [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3526.88s)]
*  I became grown. So for her to sit up here and say that only in some Muslim portions of Sharia, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3532.08s)]
*  Shiite, whatever, the different segments of it is the only thing that oppresses women. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3540.2400000000002s)]
*  The woman is lying, her teeth, she's lying through her teeth. And I would have more respect for her [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3545.52s)]
*  if she just come on out and say that Moondani is a Muslim and that is why she is opposed [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3551.04s)]
*  to him versus playing these games, tricks are for kids, Congresswoman. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3556.16s)]
*  Yeah, one quick thing, if you think that all Muslims are violent fundamentalists, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3561.04s)]
*  it's like somebody coming in going, Christians, they're so stupid. They handle the snakes and [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3566.72s)]
*  speak in tongues like morons. No, no, that's just Pentecostal fundamentalists, okay? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3571.3599999999997s)]
*  To say that all Christians like that would be mental, right? But Muslim terrorists are even [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3578.24s)]
*  smaller than fundamentalist Pentecostals. Because they're terrorists, there's only a couple of [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3585.28s)]
*  hundred of them in the whole planet. There's two billion Muslims, right? It's a microscopic [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3591.36s)]
*  percentage, right? But no, when it's a Muslim, you can smear all of them. You can smear a quarter [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3596.6400000000003s)]
*  of the planet and it's totally fine. It's not fine if you do it to Christians, it's not fine [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3602.5600000000004s)]
*  or Jews or Muslims. Yeah, and so- [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3606.7200000000003s)]
*  Especially for a party that decries identity politics, they sure play a lot of it, doesn't [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3610.72s)]
*  they? Exactly, that's a great point, Nina. Because this is how, look, I say a lot of times, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3615.9199999999996s)]
*  don't fall into the trap of going along with things that are unpopular in identity politics. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3620.9599999999996s)]
*  But this is the Republicans starting identity politics and they started all the time. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3625.8399999999997s)]
*  There's another identity politics thing they started, it's called the Southern Strategy. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3630.16s)]
*  Okay, you should check that out of my book, Justice is Coming. So Republicans that complain [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3634.16s)]
*  about identity politics, so when your own politicians do it, why don't you tell them [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3639.36s)]
*  to shut their mouth? All right, go ahead. Yeah, and in particular, when the Democrats know [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3643.6s)]
*  that the Republicans elected media otherwise are doing all of this, the fact that so many of them [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3649.2000000000003s)]
*  would either participate, as we're gonna show you, or for the most part, a lot of them just stand [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3655.1200000000003s)]
*  back, don't defend him, don't rally around your popular future star potentially. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3659.04s)]
*  Instead, just allow them to be attacked or in some cases actually participate in it. And so [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3665.84s)]
*  here is Kirsten Gillibrand. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3670.7200000000003s)]
*  But I do also wanna be clear that he said he does not support violent interfaida, is that fair? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3674.0800000000004s)]
*  So Brian, I didn't hear your exchange with him. But if I was speaking to him directly, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3681.2000000000003s)]
*  I would simply say that is not how the words are received. And it doesn't matter what meaning you [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3688.5600000000004s)]
*  have in your brain, it is not how the word is received. And when you use a word like interfaida [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3694.64s)]
*  to many Jewish Americans and Jewish New Yorkers, that means you are permissive for violence against [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3700.8799999999997s)]
*  Jews. So I appreciate that he told you he didn't mean that, and that's great. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3708.08s)]
*  That's a great place to start. And I think we also clarify, or he was clarifying that he never said [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3712.16s)]
*  globalize the interfaida. He was asked in an interview if he would denounce the phrase [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3718.16s)]
*  globalize the interfaida. And then that led to this kind of conversation that you were [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3723.44s)]
*  just referring to. But that he was never out there saying globalize the interfaida. He was [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3729.76s)]
*  asked about other people who used it. So just to be precise about what happened there, yes? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3736.4s)]
*  Well, as a leader of a city as diverse as New York City with 8 million people, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3743.84s)]
*  as the largest Jewish population in the country, he should denounce it. And that's it, period. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3748.96s)]
*  So pretty naturally it goes from denouncing him because you think mistakenly that he said it, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3756.96s)]
*  then you're reminded that he did not in fact say it. And you're still just denouncing him [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3764.6400000000003s)]
*  exactly as much, like it doesn't matter. And again, yeah, you're a leader of that state. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3768.6400000000003s)]
*  And the Democratic elector of that state also just chose him. He could potentially be [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3772.7200000000003s)]
*  a leader too. Maybe speak with him. Maybe especially when you see the rabid, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3776.96s)]
*  vile Islamophobia racing towards him. We're not just talking about catchphrases. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3783.04s)]
*  Elected representatives are calling for him to be denaturalized and deported. Maybe end up [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3788.0s)]
*  in CICOT or something like that. The fact that Gillibrand would so [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3793.44s)]
*  readily jump on board with that is depressing. Now coming out of the interview, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3797.44s)]
*  spokesman for Gillibrand said that she had misspoken when initially implying that he had [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3802.48s)]
*  said it. Again, she didn't misspeak, she was wrong. And even when corrected held basically [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3807.6s)]
*  the same position. But in any event, we've been debating who it is is gonna do more damage. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3814.64s)]
*  Cenk, what do you make of that and the willingness to do this character assassination? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3820.16s)]
*  So that's just a sophisticated way of saying, hey, little Mohammed, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3824.48s)]
*  my donors say you shouldn't be in this race. Hey, donors, send me money. I love Israel. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3829.04s)]
*  And I'm gonna smear any Muslim that comes across here. So Gillibrand's disgusting, okay? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3833.84s)]
*  So look, I'm gonna go off more on Gillibrand and tell you how dangerous she is and how [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3839.6s)]
*  counterproductive she's been to the entire Democratic Party. But first, he didn't even say [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3844.64s)]
*  a word, but they're doing a character assassination based on him defending someone else saying a word. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3850.64s)]
*  Gee, I wonder if I predicted that there would be character assassinations [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3859.2s)]
*  from the left and the right. Let's just watch from yesterday's show. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3862.72s)]
*  What I want you to know and look for going forward from this day to the day of the general election [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3867.7599999999998s)]
*  in New York is watch what the mainstream media does. Cuz they're the actual hatchet men. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3874.24s)]
*  Remember the Ackman money goes into buying ads in mainstream media. And then mainstream media [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3880.32s)]
*  coincidentally supports their candidate 100%. And then digs and digs and digs and tries to [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3887.6800000000003s)]
*  find something wrong with Mamdani. And then comes out and goes, we have this and this and this. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3894.08s)]
*  And a Republican congressman today already added. He found a rap lyric is something Mamdani sang [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3900.7200000000003s)]
*  once and he's like, he's supporting the wrong people in a rap line or whatever. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3906.64s)]
*  So you're gonna see 200 stories like that. And here we go, we're on the board already. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3912.56s)]
*  Okay, with several of them. And the way that it works is it's an incestuous cycle. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3918.48s)]
*  Someone plants a story in the media. Did you know he didn't denounce [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3922.8799999999997s)]
*  the phrase globalize the Intifada? And then establishment Democrat like Jilla Brand picks [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3926.64s)]
*  it up and goes, my God, he's saying illegal words. My donors are super upset. I mean, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3931.2799999999997s)]
*  the voters of New York are super upset. They're super upset that anyone's criticizing our [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3936.56s)]
*  beloved Israel. I mean, this goddamn Muslim. I mean, I'm worried about the words he's using. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3941.2s)]
*  Well, he didn't use them. But words he's defending that he might use, but he doesn't use, etc. I [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3947.04s)]
*  told you, I told you, they're gonna pull one hatchet after another. By the way, if they're [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3952.64s)]
*  using words he didn't even use to smear him, like I said, there's gonna be 200 of these. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3956.96s)]
*  And that also means they don't have much. If they're having to go to rap lyrics from when he was a [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3962.64s)]
*  kid about some randos and they're going to words he didn't even say, that means they got bupkis. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3967.76s)]
*  They have the equivalent of Marjorie Taylor Greene and the Burka and Andy Ogles and little Mohamed. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3974.88s)]
*  So but the reason why I think Jilla Brand does more damage is because of two things. One, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3980.2400000000002s)]
*  it's more nefarious. So when the idiot Republican politician goes in and goes, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3985.2s)]
*  he's Muslim, I don't like Muslims, right? You're like, hey, everybody on the planet knows what a [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3990.3199999999997s)]
*  moron, easy to dismiss, right? Jilla Brand comes in with, he's offending people. He's the one that's [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=3995.9199999999996s)]
*  actually causing harm. We have to stop him. He's causing harm with his Muslimness. And hit the [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4002.16s)]
*  fact that he doesn't love Israel and say that we should send all our money to Israel. We have to [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4007.2799999999997s)]
*  stop that stupid Muslim. I mean, I'm way more sophisticated. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4011.84s)]
*  My voters are offended. Hey, I'm offended a lot of words from the river to the sea, right? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4015.76s)]
*  Terrible, I denounce that. I said, don't do that and the chances counterproductive. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4020.32s)]
*  It's not gonna help us. And then Benjamin Netanyahu came out and said for the whole world [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4023.76s)]
*  that Israel is going to do from the river to the sea. He literally said it and then he literally [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4029.5200000000004s)]
*  is doing it. And is that a problem? Jilla Brand has never called that out, never. No, Jilla Brand [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4036.08s)]
*  loves it when Israel does the genocide, cuz tons and tons of her donors are AIPAC and other Israeli [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4042.7999999999997s)]
*  lobbyists. So the Republicans stab you from the front, the Democrats stab you from the back. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4050.88s)]
*  And Jilla Brand's famous for that. She's the one who stabbed Al Franken in the back and said, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4058.56s)]
*  I'm so disgusted by his sexual harassment. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4064.24s)]
*  Cuz she thought that she was gonna run for president, she did for about a second. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4067.9199999999996s)]
*  And Franken was gonna run for president at the time. So she wanted to eliminate one of [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4071.7599999999998s)]
*  her opponents within the Democratic Party. And now she sees Zoran Mamdani and he's [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4075.9199999999996s)]
*  unacceptably not polishing the boots of Netanyahu. And so she's like, donors, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4081.3599999999997s)]
*  remember how much I tried to put a hatchet in Mamdani's back. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4089.44s)]
*  Cuz he's a stupid Muslim. You're just like Marjorie Taylor Greene. In fact, you're worse than her. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4094.08s)]
*  Okay, that's how I feel about it, Nina. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4099.2s)]
*  Amen. I mean, amen. She is a coward of epic proportions. And yes, Democrats like her are [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4100.96s)]
*  gonna do more damage than MAGA. And they're gonna combine with the media and with the money class. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4109.6s)]
*  So they all go together, but she is an absolute coward. So I'm just saying, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4116.0s)]
*  Mamdani, what you're saying, Cenk, you summed it up. I'm just saying, she's a coward. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4122.32s)]
*  Yes, I agree. And mainstream media will love it. They'll say tut, tut, tut to Andy Ogles and [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4125.76s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene. And then they will repeat the Gillibrand kind of smears 2,000 times. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4134.0s)]
*  Watch, you'll see it. You'll see it going forward. Mainstream media will take that [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4139.92s)]
*  super legitimately. And they'll talk endlessly about a word he didn't even say, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4144.24s)]
*  right? And yes, intifada can mean both things and oftentimes is referred to as a global fight back [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4148.8s)]
*  against the occupation through politics, diplomacy, words. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4157.92s)]
*  And some people mean it as violence and others do not mean it as violence. Also, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4162.48s)]
*  there are words like greater Israel, arets Israel, which mean and Judeo-Semaria. That means [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4167.84s)]
*  that West Bank and Gaza Strip are Jewish land that Israel will swallow whole. They have the maps up [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4174.96s)]
*  in their cabinet and their Knesset, etc. And they plan to ethnically cleanse all the Palestinians [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4181.52s)]
*  and take that land. And they're actually doing it, but that has never bothered Gillibrand as long as [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4187.28s)]
*  it checks clear. She's totally and completely bought by the Israeli lobby. And yes, I said that. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4193.92s)]
*  And let me see you call out arets Israel. Let me see you call out the genocidal, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4200.96s)]
*  terroristic state of Israel. We just did a story earlier today, arets reporting they're murdering [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4206.32s)]
*  people getting food on purpose, civilians, 17,000 dead kids. But Gillibrand doesn't care. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4213.12s)]
*  She cares about words, words. A stadium full of murdered children, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4221.4400000000005s)]
*  a pack of the check list, the stupid Muslims, who cares about them, right? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4227.68s)]
*  A word offended one of my donors, a word he didn't even say. So that's kind of scum, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4232.96s)]
*  Kirsten Gillibrand is, who likes to destroy people. And then all of mainstream media will [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4238.64s)]
*  help her try to destroy Mom Donnie and credit to Brian Lehrer for actually sitting out for the truth [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4245.6s)]
*  there. Thank you, brother, for doing your job and saying what was true instead of going along with [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4250.0s)]
*  this horrifically racist senator from New York, okay? No, Jewish Americans are not the only people [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4254.64s)]
*  who get to say that they are offended. I'm offended, I'm offended. Does that count? No, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4263.12s)]
*  no, if Muslims are offended, cuz you attack all Muslims who don't bow their heads to a foreign [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4268.96s)]
*  government. But our offense doesn't matter, right, Gillibrand? Cuz we didn't donate to you. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4274.08s)]
*  That's how these crooks are, in both in the Republican and Democratic Party, young Turks. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4279.360000000001s)]
*  Our audience has given us everything so we couldn't be more connected. When we first started, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4294.8s)]
*  people would start giving us directions and say, okay, the mics are too large, move them. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4299.52s)]
*  Turn them into lav mics. I mean, they were incredible. And then one guy walked in and [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4305.28s)]
*  gave us a really expensive switcher and said, you guys need this and walked out. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4308.32s)]
*  Okay, it's amazing. They helped us build a studio, they did a $2 million funding campaign for us. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4313.2s)]
*  And so they really are us. We do this show together to the point where some of our hosts [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4320.24s)]
*  are even former listeners. So when we say that the audience is part of TYT, we really mean it. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4326.08s)]
*  Think what the audience also appreciates is if they're, especially if they're members, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4335.44s)]
*  they really get an inside look into who we are, our personal lives, what drives and motivates us. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4340.719999999999s)]
*  It goes beyond just storytelling. I think that what we do is allow our viewers and our listeners [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4347.759999999999s)]
*  into our daily lives. And we give them kind of like this inside look into everything that [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4355.44s)]
*  we're passionate about and why it is that we're doing what we're doing, right? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4360.96s)]
*  The motivation behind what we're doing, I think is important for our audience to know. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4364.88s)]
*  And we're not shy about sharing that with them. And it's different from what people typically see [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4369.6s)]
*  in legacy media outlets, where everything is kind of dry and robotic and there's really no [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4375.12s)]
*  personality or authenticity that comes along with it. Oftentimes when we're doing the show, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4380.64s)]
*  I don't really think of it as me telling them stories. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4384.8s)]
*  I think of it as us having a mutual respect and conversation with one another. And as I said [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4388.400000000001s)]
*  earlier, I mean, not only do I feel that through the work I do at informing our audience, but [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4395.12s)]
*  they inform me oftentimes as well. They'll pitch stories to us. They'll tell us a certain [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4400.08s)]
*  perspective or angle to a story that we might've missed. And I love it. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4406.0s)]
*  Now these are partial videos. If you wanna get all of them, you become a member, go to tyt.com [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4415.04s)]

*  I'm bitsing right now. Behind the scenes. Okay. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4437.04s)]
*  Okay. She doesn't have her face on folks. Oh, that's JR's ass right there. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4441.12s)]
*  Can't take five minutes off, can you? No, I can't, Johnny. Bye. I said it was live stream, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4447.2s)]
*  but I was lying. It's not a live stream. It's just for members. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4452.24s)]
*  Bitsy, this is my cat. You know what his name is? Kiki cat. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4455.76s)]
*  Animals are innocent. The troll room and the insanity is obviously there. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4459.5199999999995s)]
*  Right now, as you can see, I'm directing or tech directing. I'm so happy to be here. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4463.599999999999s)]
*  This is what like a Labor Day beard looks like for Jake. Man, you're a young girl's viewer if [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4467.44s)]
*  you recognize me like this. Thank you. You are the one person in my life that I would love to meet. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4471.839999999999s)]
*  What's going on guys? This is Bitsy or BTS or behind the scenes with Prasam Piker, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4477.679999999999s)]
*  AKA Woke Bae. Oh, hi. I didn't see you there. I have finished my show, The Damaged War, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4483.2s)]
*  and now I get into a really awkward time of the day. When I'm sitting, the control room is right [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4488.639999999999s)]
*  there. So I can see Bart. This is the Pittsburgh office, by the way. I refer to often as the [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4493.44s)]
*  boiler room. You see how it's ripped? Is it super unprofessional to wear that at a business meeting [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4498.08s)]
*  or am I like cool rebel? I just finished doing the power panel and I'm fired up. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4502.879999999999s)]
*  What do you do for TYT? Not a whole lot. If you're frantically tweeting at us that something's [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4508.639999999999s)]
*  broken, thank you because I'm fixing it. And thank you for being a TYT member. Super last thing, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4513.919999999999s)]
*  because there's always gotta be a super last thing. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4518.48s)]
*  Oh, that was disastrous. This has been behind the scenes, behind the scenes. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4521.839999999999s)]
*  Drop it. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4578.4s)]
*  All right, Young Turks, second hour power panel. Jane Huger, Wasney Lombre, Sharon Reed, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4599.599999999999s)]
*  Sharon's on Rebel HQ, Wasney's a senior writer at The Ringer. Make sure you check him out [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4604.16s)]
*  there in his podcast as Was speaks. And Fat Satter, thank you, brother, for gifting five [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4608.16s)]
*  memberships on YouTube. And Dave Gustavo, thank you for hitting the join button. We appreciate it. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4615.04s)]
*  All right, I'm interviewing two right wing podcasters at the top of the hour at eight [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4619.92s)]
*  o'clock Eastern. That's gonna be freely available to everyone. Could be interesting. So [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4625.599999999999s)]
*  a lot to get through. So Sharon, let's do it. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4630.32s)]
*  It's gonna be interesting. Can't wait for that. But in the meantime, Cenk and Was, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4633.28s)]
*  we begin with this one, Free Press. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4638.32s)]
*  One thing America can make, it's a bomb. Ask the Japanese, ask the Germans. I've never heard of [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4640.0s)]
*  an American bomb not working, have you? Everybody says direct hit, years to come back from it. And [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4648.4s)]
*  then there's CNN alone in the corner in last place, spewing enemy propaganda. I don't think [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4654.799999999999s)]
*  they can come back from this. Entertainment host, Fox News' Jesse Waters, furious over CNN's recent [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4660.16s)]
*  reporting that stated the strikes on Iran only set back its nuclear program by a couple of months. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4669.04s)]
*  Clearly, Trump is God, what he says goes. And the United States is the most technologically [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4674.5599999999995s)]
*  advanced country that gets everything right, never manages a mistake. Cenk, we're gonna throw to you [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4680.48s)]
*  in a second. But first, let's get more details, what Jesse Waters had to say about the strike, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4686.8s)]
*  because the level of delulu, I'll say, is insane for this one. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4692.24s)]
*  Oh, Jesse, it almost seems like CNN and the New York Times are using this leaked report, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4698.08s)]
*  whatever it is, to cheer triumphantly that perhaps the Bunker Buster bomber strike [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4703.84s)]
*  wasn't quite as effective as the administration is claiming. What do you make of that? And will [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4710.88s)]
*  the president get credit if he did, in fact, dismantle Iran's nuclear program? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4715.84s)]
*  Of course, if there's one thing America can make, it's a bomb. If this didn't work and it was a dud, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4720.24s)]
*  Netanyahu would have been on the phone with Trump saying, let's do another run. If it didn't work, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4726.88s)]
*  the Iranians wouldn't have had a ceasefire. This was such a precise strike. They put these bombs [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4731.360000000001s)]
*  down the mountain's ventilation shaft. Okay, this didn't have to explode and bore into the mountain. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4739.6s)]
*  They put these things untouched and it slid down the ventilation shaft and exploded in the main hall [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4746.88s)]
*  and then collapsed the roof of the cavern and caused a fire. You could even see the discoloration [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4755.92s)]
*  at the top of the mountain. This wasn't like carpet bombing the North Vietnamese jungles. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4761.84s)]
*  This was as precise a strike as you can get. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4767.12s)]
*  Cenk, I guess I don't understand why this was so important to the administration and the man [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4769.759999999999s)]
*  who leads it, President Trump. I mean, if they set him back a couple of months, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4779.679999999999s)]
*  wouldn't that be a success then get a ceasefire? I just don't understand why [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4783.92s)]
*  Jesse Waters has to carry the water for the president in this way. A strike is a strike [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4788.16s)]
*  and things didn't go well. Do we have to debate the level which they didn't go well? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4793.28s)]
*  Well, so there's a hilarious lie in there that we're gonna show you in a little bit from Jesse [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4798.32s)]
*  Waters. He actually contradicts himself. I love it. But first, to Sharon's point, one of the things [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4803.28s)]
*  I want to discuss here is, look, I think that that was cherry picked intelligence and I'm glad [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4810.96s)]
*  that they're not listening to it. So I agree with the result of what Donald Trump and Jesse Waters [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4816.32s)]
*  want, which is let's not bomb Iran anymore. The bombing worked well enough. Let's get out of there. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4821.12s)]
*  Okay, but why do you have to attack CNN and New York Times and threaten to sue them or get the [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4827.2s)]
*  reporters fired? That's not necessary at all. You just say it's cherry picked intelligence is [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4834.4s)]
*  wrong and you move on. But nope, nope, they always have to take it over the top. They always have to [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4839.44s)]
*  try to get everybody fired and canceled and no one's allowed to criticize the president. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4845.5199999999995s)]
*  No one's allowed to dispute the president. Do we live in a democracy or don't we? Do you believe [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4850.56s)]
*  in freedom of speech or not? New York Times and CNN said, so what? Say something back, right? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4854.64s)]
*  Instead of demanding that no one be allowed to say it. They're hilariously hypocritical on [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4861.200000000001s)]
*  free speech. But let me let you finish the rest of the story then I wanna come back to the lie too. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4868.0s)]
*  Yeah, hypocritical somewhat. Well, dictatorship is what comes to mind, evidence of that. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4872.4800000000005s)]
*  So let's get into it. CNN, the New York Times, according to the Times, the report by the Defense [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4880.4800000000005s)]
*  Intelligence Agency focused largely on the state of the Porto plant, country's deeply buried [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4884.72s)]
*  enrichment facility, which produced the near bomb grade fuel. Multiple officials familiar [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4892.8s)]
*  with the intelligence report that spoke to both the Times and CNN said early findings showed this. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4897.92s)]
*  The strikes had set back Iran's nuclear program by months. Officials said the strikes sealed off [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4905.36s)]
*  entrances to the facility but had not led to a collapse leaving open the possibility that Iran [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4910.24s)]
*  could eventually dig it out. New York Times, CNN's report also stated this, the analysis of the [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4917.04s)]
*  damage to the sites and the impact of the strikes on Iran's nuclear ambitions is ongoing. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4923.36s)]
*  Good changes, more intelligence becomes available but the early findings are at odds with President [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4929.759999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump's repeated claims that the strikes completely and totally obliterated Iran's nuclear [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4934.32s)]
*  enrichment facilities. But ah-ha, Jesse Waters arguing that this reporting is just enemy propaganda [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4941.2s)]
*  trying to discredit Trump. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4948.32s)]
*  The woman is the same reporter who said the laptop was Russia and now she says our bombs don't work. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4951.92s)]
*  You'd think she would have been fired for getting hoodwinked by the deep state a couple years ago, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4959.28s)]
*  but she actually got promoted. She got promoted for being wrong. She got a raise for being wrong. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4965.92s)]
*  Now she's on CNN getting hoodwinked all over again because that's the point. She's not there [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4972.639999999999s)]
*  to be right. She's just there to hurt Donald Trump. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4976.96s)]
*  All right, so as we reported yesterday, Donald Trump went on a Trump social bender, if you will, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4982.16s)]
*  stating fake news. CNN is so disgusting and incompetent. And of course, what does Trump do [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4986.96s)]
*  when hit with critical reporting about him? Well, Cenk talked about it. He threatens to sue. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4993.28s)]
*  This according to the New York Times, in a letter to the Times, a personal lawyer for the President [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=4999.52s)]
*  said the newspaper's article had damaged Mr. Trump's reputation and demanded that the news [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5004.4s)]
*  organization retract and apologize for the piece, which the letter described as false, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5010.16s)]
*  defamatory, and unpatriotic. So maybe you can sue for that. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5015.44s)]
*  CNN also confirmed they received a similar threat. The letter from Trump's lawyer, [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5021.92s)]
*  Alejandro Grito, described the attack on Iran as a, quote, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5027.04s)]
*  historic and resounding military success that unequivocally eliminated Iran's nuclear [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5031.28s)]
*  capabilities and brought peace to the region, echoing the President's own characterizations [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5036.719999999999s)]
*  of the operation. Mr. Grito asserted that the Times article about the preliminary intelligence [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5042.08s)]
*  assessment, quote, undermined the credibility and integrity of President Trump in the eyes [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5047.759999999999s)]
*  of the public and the professional community. But again, the Times noted the preliminary nature [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5052.639999999999s)]
*  of the report. So they're covered there. The Times in response on Thursday rejected Trump's [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5060.32s)]
*  demands, noting that Trump administration officials had subsequently confirmed the existence of the [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5065.679999999999s)]
*  report issued by the Defense Intelligence Agency and its findings. No retraction is needed. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5071.12s)]
*  No apology will be forthcoming. We told the truth to the best of our ability. We will continue to do [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5079.2s)]
*  so. The Times lawyer pushing back. And look, let's hope that they continue to push back [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5086.64s)]
*  Cenk and Woz. But I don't know. It seems that the more of this frivolous nonsense, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5096.240000000001s)]
*  this battling from the administration, legal fictitious renderings go out. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5101.200000000001s)]
*  More and more news organizations could cave. Not necessarily the newspapers, Cenk, but we've seen [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5106.8s)]
*  it with multiple networks caving and giving ridiculous settlements. What do you think happens [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5112.48s)]
*  here? Yeah, unfortunately, as predicted now, other politicians are doing it like Gavin Newsom. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5117.759999999999s)]
*  Want to get back to that too, but I want to let Woz weigh in first. What do you think, Woz? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5123.28s)]
*  I think the Trump regime only knows one gear, and that's the maximalist response to any and all [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5128.719999999999s)]
*  opposition. However, as wrongheaded as I think this litigious aspect of their responses, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5138.96s)]
*  I think they're responding to something real, which is that these deep state people, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5147.76s)]
*  these warmongering, neocon people, they're leaking these reports because they want to go back in. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5153.36s)]
*  It's just the truth. When are they ever leaking reports like, oh, the military didn't really do [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5160.72s)]
*  a good enough job. That's not a thing. That's not something you're gonna get [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5166.24s)]
*  three days after something happened. They're doing it because it's like, no, we need to escalate [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5170.48s)]
*  even further. And I think the Trump administration, to their credit, rightfully understand that an [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5177.04s)]
*  escalation would inevitably lead to all out war. Iran's response by hitting our bases, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5183.5199999999995s)]
*  telling us ahead of time to do as little impact as possible, even though we're told constantly [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5191.36s)]
*  that the Iranians are part of a death cult who want to just kill everybody. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5196.48s)]
*  And so it was able to give Trump and them a win to be like, all right, we did it, we're wiping our [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5201.839999999999s)]
*  hands, we're done. They're leaking this into New York Times and say, no, we need to go do more, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5207.12s)]
*  which is then going to mean what? The Iranians didn't have to react in kind. And then when they [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5212.4s)]
*  do actually strike us for real, hit our military personnel, not the freaking Israelis, our military [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5218.32s)]
*  personnel in the region, then we have to escalate even further. And that escalation leads to this [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5226.639999999999s)]
*  and then inevitably means boots on the ground in freaking Iran. That's why they're doing this [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5232.719999999999s)]
*  in the New York Times and in CNN. And yes, Trump's response is ridiculous because he doesn't know [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5238.639999999999s)]
*  any other gears. He doesn't know how to modulate. But I think their instinct here is the right one. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5244.4s)]
*  The reason why they're criticizing a military action. Think about that. When do the Times [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5250.56s)]
*  just CNN criticize military actions abroad? Never, they're only doing it because they want to do more. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5256.8s)]
*  And so as nasty and stupid as the responses from the Trump people, I think they have a point here. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5264.4s)]
*  Yeah, so I totally agree with was but they could have just said it like was. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5272.4s)]
*  And like we said yesterday on the show with, look, there's evidence. You could create evidence on [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5277.12s)]
*  both sides. And in fact, our intelligence should create evidence on both sides. Hey, here's a report [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5283.28s)]
*  saying that we think we might have done enough damage. Here's a report saying we think we might [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5287.12s)]
*  not have done enough damage. We're not sure. And that's why we have these two different reports. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5290.72s)]
*  But you don't see both reports. One of them gets picked up by someone who wants to create more [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5294.64s)]
*  war leak to the New York Times and CNN. And New York Times and CNN don't give you any context into, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5299.28s)]
*  this is a warmonger giving me this leak to create more war. They just say it like, that's it, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5304.24s)]
*  it's definitive, right? And to be fair to the New York Times, they didn't say that it was definitive, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5309.12s)]
*  but it leaves that impression. And they're great at leaving that impression about how we need to [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5312.8s)]
*  go to more war just look at what they did during the Iraq war. Having said that, there's no reason [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5317.759999999999s)]
*  to say that the New York Times is unpatriotic. Reporters don't have to be patriotic. They just [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5322.24s)]
*  have to be accurate, right? There's no need to say that our own intelligence, even if it's [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5327.04s)]
*  cherry picked, is enemy propaganda or reports about it. So yeah, the fact that they can't [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5333.36s)]
*  modulate discredits them and is problematic, especially in a situation like this, where they're [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5338.56s)]
*  generally speaking largely right about not escalating the war and not using cherry-picked [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5343.6s)]
*  intelligence to escalate it. Last thing, two things I wanna get to is the stuff I promised you guys. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5349.2s)]
*  So now Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News for some edit they did and Jesse Waters said something about [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5354.64s)]
*  a call between him and Trump. Honestly, the rest of the story is totally uninteresting. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5360.48s)]
*  He's doing it for media attention, but he's also doing it a little bit like Trump to intimidate [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5364.56s)]
*  the press. You better not write anything or say anything negative about me. So this is another [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5368.88s)]
*  giant problem with how Trump goes about this. Because when you start having politicians [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5372.96s)]
*  threatening to sue anyone who criticizes them, as we told you when Trump first started doing it, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5378.8s)]
*  now all politicians will say, that's it, you can't criticize me at all, I'm suing everyone. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5384.320000000001s)]
*  And that's a giant problem. And finally, we get to the funny part. So Donald Trump was very clear. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5389.2s)]
*  He said the intelligence was very inconclusive. The intelligence says we don't know, which is [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5396.400000000001s)]
*  what I told you a minute ago. Now Jesse Waters partly agrees, but then partly tells us he knows [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5404.24s)]
*  exactly what happened. Let's watch. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5410.48s)]
*  Do you think they're getting it from some sort of nefarious Iranian sources and- [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5412.719999999999s)]
*  Some hater in the Pentagon leaked an early report that had no confidence and just relied on some [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5417.76s)]
*  camera up in the sky. That's it. It's not like there's some Israeli spy down there in the rubble [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5424.24s)]
*  with a phone. Yep, we killed this thing. Can you guys send some food? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5429.68s)]
*  You're never gonna know what happened because the thing is a pile of rubble. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5434.64s)]
*  This was such a precise strike. They put these bombs down the mountain's ventilation shaft. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5441.92s)]
*  They put these things untouched and it slid down the ventilation shaft and exploded in the main [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5449.68s)]
*  hall and then collapsed the roof of the cavern and caused a fire. You could even see the [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5457.44s)]
*  discoloration at the top of the mountain. They compared the target to something the size of a [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5463.759999999999s)]
*  refrigerator. This was as precise a strike as you can get. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5469.12s)]
*  Is that amazing? That was in the same segment. He said there's no way of knowing what happened [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5475.04s)]
*  with the bomb. Let me tell you exactly what happened with the bomb. It slid down the tunnel [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5480.719999999999s)]
*  shaft and it got there past Mohammed and then saw a sandwich that was left by. It turns out [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5485.6s)]
*  it was a falafel sandwich, but there's no way of knowing what happened. But then, come on, Jesse, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5491.120000000001s)]
*  come on. If you're gonna lie, at least give it a little bit of space between the two lies. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5496.0s)]
*  So this terrible story with an amusing ending. Okay. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5502.0s)]
*  If he's that good though, he's gotta get off the air at Fox News immediately and join the CIA. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5506.08s)]
*  They need him in the intelligence. If he knows it went down that ventilation chute and all of that [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5512.64s)]
*  stuff, it's incredible, okay? He's either a genius or a fascinating storyteller, okay? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5518.56s)]
*  Either way, he's the best. He's the best. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5524.320000000001s)]
*  And by the way, they dropped it from 13,000 feet, but it didn't explode. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5526.4800000000005s)]
*  It slid down the tunnel shaft and then exploded later. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5530.88s)]
*  Likely story. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5534.96s)]
*  Incredible. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5535.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5536.08s)]
*  He's the award. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5537.46s)]
*  Jesus, man. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5538.5s)]
*  An award season yet. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5539.3s)]
*  All right, we gotta take a break. We gotta take a break. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5540.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5543.3s)]
*  Okay, when we come back, lots of amazing stories, so come right back. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5543.7s)]
*  The nuclear material might not have been there. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5550.34s)]
*  All right, let's go to Super Chat. Titan writes, and Cenk, when you go on other shows, don't use [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5566.58s)]
*  the word Islamophobia. Start calling this straight up racist. Shout it at every chance [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5595.38s)]
*  because this racism against Arabs needs to be challenged. Islamophobia just doesn't convey it. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5599.3s)]
*  Mission accomplished. I almost never use the word Islamophobia. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5604.58s)]
*  And so it's not because I don't fight back against racism or bigotry against Muslims. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5608.0199999999995s)]
*  It's because it doesn't work. I've never seen the word Islamophobia [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5614.18s)]
*  have someone go, right, you're right. I'm afraid of Muslims. I'm now going to change my mind. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5619.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know why, but it's a word that doesn't really convince anyone. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5624.26s)]
*  And so, and you could say how it doesn't matter. They are Islamophobia, I'm gonna call them that. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5629.06s)]
*  No problem. I'm just telling you what in my experience is more effective and less effective [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5633.7s)]
*  at actually protecting my community, okay? And even bigotry doesn't land as well as racism, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5638.900000000001s)]
*  to be honest. I totally agree with Titan. And that's why a lot of times I'll say it's racist. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5644.900000000001s)]
*  And they'll go, well, technically Muslim and just know you can't be racist against religion. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5648.900000000001s)]
*  Okay, yeah, yeah, you go make that argument. All right, 00083 says, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5652.82s)]
*  Cenk, the Democrats are duplicitous cowards that always stab you in the back while they say there [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5656.58s)]
*  was nothing we could do, all the while secretly agreeing with Republicans. That was a reference [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5660.42s)]
*  to the Kirsten Gillibrand story. And then I think I read your comment before I went off on her and [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5664.34s)]
*  it was stuck in my head and I said something similar because of you, I hope you're happy. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5669.139999999999s)]
*  Okay, no, but seriously, thank you for writing in. Obviously, I agree with you. Deb Long wrote in, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5672.98s)]
*  so never again doesn't apply to Palestinians. Got it, absolutely disgusting. I have a thing [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5677.38s)]
*  about the little girl carrying her sister on her back and wonder what happened to her. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5682.1s)]
*  It's heartbreaking. Look, guys, I want you to go to bravenewfilms.org and watch the movie Gaza, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5685.700000000001s)]
*  Journalists Under Fire. But I'm gonna do a little bit of damage to that cause by telling you that [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5690.660000000001s)]
*  every time they showed a video of a little girl on the screen with her parents, I was like, no, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5697.54s)]
*  please, please don't let her be one of the ones that were killed, please. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5703.38s)]
*  It's such a heartbreaking. All you gotta do is see one or two kids who died out of the [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5707.22s)]
*  17,000 and it'll enrage you. You can't believe that we're, the thing that struck me is [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5711.86s)]
*  they had the same phrase out of the Holocaust that they did for the Palestinians were saying [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5719.86s)]
*  in Gaza, which is, where's the world? Why won't the world come to save us? Why won't the world do [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5726.58s)]
*  anything? Where's the whole world? Don't they see what's happening to us? [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5735.0599999999995s)]
*  But Kirsten Gillibrand's worried about offending AIPAC with words, okay. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5738.9s)]
*  Land of the free, home of my ran. Sorry, Marjorie Taylor Greene is the walking embodiment of [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5747.219999999999s)]
*  embodiment of loud ignorance, Islamophobia, conspiracy garbage, hate wrapped in Bible quotes. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5751.62s)]
*  She's not a patriot, she's a national embarrassment. Marjorie Taylor Greene [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5757.0599999999995s)]

*  All right, back on TYT, Cenk, Waz and Sharon with you guys. Sharon's got the next story. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5795.62s)]
*  Kamala Harris, are donors pulling on her? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5817.7s)]
*  But first, the debate of the 2024 presidential campaign is now history. The fallout from it is [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5823.3s)]
*  just getting started. Joining us now is Vice President Kamala Harris. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5828.58s)]
*  I'm talking about three and a half years of performance in work that has been historic. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5831.46s)]
*  But is that the man who we saw on the stage tonight? Is that the other guy on the debate stage? [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5837.7s)]
*  I'm not gonna spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5843.3s)]
*  when I've been watching the last three and a half years of performance. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5847.38s)]
*  You tried, didn't she? Former Vice President Kamala Harris has yet to announce her next [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5853.78s)]
*  move politically. But according to a report from Politico, some California Democratic donors, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5858.26s)]
*  they are not thrilled about the idea of her running for governor. Still upset with how she ran [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5863.46s)]
*  defense for former President Joe Biden, like in that interview we just showed you with Anderson [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5869.700000000001s)]
*  Cooper. Let's tell you more about the donors, just a little bit more about what they're saying. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5875.14s)]
*  But Cenk, what did you think about this scoop, in particular the details? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5879.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Kamala, I got basically two words for you, don't run. I think she's walking into a trap. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5886.02s)]
*  And there's a top reason why I think she'll be a terrible candidate, among many. But there's one [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5894.58s)]
*  that you really gotta know. We'll get to that in a little bit, but let's find out the rest of the [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5902.26s)]
*  story. All right, according to one anonymous donor who gave six figures to Harris's 2024 campaign, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5905.3s)]
*  here's the statement anonymously. Kamala just reminds you, we are in this complete S storm, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5912.66s)]
*  Biden. We got bamboozled. I think she did the best she could in that situation, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5921.38s)]
*  but obviously she knew about the cognitive decline too. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5925.3s)]
*  I've written so many checks because I knew the Trump administration would be horrible. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5930.099999999999s)]
*  We're living in a nightmare because of the Democrats. I'm furious at them, truly. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5934.26s)]
*  Southern California fundraiser had similar thoughts, here they are. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5939.86s)]
*  Donors realize it's just gonna bring up the whole pathetic last presidential, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5943.459999999999s)]
*  which no one wants to hear about again. And then it's the whole, did you know Joe Biden thing? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5947.86s)]
*  She stood still. She still probably would probably leave, apologies, but honestly, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5955.379999999999s)]
*  no one is incredibly pumped. According to Scott Drexel, Bay Area based donor advisor, here's [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5962.179999999999s)]
*  this to consider. Many Democratic givers don't blame Harris for the November outcome, but [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5968.820000000001s)]
*  neither are they inclined to see Harris waltz into the race and expect the party to automatically [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5974.02s)]
*  pull behind her. And others told political that the longer Harris waits, the less momentum she has. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5979.3s)]
*  Drexel stated this, it's very fair to say there's not an overwhelming clamor for her candidacy. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5987.22s)]
*  Very hard to hard for there to be one if it's not 100% clear if she really wants to do it. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=5993.46s)]
*  Mather Martin, San Francisco based fundraiser who worked on previous Harris campaigns told [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6000.82s)]
*  Politico, there was more enthusiasm at first. I think it waned a bit. But Martin also stated [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6005.219999999999s)]
*  that he believes Harris could still run a strong campaign, campaign for governor of California. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6012.58s)]
*  According to Politico, Harris plans to make a decision on her future plans in late summer. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6017.78s)]
*  These are the three options she's weighing. Or mention run for California governor in 2026, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6023.0599999999995s)]
*  run for president in 2028, or stay a private citizen, make money, stay out of politics. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6029.86s)]
*  You weigh in on this, well, you already told us that you would advise her do not run. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6041.139999999999s)]
*  Should it be disqualifying? I personally think it should be, okay? If you sat by and you watched [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6048.66s)]
*  all this, I also think it should be disqualifying for the media. And frankly, folks like Jake Tapper, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6053.78s)]
*  who are paid to tell us the truth, but are now getting paid for some book that'll probably be [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6058.98s)]
*  turned into a movie, actor, we needed to know what we needed to know. But you guys weigh in on what [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6063.0599999999995s)]
*  you think of the reporting here and what it might mean. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6069.78s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a ton of reasons not to run. So what if she loses and she gets Andrew Cromote, [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6073.219999999999s)]
*  right? And then leaves her career basically in an embarrassing fashion. She's gonna have to answer [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6079.38s)]
*  the Biden question. There's many, many more, but there's one that I wanna focus on. She's not sure [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6085.219999999999s)]
*  if she wants to run and people aren't overly excited about her. Why? What's the core reason? [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6089.46s)]
*  The core reason is because she's not actually trying to fix something. She's not running to [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6095.7s)]
*  get something done. So for example, if I was gonna run in the time that I did run, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6101.78s)]
*  I told you guys, we gotta get money out of politics. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6108.179999999999s)]
*  And nobody's willing to do it. In order to do it, you have to actually call out both Republicans [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6111.46s)]
*  and Democrats by name. And you have to show how much money they're getting from all these donors. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6116.259999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, people are never going to see it. You see how animated I am by it. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6121.54s)]
*  Do you see Kamala Harris being animated by anything? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6126.18s)]
*  She's trying to decide what's good for her career. And no one even realizes that's the problem. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6130.18s)]
*  Nobody cares about your career. Maybe reporters do and other Democrats do. But the voters care [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6137.9400000000005s)]
*  about what you're gonna do for them. And she hasn't even thought about that yet. It doesn't [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6144.34s)]

*  former vice president and I had a chance to run California, I would do it. Why would I do it? [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6155.46s)]
*  Because I'd be like, we haven't fixed homelessness at all. And we spent $24 billion. That's where [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6160.18s)]

*  things. But she's like, should I run for president? Should I run for governor? Should I go run [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6169.620000000001s)]
*  something else? Me, me, me, me, me, me. All these corporate Democrats are just empty shells. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6174.66s)]
*  That's the number one problem. Waz, what do you think? [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6180.5s)]
*  Man, so beautifully said, Cenk. She's one of the emptiest suits in politics. There's just no, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6183.54s)]
*  there's no there there. There's nothing there. And a couple of things about that political piece [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6190.34s)]
*  stuck out to me. One, what Cenk already mentioned, and no point do they say, [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6197.0599999999995s)]
*  well, this is the purpose of the candidacy. This will be the purpose of her campaign. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6201.22s)]
*  This will be the purpose of her time in office in the governor's mansion. Never comes up. She has [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6205.9400000000005s)]
*  no reason for being in two. I love how the owners of the party, the big money donors, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6213.22s)]
*  the consultant class let themselves off the hook. We were bamboozled. You guys are idiots. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6222.42s)]
*  It's either you're idiots or you're lying to us. There are no two answers. If Joe Schmo walking [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6231.22s)]

*  connections could somehow be fooled into thinking the Biden thing was gonna work. I love the [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6250.18s)]
*  inconvenient letting, they tricked us. We just had no idea. We run the entire party. We call [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6255.7s)]
*  all the shots. We're the big money, big wigs, but we couldn't do anything, Sharon. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6263.46s)]
*  It was just out of our hands with the Biden thing. It's pathetic. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6270.66s)]
*  I think you're both so right. And I would even go further. You both have me convinced that even [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6273.78s)]
*  this article being written, this so-called scoop is part of the problem. Going to these anonymous [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6279.3s)]
*  billionaires, these rich people who are truly running things is actually part of the problem. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6285.3s)]
*  Okay, but I agree with you. There is no passion. It's not a mistake. They didn't even think about [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6290.900000000001s)]
*  asking about, well, what would you do? What would she do? What is she itching to do? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6297.3s)]
*  We like people, I think, in America today still who make us feel something. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6304.26s)]
*  Maybe you creep me out. Maybe you make me feel this passion and love for you, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6311.62s)]
*  but I gotta feel something. I don't feel anything here. The circumstances make me a little angry, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6316.259999999999s)]
*  sure, a lot angry, but the person, you're right, I could care less what she does. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6322.9s)]
*  What's the platform? What are you running on? What are you gonna do? And I wish that [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6329.7s)]
*  they came and put their name on this. I thought rich guys, well, some like to run things secretly, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6334.74s)]
*  I guess. Yeah, so last two quick things here. One is our poll, because I'm curious about it. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6339.46s)]
*  We always do a poll on the live chat. Shows live 6 to 8 PM Eastern. So what should commonwealth's [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6344.58s)]
*  next move be run for governor, run for president, or live a private life? I'm curious what you guys [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6351.22s)]
*  said about that. We'll pull that up in a second. And then the last point I wanted to make is, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6357.14s)]
*  the donors are also guilty of one other thing. They're the ones who wanted the empty suits in [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6362.18s)]
*  the first place. The reason they wanted the empty suits and they didn't care whether Biden had [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6366.34s)]
*  dementia or didn't have dementia is because they tell the politicians what to do. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6370.82s)]
*  So they don't want the politicians to be too independent. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6376.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6378.66s)]
*  And have a lot of their own ideas. They said, no, no, no, I want you to do my ideas, not your ideas. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6379.38s)]
*  If you're an empty vessel, that's awesome for the donors. So now them complaining about empty [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6384.9800000000005s)]
*  vessels is hilarious and ironic. Okay, we got the poll. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6389.7s)]
*  No. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6396.42s)]
*  Okay, well, you know what, guys? That's why you gotta watch the show live and then you can see it [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6399.54s)]
*  in the live chat. All right. Okay, we gotta take a break. When we come back, we've got at least [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6405.14s)]

*  Kamala's complicity in hiding Biden's decline made her into a big Trump collaborator. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6480.9s)]
*  That's a great point. I mean, that's what I ran as a protest candidate. Why? I was like, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6485.62s)]
*  I actually want to beat Trump. And this guy's not gonna beat him. It's super obvious. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6490.74s)]
*  But they're like, no, no, no, no, no. All about Biden's ego, then all about Kamala's ego. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6494.9s)]

*  doing this for so long. This is gonna get your blood pressure up. Cruel and unusual is perhaps [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6715.14s)]
*  an understatement. ICE agents just arrested a six year old cancer patient at an immigration [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6722.1s)]
*  courthouse. A child with leukemia taken from a courtroom hallway in front of his mother and [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6729.3s)]
*  nine year old sister shipped off to a detention center in Texas. Cenk, I'm gonna throw it to you [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6735.14s)]

*  The cruelty does seem to be deliberate. The mother, according to the LA Times and her two kids, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6749.62s)]
*  fled Honduras after what the lawsuit describes as imminent menacing death threats. Six year old son [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6756.9s)]
*  had already endured two years of chemo treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. They did exactly [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6764.0199999999995s)]
*  what asylum seekers are told to do. They waited in Mexico. They applied legally through the app, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6771.0599999999995s)]
*  the CBP One app. They were granted parole into the United States. So there you have it, [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6775.94s)]
*  did everything right. They had a court hearing in LA. That was on May 29. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6782.1s)]
*  After the judge dismissed their case, plain clothes ICE agents were waiting in the hallway. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6786.34s)]
*  They grabbed all three in front of everyone. Six year old boy, terrified, he urinated on himself, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6791.860000000001s)]

*  and the children were crying in fear. And then they were flown to San Antonio, transported to [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6803.540000000001s)]
*  a detention center in Dilley, Texas, where they remain in prison. Cruel is a word we're using a [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6808.98s)]
*  lot lately for good reasons, but it just seems like the depths of it. It's like how low can you [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6817.379999999999s)]
*  go? I still think there's more room to go with what's going on here, Jay. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6824.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so here's what American people are not interested in, cruelty. I don't know when [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6830.26s)]
*  Stephen Miller and Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are gonna get it through their dumb ass heads, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6837.22s)]
*  right? So they think that everyone is just as cool as they are. So they do the projection. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6842.34s)]
*  But no, what American people wanted was justice. And so were they frustrated? Yes. Did they feel [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6848.82s)]
*  like, hey, we're having to pay for everything, whether it's the undocumented immigrants or the [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6857.3s)]
*  foreign aid and all this stuff. And we never get anything. We're always giving out, but we never [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6863.38s)]
*  get anything. Well, I follow all the rules. And now all of a sudden, with the crime was on the rise [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6869.06s)]
*  and everybody's crossing the border. And it felt like no one else has to play by the rules and [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6873.3s)]
*  they were pissed. And that's why they elected Trump. But they didn't elect them to chase after [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6878.1s)]
*  six-year-old leukemia patients. But the dumb ass doesn't know that. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6884.9800000000005s)]
*  So he just keeps doing this to make like 20% of the country, his base, the radical right, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6889.54s)]
*  happy. And they are, they love this. They're like, this is what we voted for. Okay, congratulations. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6896.82s)]
*  But 80% of the rest of us don't agree. And I know in their bubble, they think everyone is just as [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6902.42s)]
*  cruel as they are. Sorry, guys, we're not. We're not the radical right. And so Rogan agrees, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6907.46s)]
*  we agree. It doesn't matter. You could do a poll on it. You'll see. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6913.46s)]
*  If you think the American people really want you to chase down people who've been living here 10, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6918.18s)]
*  20 years, find their six-year-olds, treat them like crap, find out they have leukemia, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6922.42s)]
*  and don't let them go back to get treatment, you're nuts. The American people are not that cruel. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6928.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's obvious what the game plan is in terms of Stephen Miller, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6933.54s)]
*  where he literally had a meeting. This is reported. He had a meeting with ICE officials and said, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6943.94s)]
*  why are you guys going after criminals? Go to Home Depot. So literally, the game is over. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6949.86s)]
*  This idea that there are these hundreds of thousands, if not millions of horrible criminal [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6957.78s)]
*  immigrants out there that we're just dying to get rid of as the Trump administration, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6963.62s)]
*  we've already dispensed with that pretext. It's over for that. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6969.62s)]
*  And it's cliche to say it, but the cruelty is the point in terms of it's part of the actual game [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6974.18s)]
*  plan. They know that immigration, excuse me, net deportations right now, I think there are 200,000. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6983.06s)]
*  That's in six months. They're on pace of 400,000 for the year. That would be less than 2 million [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6989.9400000000005s)]
*  if you extrapolate that over four years. That's not what they sold to the people who wanted to [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=6998.18s)]
*  see a reduction in the migrant population. And so their thinking is that they gotta do stuff so [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7004.1s)]
*  outlandish, so ghoulish that folks will quote unquote self deport. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7011.22s)]
*  And that's literally the point of all of this. They want people thinking like, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7016.42s)]
*  oh my God, they'll even kick out a cancer patient. So I might as well just go back to where I came [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7020.66s)]
*  from. And so we can't be surprised, but people are standing up and people are making their voices [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7026.5s)]
*  heard. But yeah, in the meantime, it's just going to be more just ghoulish behavior from [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7034.18s)]
*  this administration. Let me give you the government's defense real quick. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7043.06s)]
*  Tricia McLaughlin, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs claimed the Boyce case [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7046.66s)]
*  had already been thrown out by an immigration judge and that the family is quote, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7051.06s)]
*  not being denied emergency care, but they were denied the ability to keep a scheduled cancer [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7055.3s)]
*  checkup. That was on June 5th. Mother's attorney says Ice did nothing to monitor her son's condition [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7060.18s)]
*  for days after the arrest. Six-year-old child has leukemia, not a national security threat. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7065.62s)]
*  Sick little boy just started learning English, going to public school in LA. Family was living [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7071.38s)]
*  with relatives in the area. They were doing things the right way. Kate Ibsen-Kumar, who is [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7077.54s)]
*  a staff attorney for the Texas Civil Rights Project's Beyond Borders program, represents [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7084.34s)]
*  the family. She argues that detention violated constitutional protection, specifically the Fourth [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7088.18s)]
*  and Fifth Amendments, guaranteeing due process, preventing unlawful seizures. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7093.38s)]
*  Her statement to the LA Times, they asked, they followed the process, went where they were [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7098.34s)]
*  supposed to go, did everything that was asked of them, and they're being punished for it. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7103.22s)]
*  So final thoughts here, this is not, I saw today that the Bush Institute put out a statement on [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7108.58s)]
*  immigration and how half of the people detained, and you talked about the numbers, woes, but half [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7115.86s)]
*  of the people detained at least. No criminal record, nothing. Like you said, Jane, it's not [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7121.94s)]
*  what anyone signed up for. No one signed up for this. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7129.46s)]
*  Yeah, so look, they had a legal right to be here, and they say, yeah, I know, but we gotta [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7133.219999999999s)]
*  beat Obama's record, which I'll tell you about in a second, okay? And then so, but you have to [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7138.179999999999s)]
*  realize there's a second disastrous part of this. They showed up for an asylum hearing like they [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7143.94s)]
*  were supposed to. They're following the law and the rules. They're like, okay, we were told to [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7148.5s)]
*  come back to court, and they came back to court. Perfect, that's what we want. But they've now been [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7154.0199999999995s)]
*  snatching people up from court like that all the time. This is one of many stories we've reported [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7160.259999999999s)]
*  like this. So what is that going to lead to? Nobody's gonna show up to court anymore. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7164.98s)]
*  So if they got paroled inside the country, you'd be nuts to show up to an asylum hearing [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7169.94s)]
*  or to any kind of immigration proceeding, cuz they're not gonna have that proceeding. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7174.74s)]
*  They're just gonna detain you and then send you back. So it's gonna be counterproductive. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7178.259999999999s)]
*  And all this because Obama once had around 430,000 people in one year that he sent back, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7184.74s)]
*  and they can't seem to beat that record. So Stephen Miller's in this sweaty mess, like, [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7193.299999999999s)]
*  I have to beat Obama. So how did Obama do it? Back then there wasn't sanctuary cities, [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7197.94s)]
*  there was a program called Secure Cities. They could lobby to bring that back and they could say, [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7202.5s)]
*  hey, that happened under Obama. That would be a rational way to do it. No, God forbid. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7206.259999999999s)]
*  And then he would process them at the border, but that involves processing them. And they're like, [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7210.5s)]
*  what a pain in the ass to process them and then to remove them. No, just follow the law. Obama [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7215.62s)]
*  followed the law and deported more than you guys did. That's why they called him the reporter in [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7220.98s)]
*  chief. But the second problem they have, they can't solve. Back then there was a lot more [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7225.22s)]
*  people coming. Now there's less people coming. So since there's less people coming, even if [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7229.14s)]
*  they did exactly what Obama did, they couldn't get to his number. So that's why they're having [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7233.3s)]
*  to go pick up cancer patients and kids and start kidnapping people from the middle of the country [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7238.02s)]
*  that have been here for a long, long time. We said send the criminals back. That's what the [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7245.780000000001s)]
*  American people said. When you do this, you lose your popularity. The only good news I see out of [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7250.5s)]
*  this is it'll make their immigration policy so unpopular that it'll cost them in the long run. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7255.54s)]
*  All right, we got to run. I've got two guests for you guys coming up. Dan Holloway and Jesse [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7263.06s)]
*  Marl. I talked to them before the election. We're gonna check in to see what they think so far [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7269.06s)]
*  of how Trump is going. My guess is they're gonna think that he's going really well, [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7274.98s)]
*  but we'll find out. So stay here. You'll all get to see it. And I wanna thank Sharon, and you can [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7278.26s)]
*  check her out on Rebel headquarters. And Woz is not only at the ringer, which you should definitely [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7283.38s)]
*  read, but check out that Woz Speaks podcast where you do that great podcast on Mom Donnie. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7287.7s)]
*  Love you guys. Have a good weekend, okay? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7293.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7295.54s)]
*  All right, back on The Young Turks. So before the election, I debated a couple of right wing [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7398.26s)]
*  podcasters. One of them is Dan Holloway, host of the Drinking Bros podcast and the Citizen podcast. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7417.860000000001s)]
*  I wanted to do a check-in and probably get frustrated. So let's do it. Dan, how are you [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7423.7s)]
*  doing? I'm living the dream. How about you? Well, kinda. So all right, let's start with this, Dan. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7427.7s)]
*  So far, are you happy with Trump? For the most part, yeah. I mean, look, there's always some [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7435.86s)]
*  gripes and complaints. And I think no matter what's going on, it's incumbent upon people to be harder [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7440.74s)]
*  on their own side than the other side, whatever you consider yourself to be. Because that's how [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7447.22s)]
*  we fine tune things, right? I mean, that should be the incubator at the lowest possible level with [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7452.0199999999995s)]
*  the people you agree with the most and then move that more broadly out. And we can, you and people [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7456.9s)]
*  like me and you can have debates after that. But I would say mostly, we talked about this back in [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7461.54s)]
*  November, but the election for me was about three things. One is securing the homeland, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7468.42s)]
*  specifically the border, which I think is, they're doing a good job there. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7472.9s)]
*  Second is getting debt, which is to mean spending under control. That's not happened. And then [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7476.82s)]
*  advancing the country, and to me that means American soft power and then innovating as well [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7482.42s)]
*  and trying to stay out of direct ground combat wars. Okay, that's been a mixed bag as well, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7487.86s)]
*  but more or less, yeah. Okay, yeah, all right, that seems like an honest analysis. So that's [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7493.86s)]
*  exactly what we expect from you. So before we get to war in America first, which is what I'm most [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7498.66s)]
*  interested in for the purposes of this conversation, give me one or two things that you're unhappy with [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7503.54s)]
*  on the Trump administration. Yeah, what I'm, we'll see the thing that I'm most unhappy about [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7509.38s)]
*  is the inability to codify spending cuts. And to me, that's mostly not a Trump problem, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7516.1s)]
*  that's a Congress problem. I mean, we know these people aren't gonna do this stuff. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7521.7s)]
*  I've seen very little movement on that. And for Trump's part, the big beautiful bill don't support [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7526.5s)]
*  that at all. I think omnibus bills were the devil 12 months ago. And from my perspective, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7533.54s)]
*  they're still not good. So you're not gonna convince me that they're great now no matter what [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7539.3s)]
*  is in them and no matter what clever name Trump comes up with for it. I'm not gonna support that. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7545.3s)]
*  I understand why you would do it because you've got Congress to get through and you're trying [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7551.3s)]
*  to get a lot of stuff done in four years. You don't have the opportunity to get reelected, [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7556.0199999999995s)]
*  stuff like that. But I haven't seen anything to really persuade Congress to cut spending or [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7559.3s)]
*  codify any of the Doge cuts, which is mostly ways for on abuse or anything like that. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7567.06s)]
*  And personally, I think it's a fantasy that the Senate rescission bill is gonna significantly [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7571.14s)]
*  cut anything. I really just don't believe that. I mean, they were celebrating over, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7575.7s)]
*  I think $9 billion in Doge cuts, which would fund the government for 12 hours. So that's nothing, [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7579.7s)]
*  right? Yeah, that's exactly right. Okay, so I'm curious about the details though, [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7585.14s)]
*  because I agree with a lot of what you just said. The omnibus bills are a problem because [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7589.54s)]
*  they just stuff it full of pork and they stuff it with all these [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7593.46s)]
*  extraneous things. And then you never get to find out, hey, what do they think about this or that? [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7596.42s)]
*  They should view, and Tom Massey agrees with us and so do people on the left, right? [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7600.02s)]
*  So but we probably disagree on some of the spending cuts. So real quick, give me your [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7605.14s)]
*  thoughts on these three, right? So one is the Medicaid and SNAP cuts. I'm against them. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7611.7s)]
*  They're about 1.1 trillion and we're also doing tax cut for people making above $500,000. That's [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7616.74s)]
*  also 1.1 trillion. So I think that is just taking it from the poor and giving to the rich. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7623.0599999999995s)]
*  If you didn't give them to the rich, then I say, okay, well, at least you're saving money, etc. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7627.139999999999s)]
*  So but I'm curious what you think about that. And then progressive Ro Khanna, he found like 12 [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7631.0599999999995s)]
*  trillion in cuts, but you'd have to cut the Pentagon. I'm curious what you think about that. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7636.58s)]
*  And things like oil subsidies, we give away $17 billion every single year to the oil companies. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7641.219999999999s)]
*  So what's your take on those three? [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7646.099999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's complex, right? Obviously, all of these things are. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7647.38s)]
*  As far as Medicaid and SNAP go, I think that, so this is my position. I think you and I will [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7652.34s)]
*  probably disagree with this, but I think it's the citizens job to take care of each other, [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7659.219999999999s)]
*  not the government. I don't trust government to do that. And they've shown historically that [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7664.179999999999s)]
*  they're not only incapable of doing it, but they hold the ability to do it over your head to extract [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7668.18s)]
*  more labor and wealth from the population. That to me is unacceptable. Now, people in general [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7673.06s)]
*  will get the government that they ask for. And by asking for, I mean, if you sit around, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7678.58s)]
*  if you don't know your neighbor's name and don't talk to those people and go down there and help [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7684.18s)]
*  them, then you're gonna get big government coming in trying to have these super wasteful Medicaid [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7687.14s)]
*  and SNAP benefits programs that take money out of your pocket. And that's exactly what they do. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7692.1s)]
*  The problem is, it is a legitimate problem and it's not being addressed. I tell people this on my [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7696.1s)]
*  shows all the time. Just because you don't like somebody's solution to a problem doesn't mean it [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7701.22s)]
*  doesn't exist. And if you pretend it doesn't, then people that you disagree with or even that [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7704.900000000001s)]
*  are bad actors are gonna come in and solve that problem. What I haven't heard is any kind of [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7709.22s)]
*  legitimate replacement for that, right? And it's the same as Obamacare. I believe the Republican [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7714.900000000001s)]
*  Congress voted 63 times over a 10 year period or so to repeal Obamacare when they never had the [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7720.82s)]
*  votes to do it. They had the votes two times in 2019 and they voted twice to end it and seven and [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7727.38s)]
*  nine Republicans respectively voted to keep it, right? These people are full of it. None of them [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7734.179999999999s)]
*  actually wanna solve any of these problems because solved problems don't get out the vote. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7739.299999999999s)]
*  When it comes to tax cuts, that to me is the wrong conversation. We should be talking [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7742.9s)]
*  about cutting spending, right? If you cut spending, there's no need for these taxes. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7750.66s)]
*  But because these people in Washington refuse to even participate in that conversation [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7754.66s)]
*  at all, then we're never gonna get that, right? I mean, this is you and I having a conversation [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7759.0599999999995s)]
*  where we agree about 95% of stuff. We just disagree on how to solve it. But the reality [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7764.42s)]
*  of the situation is that nobody in Washington representatives even cares about solving this [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7769.22s)]
*  problem. Yeah, so look, you're right that we have plenty to disagree on there. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7773.22s)]
*  And if we sat down and figured out how to do Medicaid and SNAP or how to fix for those issues, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7777.62s)]
*  that would be a super interesting conversation. We have limited time here. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7784.5s)]
*  Well, the way I would solve it is I would stop letting churches get tax-free status if they don't [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7787.78s)]
*  solve these problems, cuz that's the reason they're getting tax-free status. Am I right? [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7792.26s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's a really interesting idea. That's why it's important to have these [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7795.94s)]
*  conversations. But let's keep going. What did you think about, so I don't know if you saw, [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7799.46s)]
*  but I asked them to cut the Pentagon. They said they'd do it and I was thinking, [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7805.06s)]
*  yeah, believe me when I see it, right? Sure. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7808.5s)]
*  And then they didn't, they added to it. What was your take on that? [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7810.740000000001s)]
*  Well, I guess the question is, what would you cut from the Pentagon? [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7813.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, easy. They can't pass an audit. They say, I don't know where the four, [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7817.860000000001s)]
*  at least 400 billion is. Then I'm gonna give you 400 billion less [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7821.9400000000005s)]
*  until you figure out where the money's going. I think that's fair, yeah. I mean, honestly, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7826.1s)]
*  they haven't passed an audit, I think, since 2000. Is that right? I think that's what it is. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7830.02s)]
*  No, they've never passed an audit. Since they started auditing the Pentagon, [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7834.82s)]
*  they've never once passed one. That's not shocking to me, to be honest. But yeah, I mean, look, [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7838.42s)]
*  the sole function of the government is to protect the homeland, right? And I know that there are a [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7845.219999999999s)]
*  lot of people who are either pacifist or non-interventualist or people that are just, [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7850.5s)]
*  I guess, nihilistic about government being able to be trusted to do these things. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7855.139999999999s)]
*  And I understand that. I mean, the amount of damage that George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7859.46s)]
*  Donna Rumsfeld and their entire crew did to this country, where we can't look at [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7864.34s)]
*  a country like Iran and say, there's no way, and the world agrees, there's no way, even Saudi [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7869.38s)]
*  Arabia is like, you can't let them have nukes. And this is the conversation we should have been [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7873.9400000000005s)]
*  having in 96, when North Korea finally developed a bomb. Instead, Clinton was allowing China into [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7877.14s)]
*  the World Trade Organization with no caveats at all, as well as bombing Iraq for no reason and [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7883.54s)]
*  getting involved in Balkanization for no reason. That had nothing to do with us, but a nuclear [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7889.3s)]
*  North Korea has to do with a lot of people. And we had a lot of opportunity there, [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7893.86s)]
*  especially since China was begging to get into the WTO. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7897.38s)]
*  And all we had to do was say, okay, you make sure North Korea doesn't get nukes. That's the [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7900.58s)]
*  standard. If they get them, then you're out of the WTO period, and that would have been a good deal. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7904.74s)]
*  But we don't do that. That's American soft power, right? That's what we should be doing [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7909.219999999999s)]
*  instead of using all this military. I agree with you. I think the Pentagon's got an answer for [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7912.74s)]
*  this stuff. And it's very patriotic in a lot of ways to root for the DOD. But I root for the [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7917.62s)]
*  soldier, cuz that's what I was, right? I root for the guy on the ground not getting sent to do [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7923.94s)]
*  stupid stuff, one, getting taken care of when he comes back home, and then ensuring that we're [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7927.94s)]
*  actually using the right kind of American power to influence the world. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7932.66s)]
*  Yeah, so Dan, so let's get to war, right? So Trump bombs Iran, and at that point, [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7936.900000000001s)]
*  I was super pissed. And he said anti-war, and you're not anti-war if you start a war. Now, [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7946.58s)]
*  he did then demand a ceasefire and got one from Israel. For the moment being, [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7954.660000000001s)]
*  their defense minister today was threatening to end the ceasefire. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7962.0199999999995s)]
*  So first, give me a sense of how you reacted to both of those events. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7966.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I would have done that as well, given what I know about that situation for sure. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7972.9s)]
*  And I think it's hard to argue with the results. I don't like to do that necessarily, [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7977.78s)]
*  start from the outcome and work backwards when you're assessing something. Because [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7984.419999999999s)]
*  who knows if they actually knew, sometimes people get lucky. I don't think Trump got lucky here. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7988.18s)]
*  Nobody wants a nuclear Iran. Remember from the first administration, the Abraham Accords [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7992.58s)]
*  were a very good idea. He's trying to, for lack of a better phrase, weaponize the economic interests [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=7997.9400000000005s)]
*  of Middle Eastern countries so that they'll stop participating in this seventh century nonsense [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8004.34s)]
*  and move into modernity. It's very smart. That's what MBS is trying to do as well, [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8009.3s)]
*  and we should try to help these people do that. Now, and if Iran wants to continue doing this [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8012.58s)]
*  stuff, then the global community's got to deal with them in some way. And I'll say this as well. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8017.62s)]
*  When it comes to the Middle East, ceasefire is always appended with we'll see, right? I mean, [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8024.34s)]
*  there's no end to that situation until there is one and we'll see how it goes. But yeah, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8030.18s)]
*  I would have done the same thing as him, but I do understand the criticism as well as why I said, [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8034.58s)]
*  George W. Bush and his cronies, man, the damage they did where we can't look at a country like [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8039.62s)]
*  Iran and everybody agree like, no, we can't allow that. Let's not do any boots on the ground [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8045.62s)]
*  anywhere, but that can't happen. And people's minds right now can't even conceptualize that [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8050.5s)]
*  because of how much their trust was abused for the last 25 years, right? [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8054.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. So Dan, let me push back on a couple of things. It's not a debate. I kind of [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8059.94s)]
*  want to see where you're at these days so that it's more informational. But I'm curious, so with the [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8064.26s)]
*  nukes, I mean, Netanyahu has been telling us they're gonna have nukes within a couple of months [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8070.5s)]
*  since 1996, right? Load of crap. So they were enriching uranium more. I think they were using [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8076.02s)]
*  that as leverage to get us back into the peace treaty that we had. But they had no bomb, right? [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8082.5s)]
*  And they were at least, even Netanyahu admitted afterwards, at least a year away from having the [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8088.02s)]
*  bomb to put the uranium in. At least our own intelligence said they actually weren't even [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8092.9s)]
*  developing a bomb. Since 2003, they stopped it in the Ayatollah, did a religious edict saying [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8098.74s)]
*  nuclear weapons are terrible and no one should ever have them. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8104.5s)]
*  So if you said to me, Iran is about to have a nuke or you do this bombing, okay, that's an [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8107.94s)]
*  interesting question. But Iran wasn't about to have a nuke. It was largely propaganda. So that's why [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8114.82s)]
*  it wouldn't have done the bombing. The first was, and the other thing is, Dan, then it comes with [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8120.58s)]
*  risks, right? So in this case, it turned out okay for now because it didn't devolve further. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8124.02s)]
*  But what if Iran sank one of our ships? Then that's it. We're off to a gigantic war just like Iraq. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8131.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, that's a hypothetical and it's one that I don't really think is [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8136.34s)]
*  necessary, to be honest, cuz we've got recent memory of how they respond when we do something [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8142.34s)]
*  like this. We sent a switchblade through Soleimani's forehead and they did nothing, right? [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8146.900000000001s)]
*  So it was publicized this time that they called ahead to let people know and the US military by [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8153.94s)]
*  proxy that those rockets were on the way. That happened with the Soleimani thing as well. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8160.0199999999995s)]
*  You can reach into your DOD contacts and find that out. As far as Iran's ability and the timeline on [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8164.099999999999s)]
*  when they would get a bomb, when they've established that they want, when they say it openly, they also [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8171.379999999999s)]
*  say death to America and all this stuff. Certainly, part of it is barking. But this is what we said [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8175.139999999999s)]
*  about North Korea through the 80s and 90s. We said, they just rabble rouse from time to time [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8181.14s)]
*  so people will notice them and they can negotiate. And now they've got bombs, right? So at what point [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8185.46s)]
*  do you interdict that? I think it's a fair debate to have. At what point should we step in and make [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8191.54s)]
*  sure it doesn't happen? We messed it up pretty badly with North Korea. We had a lot of leverage [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8196.5s)]
*  against them, especially since they're basically a Chinese proxy and never used any of that. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8200.98s)]
*  We thought we would negotiate one on one with them, even Trump, to be fair, thought he was [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8206.9s)]
*  gonna negotiate one on one with that guy. And I don't think that was smart either. I don't think [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8211.619999999999s)]
*  that's something that we can do in the Mideast. But you don't wanna wait until the bomb exists. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8215.3s)]
*  And I'll say something else. You talk about risk. A lot of people on the, I guess you could say, [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8223.699999999999s)]
*  the anti-war side, although I don't think anybody's actually purely anti-war. People are anti-wars they [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8229.859999999999s)]
*  disagree with. But let's say that for the sake of this conversation. One of the comments was that [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8235.7s)]
*  Iran has escalatory dominance in the region. No, they don't. They could certainly do stuff that [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8243.060000000001s)]
*  might provoke us in the region, but we could wipe that country out in a couple of weeks if we wanted [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8248.26s)]
*  to without boots on the ground. We've got the munitions to do that. Not that we would or should, [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8252.66s)]
*  I'm not making a statement that we should, but Iran is gonna operate in its own best self-interest. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8256.1s)]
*  They're not a rational actor. They're trying to buy time so they can get a bomb, in my opinion. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8262.82s)]
*  This is the intelligence that I've seen. And you can talk to Persian people that have escaped that [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8267.14s)]
*  regime and they probably would agree with you, right? So I tend to listen when people bring up [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8271.3s)]
*  things like, excuse me, socialism or communism has never been done the right way or whatever. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8275.94s)]
*  And I hear somebody that's come from one of those countries tell me the evils of it. I tend to listen [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8281.3s)]
*  to the person that has the experience. Yeah, I think they're a terrible regime. But there's [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8286.26s)]
*  a dichotomy here where we say they're so incompetent they can't even strike back. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8290.82s)]
*  And they kind of have shown that a bunch of times, right? You're right about the Soleimani, [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8295.539999999999s)]
*  they didn't really strike back here, they didn't really strike back, et cetera. But we're saying, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8299.38s)]
*  but at the same time, they're so super sophisticated that they could have a nuclear bomb any second. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8303.3s)]
*  So I'm way more skeptical. But I do wanna go back to one other question that's important, [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8307.699999999999s)]
*  because I wanna know where your head's at. And a rough sense of where you think MAGA is, [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8312.74s)]
*  for loosely speaking, right? Where's the red line for you, Dan? [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8318.02s)]
*  So let's say that it had kept going, right? And Iran blocked the Strait of Hormuz and [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8324.34s)]
*  hit one of our ships and drone strikes on our troops and et cetera. And then we strike back. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8331.380000000001s)]
*  And then is there a point where you go, wait, this is too much war, we said anti-war, [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8337.54s)]
*  now we're knee deep in it? Sure, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't support a boots on the ground situation [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8343.46s)]
*  in that country no matter what happened. Because I know I've done it, and it doesn't work. There's [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8349.46s)]
*  no way that a bunch of white faces march into Tehran and change that situation ever. That will, [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8354.419999999998s)]
*  at no point in all of human history will that ever be effective. So it's a cost benefit analysis. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8360.099999999999s)]
*  Remember, in regard to the Strait of Hormuz, China's never gonna allow that to happen. They [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8365.619999999999s)]
*  would lose a lot of money. So it's just not gonna happen. But it's something I like to have the [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8369.94s)]
*  conversation on. I like to flush this all out because people have assumptions about this. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8375.86s)]
*  Like if you're an anti-war person or you're a neocon or this or that, no matter what you are, [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8381.380000000001s)]
*  if you don't actually have the conversation and say, here are the cards on this side and here are [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8387.7s)]
*  the cards on this side, here are the potential moves, strategy, et cetera, then we don't really [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8391.86s)]
*  know any of this stuff, right? People kind of shy away from this debate or they think it's [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8395.54s)]
*  adversarial to have the conversation and go through the paces of this. I don't think so. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8399.06s)]
*  And people seem to think that this specifically, I think to your point, is dividing MAGA. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8403.14s)]
*  I guess, I'm not really sure what people mean when they say MAGA, to be honest anymore, [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8408.42s)]
*  just like I'm not sure what people mean when they say Republican or Democrat. Those words are [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8412.019999999999s)]
*  completely meaningless to me now. I think people want the thing that they're a part of to be [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8416.5s)]
*  something and I'm not always sure that it is. I'm sure actually that it's not usually what it is. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8421.939999999999s)]
*  I'll settle for this anti-leftist coalition, I guess, or maybe that's not even the right way [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8426.34s)]
*  to put it, but this anti-woke coalition that voted for Trump or maybe against Kamala either way, [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8433.86s)]
*  the group that would or is right now probably and should probably fracture along some lines. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8440.66s)]
*  They don't agree on everything, nor should they because it's a very diverse coalition, [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8447.54s)]
*  but they agreed on a couple of things like public safety, keep your hands off our kids, [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8452.58s)]
*  we don't want new wars, protracted stuff like that. And I've said this in the past, [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8456.5s)]
*  but this new coalition, it rose to defeat an installed candidate that they felt was [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8460.18s)]
*  undemocratic and unjust, that's my opinion. And the illegal immigration stuff, they rose to defeat [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8466.34s)]
*  that as well. And it had nothing to do with the old right versus left stuff. I don't think it was [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8472.42s)]
*  about that. I mean, you could see from the polling that it wasn't about that. So this new coalition [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8477.7s)]
*  will probably fracture and grow into what may become the new left and the new right or parts [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8482.740000000002s)]
*  of the new left and the new right, whatever it happens to be. We're always going to have those [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8488.26s)]
*  two things. My hope is that the extremists on the right that are popping up now, these people that [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8491.380000000001s)]
*  think that Jews are the source of all the world's problems, these 8 million people, or that women [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8498.34s)]
*  are the worst because they couldn't get a date in high school, so now women have no value, this is [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8506.98s)]
*  absolute nonsense. Then the grifters who are making money on that. And then the pacifists, [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8511.06s)]
*  who I think are so rooted in this anti-war stuff that they can't see the need to prevent evil. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8515.859999999999s)]
*  I hope they all kind of go back to being quiet to some degree. Actually, the one that I would [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8522.26s)]
*  hang on to is the pacifists because I like that they drag us, or at least make people question [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8527.22s)]
*  the motive of going to war. I think that's a very useful thing. But the rest of these people that [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8531.46s)]
*  are just, I think, bad actors, I hope they go away and I hope that this new coalition [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8535.54s)]
*  splits off at some point, becomes a real right and a real left. And the people that went to [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8540.42s)]
*  the extremes maybe kind of come back a little bit and start talking to each other again. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8546.26s)]
*  Because otherwise, we don't really have a country anymore. We just have a bunch of people standing [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8549.94s)]
*  around yelling at each other. Yeah, so super last thing here, Dan. So I went on a progressive show [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8553.140000000001s)]
*  that I generally agree with. And we have a conversation just like this, hey, where's your [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8559.140000000001s)]
*  hand out these days? Where's my hand out these days? It kind of devolved into a debate. But [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8564.9s)]
*  Kyle Kalinsky said something that I want to run by you because I genuinely don't know what you're [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8569.94s)]
*  going to say about this. I mean, you partly answered it there, so you give me a little [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8573.859999999999s)]
*  bit better sense of it. But I think you've said some stuff that's the opposite on your show, [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8577.539999999999s)]
*  but I'm not sure. So let me run you this clip and then get your reaction to it. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8581.94s)]
*  The only people who are sincere that I will grant you, Cenk, is libertarians. So Thomas [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8585.3s)]
*  Massey and Dave Smith, because libertarians have a track record like Ron Paul did of being very [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8591.7s)]
*  principled. But everybody in MAGA, or 99% of them, will bend the knee, just like 99% [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8595.86s)]
*  of the ones in Congress have already bent the knee. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8601.140000000001s)]
*  So Dan, what's your reaction to that? [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8603.300000000001s)]
*  I mean, obviously, it's hyperbole. And that's all that guy does is speak in hyperbole, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8608.5s)]
*  and you can tell from his hair. But yeah, I think libertarians are sincere. They [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8613.7s)]
*  prioritize individual liberty above all else, and we need that guy around for sure. We need [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8618.74s)]
*  them advocating for the individual. That's what this country's all about. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8623.06s)]
*  I do think there are a lot of cultists in the MAGA thing. The people that are out there supporting [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8626.74s)]
*  the big, beautiful bill. 12 months ago, they were talking about how omnibus bills are bad, [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8631.86s)]
*  right? No question. And then you see these smaller fractures that happen. So Iran gets bombed, [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8637.06s)]
*  and Trump makes an offhanded comment about regime change. Now, that was for an audience of one. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8643.539999999999s)]
*  That was for the Ayatollah, right? To say, don't attack us because we will light you up. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8648.34s)]
*  And I think that's how Trump operates. Whether you think that's smart or not is not the question, [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8653.3s)]
*  but that's what happened. And a lot of people, instead of being adult human beings with brains [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8658.18s)]
*  that function properly and knew that Trump was playing the game there, said, yeah, regime change [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8665.06s)]
*  might be an option. What are you talking about? What are you Lindsey Graham? What are you talking [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8670.66s)]
*  about? You know what I mean? So your principles should not in any way rely on any other person. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8673.22s)]
*  Otherwise, they're not principles, right? Yeah. See, that's an interesting nuanced answer. That's [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8678.34s)]
*  what I expected from you, Dan. I didn't know which way you were gonna go, but I expected a nuance. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8683.460000000001s)]
*  So me, you and Kyle, all of us agreed libertarians were principled. They have an important role. We [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8686.9s)]
*  might not be libertarians, but we appreciate their role in this spectrum. And you agreed that there [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8692.5s)]
*  is some cultist in MAGA, and they shift along with whatever Trump says. I agree with that. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8699.380000000001s)]
*  Certainly, Kyle agrees with that. Where you and I split from Kyle is there's also people who are [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8704.42s)]
*  principled, and they have different principles, and they're not necessarily gonna go with everything [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8709.460000000001s)]
*  Trump says. But look, we're all gonna find out throughout these next four years. And so here, [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8715.460000000001s)]
*  you've clearly enunciated some things that you agree with on Trump and things that you disagree [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8721.7s)]
*  with. So listen, brother, I appreciate the conversation. And I appreciate that we have it [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8728.1s)]
*  in a level-headed way where you go, okay, I think this and you think that, and everybody gets to [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8734.34s)]
*  hear it out. So- Sure. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8738.66s)]
*  Thanks for- Yeah, if we weren't on TV, I'd probably swear a lot more, but that's just how I talk. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8740.1s)]
*  You know? Yeah, yeah, me too, brother, me too, believe me. But I've been on Drinking Bro's [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8743.7s)]
*  podcast, the Citizen Podcast, so you should check that out where we do curse more. All right, Dan, [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8750.1s)]
*  thanks for joining us again, appreciate it, brother. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8756.34s)]
*  Yes, sir, have a good night, man. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8758.1s)]
*  You too. All right, up next is Jesse Murl. He was also someone that I talked to. And we're [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8759.14s)]
*  gonna take a quick break, and we're gonna bring Jesse on, also a right-wing podcaster. Let's see [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8767.14s)]
*  what he has to say. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8771.54s)]
*  All right, we got another fun interview for you guys. Young Turks interviewed Jesse Murl [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8846.34s)]
*  before the election, right-wing podcaster, and we had a debate about whether it should be Trump [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8871.62s)]
*  or not. Want to check back in with him and see how that's going, and what do you think so far? [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8876.34s)]
*  Jesse on fire is his show. Jesse, welcome back, brother. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8881.62s)]
*  What's up, dude? I'm not right-wing, dude. I don't fall into categories. I'm just a person [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8885.7s)]
*  who says things on the internet. Okay, fair enough, but you voted for Trump, right? [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8890.740000000002s)]
*  I did vote for Trump, though, yeah. Yes. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8895.78s)]
*  Okay. So all right, Jesse, first, Rod, how do you think he's doing so far? [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8897.62s)]
*  I mean, honestly, for me, at any point, if you ask me how's leadership in the country doing, [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8905.86s)]
*  I would always tell you it's a mixed bag. I would say I feel like a thousand times more comfortable [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8913.62s)]
*  with the direction of the country than I did four years ago. I just think that, I mean, [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8918.18s)]
*  you have to ask. I feel like there's so much going on that to answer kind of high level is [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8924.5s)]
*  challenging because it's like, I mean, which part are we talking about? We just bombed another [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8930.26s)]
*  country, which I certainly didn't vote for. But I guess now you kind of look at what's the outcome [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8933.3s)]
*  going to be still to be determined if that's a good thing, bad thing. The immigration thing, [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8940.58s)]
*  I just heard today that he's talking about taking away birthright citizenship, which I definitely [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8944.98s)]
*  don't agree with. But I think overall, in terms of a lot of the things that are happening, [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8950.98s)]
*  I agree with. But I would say those are the two things that I would say I am challenged with [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8957.859999999999s)]
*  in the last, recently. Yeah, okay, that makes sense. And it is nuanced. There's things that [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8963.06s)]
*  I've agreed with on Trump. Like, for example, when he told Israel, bring the [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8968.9s)]
*  jets back, do not keep bombing Iran, I was like, okay, good, thank God. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8973.859999999999s)]
*  And so far, the ceasefire has helped, cross your fingers. But okay, let's talk about war, [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8978.98s)]
*  so that you mentioned that. I was definitely against him bombing Iran. Were you against it [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8984.02s)]
*  before he did it? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, and then he did something I didn't expect, which is that he [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8989.380000000001s)]
*  pulled back. And so we'll see if that holds. But what did you think of the pullback? [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=8997.220000000001s)]
*  So that's kind of my experience kind of watching him operate in the last, since he's been president, [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9003.14s)]
*  at least when it comes to international affairs, has been interesting. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9011.78s)]
*  Because it's like, I've recognized that he does have a plan in a lot of cases. And in order for [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9013.94s)]
*  him to be able to execute on the strategy that he's trying to put in motion, him and his inner [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9021.54s)]
*  circle need to be the only people that kind of know what's going on. I thought with the tariffs, [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9028.26s)]
*  I thought he'd lost his mind. And then it turned out that what ended up happening is he got these [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9032.1s)]
*  much better deals on our trade deals with a bunch of countries. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9038.34s)]
*  And then in this case, when he bombed Iran, that seemed incredibly reckless. But then when the [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9041.140000000001s)]
*  outcome ends up being a ceasefire and potentially Iran absent their ability to enrich uranium, [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9046.26s)]
*  I'm like, I mean, if this thing holds, he obviously knows what he was doing better than I did. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9053.78s)]
*  I mean, I still think that dropping bombs on any foreign country, especially one with a really [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9059.7s)]
*  strong military like Iran, at least strong for the region. I mean, you have to make some really, [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9064.66s)]
*  really ballsy calculations on what their responses are going to be. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9072.02s)]
*  And I mean, at least thus far, it seems to be working out if the ceasefire holds and they end [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9076.66s)]
*  up in a better spot without enrichment capabilities, it's probably gonna end up being a good thing. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9080.820000000002s)]
*  It's just to be determined, I think. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9085.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I agree with you. So look, I wouldn't have done the strikes [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9087.3s)]
*  under any circumstance because it involves risk and like not insignificant risk because, [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9091.539999999999s)]
*  what if they bomb one of our ships? My God, what if they're successful and they sink a ship? [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9097.14s)]
*  Then it's over. We're gonna go full bore into Iran and it's going to be an epic disaster, right? [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9101.38s)]
*  So I had those concerns, apparently you had those concerns. So let me ask you what your red line is, [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9107.06s)]
*  Jesse. So far, if it turns out this is all that happened and he gets the ceasefire in Iran and [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9113.14s)]
*  Israel, don't ever hit each other again. Gaza is a whole nother thing, right? But if he stopped that, [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9120.34s)]
*  I get it. I get people saying, hey, maybe it worked. Maybe destroy their facilities. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9126.42s)]
*  They didn't really hit us back and Iran and Israel are not in a war anymore. Okay, if, great. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9131.939999999999s)]
*  But if it doesn't go that way, you have a red line, is it boots on the ground? [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9138.42s)]
*  What else would happen where you go, no, no, no, this is not the anti-war thing that I signed up for. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9145.3s)]
*  That would be a big problem. If we started deploying troops, but I don't think he's gonna [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9151.38s)]
*  do that. But yeah, I mean, certainly if we started deploying troops in the Middle East, I would, [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9155.14s)]
*  there's, I'm not one of these guys that is gonna make my opinions based on which politician is [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9159.859999999999s)]
*  telling me what we're doing. I definitely do not think we should have troops on the ground. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9169.539999999999s)]
*  Say in a new war in the Middle East, not, yeah, that would be a big problem for me. But again, [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9174.26s)]
*  unless he did that, it's just kind of all hypotheticals. I just don't think he would [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9181.859999999999s)]
*  do that. But yeah, that would be certainly, I mean, I wouldn't even say that there's necessarily [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9187.78s)]
*  a red line that exists cuz I wouldn't have supported him bombing them in the first place. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9191.140000000001s)]
*  But apparently, he knew what he was doing. Did you see, by the way, did you see the video [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9196.18s)]
*  of those bunker busters that went straight down that ventilation pipe? I saw that yesterday and [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9201.460000000001s)]
*  I was like, at least at some point we could just like, let's just, everybody set everything aside [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9206.1s)]
*  and just marvel at what humans are capable of in terms of technological advancement. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9210.74s)]
*  It's unfortunate that we focus all that energy on just technology that destroys things as opposed [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9216.1s)]
*  to others, but pretty unbelievable. What? Yeah, the only thing that bothers me about that is, [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9220.34s)]
*  look, it's an incredible feat. They flew 36 hours straight, they refueled a couple of times. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9226.34s)]
*  And then they drop a ride down the shaft if that video is right. And so that's all amazing. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9231.7s)]
*  It's not like politicians taking credit for it. If it turns out that, hey, you [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9238.26s)]
*  destroy their uranium facility and they never go to war, okay, you could take credit for that. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9242.34s)]
*  But you didn't fly the plane, brother. Same thing with Obama when they killed Bin Laden. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9247.14s)]
*  I was like, what a courageous act. I'm like, really? Wouldn't every president say, yeah, [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9252.98s)]
*  go kill Bin Laden? Is there a president that would have said, no, don't kill Bin Laden? [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9258.5s)]
*  So in that case, actually, I think Obama had to make a really ballsy call. And only because [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9262.58s)]
*  that particular situation, I just have gotten sucked into a million rabbit holes of reading about [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9269.86s)]
*  the things that led up to it. And it's like, I mean, the level of intelligence that they had, [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9275.140000000001s)]
*  that it was going to be Osama Bin Laden was not even remotely close to what Obama would have felt [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9281.78s)]
*  comfortable acting on normally. And where the raid was so close to one of the main, [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9287.22s)]
*  it was almost like Instant America would be like, God, it's basically like a military academy was [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9295.22s)]
*  right there. And they have nukes, dude, Pakistan, we can't mess around with Pakistan. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9302.34s)]
*  And so it was a really ballsy call. I mean, I guess you could kind of say the same thing about [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9307.539999999999s)]
*  Trump doing these Iran strikes. But again, with the Obama one, it's like we have the benefit of [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9312.98s)]
*  hindsight. He was there. We didn't do some reckless attack on some random house in Pakistan that did [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9318.9s)]
*  not have Osama. And so I think I can just praise Obama as having made a really great call. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9325.699999999999s)]
*  In this case, we still don't know. Yeah, and they didn't have a nuclear weapon in Iran. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9332.74s)]
*  So that was another reason not to do it. But they were enriching uranium, [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9338.9s)]
*  it's a long story. But you were against it, I was against it, God. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9343.62s)]
*  So I wanna ask you a little bit more about Trump in a second, but I'm gonna play your clip here from, [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9347.460000000001s)]
*  so I went on a left-wing show and we were gonna have a conversation like this. Hey, [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9352.58s)]
*  where you at? Where am I at? And kind of a debate broke out, right? I'm not doing this like as a [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9357.14s)]
*  or anything, cuz I don't know what you're gonna say about it. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9363.619999999999s)]
*  So Kyle Klinsky is an old ally. We ground a great number of policy issues, I think almost [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9366.66s)]
*  all the policy issues. But he has a certain view and a lot of people on the left do of MAGA. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9373.46s)]
*  And you're an interesting cat because you're saying you're not even a right-wing [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9379.619999999999s)]
*  podcaster, right? And you just make it, but you did vote for Trump. So I just wanna run the clip [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9383.22s)]
*  and then get your view of how the right-wing sees it, because Kyle and I are not in the [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9387.779999999999s)]
*  right-wing, right? We didn't vote for Trump. So I'm curious what you make of this. Let's actually [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9392.42s)]
*  play the second clip of the hosts and the voters. Let's watch that. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9396.82s)]
*  You're saying it's all fake and you think that all these right-wing hosts are not actually anti-war, [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9402.1s)]
*  that this is, but they've been telling their audience now for months that the war is a terrible. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9409.22s)]
*  Let me ask the question. And that the war is a terrible, terrible, terrible idea. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9414.58s)]
*  And how would that strategy work? So they get their audience totally against the war, [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9419.779999999999s)]
*  then they capitulate to Trump. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9424.5s)]
*  Let me tell you how that strategy works. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9426.1s)]
*  And how did that help them be pro-war? [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9427.619999999999s)]
*  Let me explain how that strategy works. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9429.619999999999s)]
*  My answer to your question is yes, by the way. In 99% of cases, they are just [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9432.34s)]
*  lying and they'll go and suck Trump off again. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9435.699999999999s)]
*  So let me- [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9437.939999999999s)]
*  That's a real disagreement. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9438.58s)]
*  They postured as anti-war because they thought it was a good electoral strategy. So now they have [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9439.779999999999s)]
*  some track record late of claiming that Trump is a pro-peace candidate, blah, blah, blah. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9444.26s)]
*  And why was it a good strategy? Is there voters are anti-war? [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9448.18s)]
*  Okay, we'll come back to that. Okay, the polling is wildly at odds with the exchange on that. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9452.5s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9457.380000000001s)]
*  Okay, again, I'm not trying to pick fights here or anything like that. It's Kalkulinski [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9459.06s)]
*  and Crystal Ball. And again, I agree with them on policy, an overwhelming amount. But [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9463.06s)]
*  I'm curious your take on that. So there's the host and Kyle says, no, 99% of them aren't really [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9468.9s)]
*  anti-war. And then there's the voters and that's where Crystal said, no, they're not [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9475.38s)]
*  going to disagree with Trump. So what's your sense? [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9482.74s)]
*  What? Okay, so it's so funny that you picked those two because I spent a fair amount of time. I mean, [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9485.3s)]
*  if someone wanted to look at my channel and be like, well, what evidence is there that this [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9492.099999999999s)]
*  guy's hardcore mago? Well, he certainly shits on Kalkulinski sometimes. Sorry, I was not supposed [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9495.619999999999s)]
*  to swear. That's my fault, you guys. But I mean, Kalkulinski on X looks like a psycho. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9501.3s)]
*  He looks like an unhinged person who is totally incapable of looking at things through [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9507.939999999999s)]
*  any kind of lens that is not. I mean, everyone's lying. So everyone, everyone who says, [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9513.46s)]
*  I don't want to bomb children in the Middle East or I don't want us spending our tax dollars to [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9521.3s)]
*  kill people in the Middle East. All of us, it's a big phony joke because exactly the point you made. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9527.38s)]
*  It's like, what's the strategy there, guy? What possible reason would that be? And it's like, [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9535.619999999999s)]
*  there is a level of mind twist that people can get to where they genuinely just [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9541.619999999999s)]
*  will apply malice to everything when there is a group over here in this, [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9550.259999999998s)]
*  like, I don't even know how to even put myself in there because it's the exact opposite of how I [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9555.3s)]
*  think. It's like the best example of that is always in the abortion issue, in my opinion. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9561.46s)]
*  It's like you have this side over here who is anti-abortion and they genuinely believe that they [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9566.9s)]
*  are trying to save the lives of babies. And they look at this group over here and they're like, [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9572.66s)]
*  they want to murder babies because whatever. And then this over here, they're like, they want to [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9578.66s)]
*  control my body. It's like, dude, this one doesn't want to get forced into having a child when she's [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9584.34s)]
*  17 years old when she has plans to get her master's degree and go do a bunch of stuff. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9589.7s)]
*  Why are you going to force her to have the kid? And you guys, you think you want to control your [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9593.7s)]
*  body? They don't want dead babies. So that's what I'm saying is if you can't, if you're [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9598.26s)]
*  too blinded to be able to see the opposing sides like a human. This is like Kyle Kalinsky and [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9604.82s)]
*  Crystal Ball are like the most furthest example of that I could possibly imagine. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9612.02s)]
*  What are they talking about? Why would anyone lie about being anti-war? [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9618.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's so interesting because I wouldn't have picked them as the most out there. I think [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9621.54s)]
*  there's a lot of people that are further out than Crystal and Kyle in terms of hating MAGA and [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9626.82s)]
*  not believing them and stuff. And I didn't know that you thought that about Kyle, but [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9633.140000000001s)]
*  that's interesting because I mean, Kyle and I both agree he shouldn't have dropped a bomb [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9637.94s)]
*  apparently you agree that he shouldn't have dropped a bomb. Kyle and I and Crystal and I [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9641.54s)]
*  probably agree like I said, I don't know 95% of issues. So but you don't view me and him [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9646.34s)]
*  in the same way. So that's I didn't expect that. So that's interesting. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9651.94s)]
*  So since Kyle and I have very similar policy stances, why don't you view us the same way? [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9656.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's I can give you that immediately. Okay, so it's because I can tell when people have slipped [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9663.859999999999s)]
*  into the this is some kind of us first them game and then they're incapable of looking at [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9671.46s)]
*  things objectively. So like, as an example, when this guy in Minnesota went and shot those lawmakers, [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9677.619999999999s)]
*  right? Whatever guy and there's this big dispute it's all, is this guy MAGA terrorist or is he a [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9683.38s)]
*  Democrat? And it's like, he's neither he's a crazy person. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9690.1s)]
*  Okay, like it doesn't matter what his politics are. If you go and look at [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9694.74s)]
*  Calcolitski's ex account throughout that thing, he was like, Mr. He had to be right that this guy was [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9698.82s)]
*  a MAGA guy, even when it turned out that this guy had been appointed to a four year work development [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9706.66s)]
*  force by Tim Walz personally, and then his wife worked for Tim Walz. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9713.46s)]
*  It's like, and to be clear, I'm not trying to make you take credit for I'm saying he's a crazy [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9718.58s)]
*  person, but he's definitely not MAGA. And then just go look like he actually put a post up after [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9723.14s)]
*  that information came out trying to convince his user that still, even though that was out there, [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9728.9s)]
*  don't let these MAGA people confuse you. He is a MAGA right wing lunatic and you're like, [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9734.9s)]
*  that's embarrassing guy. You want to die on that hill dude? [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9740.26s)]
*  So that's very interesting because I actually, I agree with both of you guys. I agree with Kyle [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9745.22s)]
*  that he's far more likely to be MAGA. But I agree with you that it doesn't really matter. They're [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9750.18s)]
*  all nuts. Like Muslim fundamentalists, the Jewish fundamentalists who killed Yitzhak Rabin, [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9754.74s)]
*  they're all crazy. They're crazy people. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9762.34s)]
*  Yeah, they're not mentally well. No one who's mentally well goes and kills other people and [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9764.42s)]
*  goes to jail for the rest of their lives. Right? And the mass shooters, they don't have any [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9769.54s)]
*  political ideology except the mass shooters who do and leave behind a treatise. So one of us [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9773.86s)]
*  about insurance that was a mass shooter, but a CEO shooter, and then you got the ones about race, [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9779.220000000001s)]
*  etc. Anyway, all right, last thing here, Jesse. Give me one or two things if you have them outside [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9783.54s)]
*  of war where you've thought, I wish Trump hadn't done that. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9791.86s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I would say the application of the kind of crackdown on immigration, [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9799.220000000001s)]
*  that's a big one for me. I mean, so just since we talked about this earlier, the birthright citizenship, [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9808.18s)]
*  like the issues that I tend to have a strong opinion on are ones that I have looked at [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9814.82s)]
*  personally in my own life and been like, that's wrong. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9822.34s)]
*  If this is going to be the way that what you're proposing is applied to this family right here, [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9825.14s)]
*  then I know very well, I know their situation. That's wrong. I mean, it's just bottom line. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9830.02s)]
*  And like the birthright citizenship thing, so because I'm heavy in Jiu-Jitsu, and so I know [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9834.74s)]
*  a lot of Brazilians who are here on work visas, green cards, or have got against that citizenship. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9840.98s)]
*  So I know more about that actual process than a lot of people, which probably kind of helps shape [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9850.34s)]
*  my opinion on the entire thing. But if you're telling me that a person who has done the paperwork [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9855.86s)]
*  is here legally on visas or on a green card, they have a job, they pay their taxes. They have a child, [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9862.66s)]
*  that child should not be a citizen of the United States. That makes no sense to me at all. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9869.46s)]
*  It's like, well, so where should they be a citizen? They're like a person that just doesn't get [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9873.699999999999s)]
*  citizenship. That doesn't make sense. My whole thing is like, on the flip side of the immigration [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9879.22s)]
*  thing, I also am looking at people who are doing immigration correctly. They file their paperwork, [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9884.82s)]
*  they know they have until this date to be here, then they have to update it, they have to go do [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9891.3s)]
*  it, and they're doing all of those things. And so I don't understand the argument against that. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9894.9s)]
*  It's like if people are not, I mean, we have rules. If you wanna change the rules, change the rules. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9901.06s)]
*  But the rules state you have to do this, this, and this. And if they're not doing that, they snuck in, [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9906.18s)]
*  they're not doing that, whatever. The idea that it's inhumane for us to enforce laws that are [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9909.779999999999s)]
*  already there doesn't make a lot of sense to me. That said, there's also a matter of allocation of [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9916.42s)]
*  resources and optics and just like, how does it make me feel? And when we're going after gang [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9924.26s)]
*  members, people with criminal records, people who might be terrorists who came over when they weren't [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9929.54s)]
*  vetting anybody, it's like, dude, release the hounds on those guys and drag them out by their [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9932.9s)]
*  hair. I don't care about that at all. But when I started seeing videos of them going into like, [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9938.02s)]
*  I don't know, places where, bottom line, if someone's here and they're working and they've [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9946.34s)]
*  been working for years and you raid those places, to me, here's exactly what I would do. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9949.94s)]
*  Is instead of raiding and then deporting, I would send people there and the first meeting would be [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9956.58s)]
*  to educate them on how they get up to date on their paperwork. And then you give them two weeks, [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9961.460000000001s)]
*  three weeks, however long it is. And if they're not up to date on their paperwork, when you come [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9965.94s)]
*  back, then you deport them. Educate them, teach them how they're supposed to do this legally [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9969.300000000001s)]
*  so that they can get within the, get legal. And then if they still don't do it, ship them. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9974.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, so last thing here. So today we had a story that's similar to [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9980.42s)]
*  one of the things that you were complaining about, which is there was a woman who went to [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9986.1s)]
*  her asylum hearing. She was doing all the paperwork right and she had gotten [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9992.98s)]
*  paroled into the country and then she has a six-year-old. Turns out the six-year-old has [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=9997.22s)]
*  leukemia. So they snatch her up from the hearing and then the kid wets himself and they won't let [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10001.7s)]
*  him change it and he can't get leukemia. What are we doing here? And so then people aren't [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10008.66s)]
*  going to go to asylum hearings, right? People aren't going to- [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10015.460000000001s)]
*  All right, yeah, that particular issue I have specific insight on because, [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10018.18s)]
*  wow, how specific. Someone very high in Homeland Security is a person who's a friend of mine and [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10025.54s)]
*  they actually talked to me about this particular issue and it was like, he's like, I mean, he's a [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10030.42s)]
*  Trump voter too, but he's like, I think that there are some things that are being done that are kind [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10037.460000000001s)]
*  of on the margins. And one of them was that it's not just that they were going and [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10042.1s)]
*  snatching them up at the hearings. They were actually canceling their appointments and not [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10046.98s)]
*  telling them. So they were canceling the appointment, they wouldn't tell them, [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10051.94s)]
*  so they would show up and the whole purpose of this thing is to give them the, give the [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10055.38s)]
*  attention to know where to get them, which is absurd to me because you're snatching up the [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10063.46s)]
*  people who are trying to do the right thing. That's my whole thing is like, if they are [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10068.339999999998s)]
*  trying to do things right, allow them to do things right. If they're trying to skirt the system, [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10071.46s)]
*  then round them up and ship them. But the thing with the trial, that makes no sense to me at all. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10076.339999999998s)]
*  They're trying to do the right thing, let them try to do the right thing. You think that MS-13 [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10080.66s)]
*  is coming to their appointment, they're not coming, you know what I mean? [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10085.38s)]
*  I just say I never heard it that way. That's a really good point. Here's who's not coming [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10088.5s)]
*  to their asylum hearing, MS-13. Definitely. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10093.539999999999s)]
*  Right. So okay, then super last thing is, well, I was gonna finish that thought with, [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10096.66s)]
*  Rogan said this and I'm curious if you kind of agree with it. He said, look, I think a lot of [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10103.46s)]
*  people voted for close the border and send home the undocumented immigrants who are criminals, [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10108.74s)]
*  got convicted of a crime, gone. We don't want them, right? [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10115.94s)]
*  But if you go into the middle of the country and you start going to Home Depots and restaurants and [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10119.22s)]
*  factories and stuff and people have been here 10 years, 20 years, they're with their kids and you [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10124.58s)]
*  start taking them out, people are gonna find it cruel. And he's like, I'm out, I don't want that. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10128.18s)]
*  And I think a lot of people don't want that. And so do you think Rogan's kind of got it right [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10133.3s)]
*  for what people voted for and didn't vote for? Yeah, I'm aligned with him on that. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10138.58s)]
*  And, but just for the record, we're spending a lot of time about me kind of going, okay, [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10143.38s)]
*  here's where I would push back on Trump. But to be clear on this particular issue, [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10148.02s)]
*  I'll tell you the best way to ensure that you're going to have people signing off on [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10152.1s)]
*  what could have potentially been seen as like inhumane type of immigration stuff. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10159.14s)]
*  It's like, all you have to do is just go start a riot in LA. Give the visual of the pushback [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10163.22s)]
*  against this are burn cop cars again. Because the whole thing is like, just do it the right way. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10171.06s)]
*  If you're making an attempt to do it the right way, then as far as I'm concerned, [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10179.699999999999s)]
*  we should allow them to do the right thing. But throwing a temper tantrum and burning police cars [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10183.699999999999s)]
*  is the fastest way to lose me in one second, where I'm like, all right. I mean, if this is [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10188.5s)]
*  the face of your guys' opposition to this, I'm not going to help you. You know what I mean? [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10192.98s)]
*  But at the same time, I realize how idiotic that is. So I can catch myself in those thoughts. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10197.14s)]
*  Most people can't. And so they'll start being like, grab them. And they think that when they're, [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10202.1s)]
*  they're not really thinking it through. And you're like, okay, but that's kind of like, [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10208.26s)]
*  I mean, are you sure that's really what you want to do? [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10212.42s)]
*  And the way that they think about it is they're like, did you see what they did in LA? Just who [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10214.74s)]
*  cares? And it's like, I mean, I understand that way of thinking. I have to kind of catch myself [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10219.78s)]
*  to not do that personally. But- [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10224.26s)]
*  Yeah, no, I get that, Jesse. Because look, I said in the coverage, I don't think they should [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10226.1s)]
*  have come in and done what they did, ICE. I don't think that they should have fired into the crowd [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10232.42s)]
*  with the flashbang grenades. I don't think they should bring the Marines in. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10237.54s)]
*  But don't burn the way most. Don't burn American flags, are you nuts? That's gonna make people [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10241.300000000001s)]
*  not like you. And when you burn the American flag and you bring the Mexican flags only, [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10245.7s)]
*  then it sets people up to go, well, okay, then go back, right? [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10251.94s)]
*  Did you see- [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10255.220000000001s)]
*  So it just hurts our side. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10257.140000000001s)]
*  Yes, exactly. Did you see that vice mayor? I don't remember, it's like one of those areas in LA [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10259.300000000001s)]
*  who asked Florencia 13 and the 18th Street gang why they're not attacking ICE. And I thought [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10265.62s)]
*  you're about protecting your territory. I was like, she needs to go to jail. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10274.66s)]
*  He's in her to jail. That's insane. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10279.38s)]
*  Yeah, she made me want to pull my hair out. Don't ask the gangs to show up to protest. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10281.38s)]
*  I mean, just have some common sense. That doesn't help anybody. It doesn't help [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10287.86s)]
*  the undocumented immigrants who are just trying to work for a living and do the right things, [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10291.22s)]
*  as you were saying, etc. All right, I want to give people the proper context. I said last [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10295.78s)]
*  thing a couple of times, but I've asked you to criticize Trump on the things that you don't [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10300.1s)]
*  agree with, but you made a good point there. So tell me something you really like about Trump [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10305.460000000001s)]
*  and what he's done so far. Man, you want to know what I love that he does is, [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10309.94s)]
*  if everybody would just set down whatever they think that they know about him and just allow him [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10316.9s)]
*  to do the thing where we all collectively celebrate the United States, where he's trying [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10324.58s)]
*  to do the United States birthday and all that stuff and then do these events. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10328.9s)]
*  That stuff really matters. That stuff really matters. If everybody would just be able to [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10332.98s)]
*  get aligned and go 4th of July, we're all United States. Oh my God, that was Kyle Kalinsky. I [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10338.18s)]
*  forgot about that. Kyle Kalinsky posted on his Instagram that on 4th of July, he's going to be [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10343.38s)]
*  going to the no kings protest part two. And I was like, dude, you geek, okay? When do you get [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10349.779999999999s)]
*  an American flag and go to a barbecue guy on 4th of July? Okay, I'm not talking about it's [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10356.5s)]
*  unpatriotic. I'm like, do you think that you're going to be recruiting anybody who's cool if [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10362.5s)]
*  your tagline is like, we need to protest on 4th of July? You're like, get out of here, guy. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10367.7s)]
*  Just stop being such a nerd. But in terms of what Trump's done, get in there. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10373.14s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, right? [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10377.619999999999s)]
*  And now I don't know if I agree with you on that. Okay, so listen, here's what I was saying. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10378.58s)]
*  So I think the no kings protests were good. Nothing bad happened. There was just Americans [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10385.06s)]
*  showing up to say- Nothing bad. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10389.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. No, no, like at the LA one, the way Moe's got burned. That's bad, right? [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10392.26s)]
*  That's a completely different thing. Yeah. And no kings protest, nothing got burned. There was [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10396.9s)]
*  no property damage. It was just Americans expressing their point of view. If you want [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10400.66s)]
*  to do it on 4th of July, I could see that being patriotic in some way. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10404.42s)]
*  The only thing I would say is, I don't know if I'm gonna find a middle ground between you guys, [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10407.78s)]
*  and I don't need to. But if you're going to go to a protest on 4th of July, please bring your [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10411.06s)]
*  American flag, right? There you go. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10416.18s)]
*  Right? Because then you say, hey, listen, I love America and I want to help make it better, right? [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10420.1s)]
*  And the way you make it better is by coming to protests like this and saying, [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10428.1s)]
*  hey, I'm not in favor of this and I'm not in favor of that. I'm in favor of this. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10431.22s)]
*  But I'm in favor of this because I love America and I brought the flag. And so look, [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10434.66s)]
*  I think that that plays better for the whole country. And at least, I mean, let me put it [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10438.82s)]
*  this way, Jesse, because I didn't think you were to say that. But would you at least- [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10445.22s)]
*  I have something else that's actually about Trump, but go ahead, sorry. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10449.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's okay. Would you hear them out more if they brought the flags? [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10452.5s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. I mean, if they're burning flags versus waving flags around, [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10457.939999999999s)]
*  it's like they're waving flags around. I'm like, all right, so we just disagree on [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10461.779999999999s)]
*  what the word tyranny means and what fascism means and your opinion on Trump. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10465.939999999999s)]
*  It's like, but at least, we're all aligned that America's a good spot that you should be proud [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10470.02s)]
*  that you're a citizen of. So one thing that Trump did recently actually that I would, again, [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10475.14s)]
*  is actually related to the Iran bombings, which we've obviously discussed, I was not in favor of. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10480.26s)]
*  But apparently, so he deregulated the energy markets in the Midwest, [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10484.58s)]
*  like within the last couple months. And that kind of, I didn't even see it until after he [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10490.9s)]
*  bombed Iran and they started threatening energy, what's the name, the Strait of- [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10497.3s)]
*  Strait of Hormuz? [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10503.46s)]
*  Whatever, but they were gonna put 20% of the oil, global oil distribution in jeopardy. And [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10504.82s)]
*  that's what someone was like, that's probably why he did the deregulation in the Midwest a couple [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10513.539999999999s)]
*  months ago in preparation. He knew he was gonna do this and I was like, man, that's a strong move [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10517.699999999999s)]
*  right there. If he knew, if it's because, listen, Israel starts bombing Iran out of nowhere and then [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10522.74s)]
*  we do this strike. And the idea that was not coordinated between our two countries is absurd. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10529.46s)]
*  Which means that he probably did the deregulation in preparation for them threatening our oil supply, [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10534.66s)]
*  which is pretty sharp. The guy knows, I mean, he knows what he's doing. He's executing a plan, [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10540.9s)]
*  we'll find out. He still isn't even, I think once he's six months in, so we got a long time. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10544.9s)]
*  We'll be able to give him a really good, great report card within a few years. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10550.02s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be super surprised if he did that deregulation based on the bombing. But hey, [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10556.74s)]
*  I asked you to say something positive about Trump, you said it. So is some things you like, [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10562.98s)]
*  some things you don't like. Hey, you're a person with- [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10569.06s)]
*  But I like him a lot. Overall, I like him a lot. He's hilarious. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10571.859999999999s)]
*  That's so interesting. You think he's funny and he loves America and those are two things you love [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10576.66s)]
*  about him. Totally, and no, listen, and I watched people, I watched a guy on unredacted that they [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10581.3s)]
*  had on who was talking about, specifically he was talking about the Iran bombings and he clearly [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10588.9s)]
*  had much more background than I did. I think he might have been a former weapons inspector [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10594.1s)]
*  and so I'm listening to his take, still trying to kind of like, I don't know, take this information [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10598.74s)]
*  in and process of what do I think about what just happened? And he's saying, oh, they did this, [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10604.82s)]
*  this, this, this, and then afterwards, he goes, he's like, well, and we all know that Trump is [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10609.54s)]
*  incapable of doing anything that's not about Donald Trump. He doesn't care about America. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10616.58s)]
*  He doesn't care about peace. He doesn't care about, he only cares about Donald Trump and I'm like, [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10620.74s)]
*  is that really how these people see him? It's bananas to me. It's like, [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10625.38s)]
*  because I know so many people who know him personally, like because I'm like, [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10629.539999999999s)]
*  UFC circles and so like you know him, they've like spent a lot of time with him and all of them are [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10634.26s)]
*  like, these people have the most backwards, bizarre view of what he's actually like. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10638.82s)]
*  And then Bill Maher went to dinner with him. Bill Maher hated Donald Trump and he couldn't even [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10644.26s)]
*  help it. He got back, he's all, listen, man, I had a really good time with him. He's not how I expected. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10648.42s)]
*  See, that's why I have these conversations. I could debate some of that and all the things [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10653.38s)]
*  you said that were positive about Trump, etc. But that's not the point. The point is, [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10658.1s)]
*  whether I talk to Kyle and Crystal or you and Dan Holloway, I'm getting your perspective. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10662.42s)]
*  And I find it super interesting that you really like him as a person, you like that he loves the [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10667.7s)]
*  country, but you have issues with some of the things that he's doing. Okay, that's whether I [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10672.18s)]
*  agree or disagree, it's an interesting perspective. So thanks for sharing it, brother. I appreciate it. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10677.38s)]
*  And if you watch Jesse on Fire, it's not just about politics, he also talks about [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10682.42s)]
*  culture and combat sports, as you might be able to tell from what he said. So check him out on [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10686.58s)]
*  Jesse on Fire and thanks for joining us, brother, I appreciate it. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10691.78s)]
*  Appreciate you, my dude. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10694.74s)]
*  All right. All right. Bring the country together one conversation at a time, [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10696.18s)]
*  or sometimes driving things apart. But we're trying. Okay, much love, we'll see you next time. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10702.18s)]
*  Bye. [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfj4CEiRmWU&t=10712.42s)]
