TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Judge BLOCKS Elon Musk's DOGE From Social Security Data
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw)
*  the biggest Ponzi scheme of all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=0.0s)]
*  time. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=2.4s)]
*  Well, explain that. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=3.14s)]
*  Well, the biggest Ponzi scheme of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=4.82s)]
*  all time just secured a pretty [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=7.32s)]
*  huge win against Elon Musk and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=9.58s)]
*  the Department of Government [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=11.8s)]
*  efficiency because a federal court [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=14.14s)]
*  has weighed in on whether Doge [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=16.76s)]
*  should be able to access private [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=18.86s)]
*  data, private information of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=21.1s)]
*  the Americans who are part of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=23.18s)]
*  the Social Security Administration's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=25.12s)]
*  database, and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=27.86s)]
*  this judge is basically saying no. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=29.46s)]
*  Your reasoning for wanting to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=32.18s)]
*  access this information doesn't [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=34.18s)]
*  make sense, I'm not buying it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=36.58s)]
*  And by the way, that information [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=39.02s)]
*  includes social security numbers, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=42.02s)]
*  medical, health records. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=45.18s)]
*  So that's a little bit problematic [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  when you have randos who were [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=50.14s)]
*  chosen by Elon Musk to be Doge [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=52.14s)]
*  associates accessing this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  information. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=56.14s)]
*  You also have bank data that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=56.94s)]
*  contains bank data, earnings [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=58.62s)]
*  history and more. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  So the order specifically blocks [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=61.14s)]
*  the Social Security Administration [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=63.3s)]
*  Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=66.1s)]
*  Chief Information Officer Michael [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=69.14s)]
*  Russo and all other SSA agents, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=71.94s)]
*  Social Security Administration [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=74.66s)]
*  agents and employees from granting [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  access to members of Doge to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=80.38s)]
*  basically have access to all that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=82.5s)]
*  private data of Americans who [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=85.18s)]
*  are in the US District Judge Ellen [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  Hollander in Maryland also requires [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  the team to delete any personally [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  identifiable data they may have. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=95.14s)]
*  It comes after labor unions and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  retirees asked for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=99.66s)]
*  an emergency order limiting Doge [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=101.06s)]
*  access to the agency and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=103.34s)]
*  its vast troves of personal data. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  And if you can notice, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  there's more than two dozen [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=108.62s)]
*  lawsuits playing out in the courts [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=110.14s)]
*  right now in order to challenge [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=111.94s)]
*  the Trump administration what [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=113.58s)]
*  they're up to. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=115.18s)]
*  And I want to be clear, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=115.9s)]
*  we're not talking about [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  a Democratic member of Congress [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  that filed the lawsuit in order to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  fight back, okay? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  Congress isn't fighting back in any [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=123.14s)]
*  way, shape or form. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  The Democrats have totally bowed [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=127.06s)]
*  their heads. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=129.46s)]
*  They're raising a ton of money. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=130.98s)]
*  Okay, I just read a piece in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=132.54s)]
*  the Hill about how Democrats had [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=134.26s)]
*  a nice little fundraising hall in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=136.46s)]
*  February, $11 million, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=138.66s)]
*  absolutely pathetic. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=140.62s)]
*  They're so embarrassing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=142.14s)]
*  But in this case, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=143.62s)]
*  you have labor unions and retirees [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=144.5s)]
*  getting active, filing a lawsuit, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=146.42s)]
*  in order to protect their private [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=148.78s)]
*  information from these Doge [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=151.1s)]
*  associates. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=153.14s)]
*  So the labor union said that Doge's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=154.62s)]
*  nearly unlimited access was in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=156.82s)]
*  violation of privacy laws, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=158.82s)]
*  for good reason. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=160.54s)]
*  I mean, we are talking about [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=161.74s)]
*  medical records in this case as [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=163.22s)]
*  well. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  Judge Hollander also didn't buy [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=165.38s)]
*  that members of Doge absolutely [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=167.34s)]
*  needed that access to all that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=169.26s)]
*  personal private information in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=170.98s)]
*  order to find waste, fraud, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=172.98s)]
*  and abuse. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=174.7s)]
*  So here's what the judge said. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=175.82s)]
*  Its method of doing so is tantamount [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=177.54s)]
*  to hitting a fly with [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=179.94s)]
*  a sledgehammer. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=181.34s)]
*  The Doge team is essentially [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  engaged in a phishing expedition at [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=184.7s)]
*  the Social Security Administration [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  in search of a fraud epidemic based [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=189.5s)]
*  on little more than suspicion. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=191.85999999999999s)]
*  It has launched a search for [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=194.1s)]
*  the proverbial needle in a haystack [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  without any concrete knowledge that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=199.14s)]
*  the needle is actually in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=201.98s)]
*  the haystack. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=203.78s)]
*  She also said that the government [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=205.46s)]
*  has not even attempted to explain [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=207.7s)]
*  why Doge needs such sweeping access [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=210.1s)]
*  to Americans' personal data, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=212.66s)]
*  instead repeating its refrain that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=215.06s)]
*  Doge's mission to root out fraud [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=217.9s)]
*  and modernize the bureaucracy must [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  not be hindered. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=223.1s)]
*  Now the judge also called out how [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=224.86s)]
*  important privacy clearly is for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=227.18s)]
*  members of the Doge team. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=229.66s)]
*  We don't even know their names. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=232.38s)]
*  So clearly, they really care about [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=234.1s)]
*  their own personal privacy, but [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=236.42s)]
*  they have absolutely no respect for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=238.66s)]
*  the privacy of American citizens. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  And that includes their health [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  records, their social security [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=245.38s)]
*  numbers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=247.14s)]
*  The judge says, ironically, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=247.66s)]
*  the identity of these Doge [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=249.26s)]
*  affiliates has been concealed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=250.66s)]
*  because defendants are concerned [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=252.38s)]
*  that the disclosure of even their [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=254.42s)]
*  names would expose them to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=256.54s)]
*  harassment and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  thus invade their privacy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  The defense does not appear to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=261.86s)]
*  be a privacy concern for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=263.78s)]
*  the millions of Americans whose [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=265.3s)]
*  Social Security Administration [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=267.3s)]
*  records were made available to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=269.46s)]
*  the Doge affiliates without their [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=271.5s)]
*  consent. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=273.86s)]
*  So what happens now? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=274.46s)]
*  Well, basically, the judge has [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  directed Trump's DOJ lawyers to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=278.06s)]
*  provide her with some legitimate [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=280.38s)]
*  explanation as to why they need [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=282.78s)]
*  just widespread broad access to all [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=285.02s)]
*  of this private information. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=287.62s)]
*  And Hollander's order does not [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=290.78s)]
*  preclude the Social Security [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=292.66s)]
*  Administration from providing Doge [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=294.42s)]
*  with redacted or anonymized data. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=296.74s)]
*  However, to receive that data, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=299.14s)]
*  Doge's agents must receive all [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=301.3s)]
*  training typically required of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=303.46s)]
*  individuals granted access to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=305.62s)]
*  Social Security Administration's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=307.66s)]
*  data systems, including on the laws [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=310.22s)]
*  and regulations governing privacy, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=312.9s)]
*  she said. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=315.7s)]
*  So an unelected person doesn't just [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=316.7s)]
*  get to come in, tap a bunch of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=319.26s)]
*  random people who we don't even [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=321.5s)]
*  know the names of, and without [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=323.86s)]
*  training, without any process, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=326.14000000000004s)]
*  have them access all of this [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=328.62s)]
*  private information and data [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  belonging to the American people. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=332.26s)]
*  That's the point that's being made [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=334.58000000000004s)]
*  here. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  So at least there's a little bit of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=336.98s)]
*  a win in a pretty horrific news day. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=339.06s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=343.54s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPderqzIoAw&t=344.98s)]
