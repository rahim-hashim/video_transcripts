# The View CRASHES OUT Over Biden Expose
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w)
*  I've known Joe 30, 40 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=0.0s)]
*  He doesn't always say the right thing the right way, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=3.84s)]
*  but he gets stuff done. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm interested in. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=9.36s)]
*  I don't care how old you are. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=10.8s)]
*  I don't care if you can't put two sentences together. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=12.0s)]
*  I don't care if he's pooped his pants. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=14.64s)]
*  I don't care if he can't put a sentence together. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=19.92s)]
*  Show me he can't do the job, and then I'll say, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=24.48s)]
*  OK, maybe it's time to go. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  So offensive to me is there's difference between age and intelligence. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=29.6s)]
*  The problem with this country is that we don't value people with their wisdom. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=33.92s)]
*  We don't value seniors. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=37.84s)]
*  When is Jake Tapper going to write a book about the cognitive decline [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=39.28s)]
*  of the person who is in charge right now? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=43.72s)]
*  If you're telling me that hundreds of people knew that he was not able to do his job, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  then where the hell was everybody? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=51.72s)]
*  Why is this important to know now? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=53.96s)]
*  Remember, poll after poll leading up to the 2024 presidential election [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=55.56s)]
*  indicated that the majority of voters, including the majority of Democratic voters, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=60.0s)]
*  were worried about Biden's age. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=65.04s)]
*  But the party ignored those polls and moved forward with Biden anyway. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  Before they loved Jake Tapper. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  When Jake Tapper was looking down his nose at anyone who suggested Biden was too old, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  the view loved him and they're like, what a great journalist. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=77.56s)]
*  But now that he's actually reporting things that are true, they're like, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  yuck, things that are true. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijz6x_VE0_w&t=83.68s)]
