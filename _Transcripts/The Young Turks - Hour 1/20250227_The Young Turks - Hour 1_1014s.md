# What's In Trump's "The Epstein Files: Phase 1"
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4)
*  You said last week that you have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=0.0s)]
*  the Epstein files on your desk. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=1.74s)]
*  When can we see them and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=3.56s)]
*  what's taking so [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=4.9s)]
*  long to release them? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=5.88s)]
*  I do, Jesse, there are well over [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  this, this will make you sick 200 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=10.44s)]
*  victims, we have to make sure that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=13.38s)]
*  their identity is protected. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=16.22s)]
*  Other than that, I think tomorrow [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=18.8s)]
*  Jesse, breaking news right now, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=20.84s)]
*  you're going to see some Epstein [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=22.78s)]
*  information being released by [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=24.6s)]
*  my office. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=26.32s)]
*  Well, it's tomorrow and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=26.92s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi last [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=29.0s)]
*  night promised while speaking to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=31.860000000000003s)]
*  Jesse Waters that she would be [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=34.64s)]
*  releasing the Epstein files, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=37.2s)]
*  the long awaited Epstein files. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=39.84s)]
*  But now she's facing some backlash [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=42.56s)]
*  from fellow Republicans for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=44.56s)]
*  failing to deliver the goods, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=46.32000000000001s)]
*  Cenk. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=48.2s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=48.74s)]
*  So to me, the most important and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=49.44s)]
*  interesting question is, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=51.2s)]
*  why are they not releasing [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=52.64s)]
*  the Epstein files? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=53.96s)]
*  I have two very plausible [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=55.08s)]
*  explanations, one of them is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=56.64s)]
*  a little dangerous. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=58.44s)]
*  So we'll get to that in a minute, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=60.16s)]
*  but first, the great disappointment, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=61.72s)]
*  including by the right wing, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=63.6s)]
*  by the way. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  All right, well today in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=65.84s)]
*  the afternoon, there was a group of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=67.48s)]
*  conservative influencers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=69.88s)]
*  Let's take a look at the footage. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=71.94s)]
*  They're at the White House, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=74.92s)]
*  they're being given these binders. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=76.84s)]
*  And the binders say something along [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=79.56s)]
*  the lines of Epstein files part one. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=82.32s)]
*  Essentially, these are the files [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=85.16s)]
*  that we've been waiting for. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  This is the first batch, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=87.72s)]
*  the Epstein files, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  phase one, I should say. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  So the New York Post notes that at [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=91.64s)]
*  least one recipient left [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=94.0s)]
*  underwhelmed by what the documents [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=95.96s)]
*  revealed or I guess didn't reveal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  A source who reviewed the files [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  prior to that whole photo op [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=103.52s)]
*  situation that you all witnessed, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=105.36s)]
*  told the New York Post ahead of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  the documents release that it was [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=109.72s)]
*  almost 100 pages of Epstein's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=111.96s)]
*  address book or a list of contacts [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=114.0s)]
*  without any further context. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=116.44s)]
*  So, I mean, even sleazebags and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=119.64s)]
*  terrible people like Jeffrey Epstein [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=122.32s)]
*  might have an address book full of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=125.3s)]
*  people who aren't implicated at any [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=127.66s)]
*  type of wrongdoing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=130.04s)]
*  You need the context, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=131.6s)]
*  you need to understand who [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=132.76s)]
*  the clients were, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=134.0s)]
*  what's the client's list, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=134.88s)]
*  that was not released. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=136.32s)]
*  Now, this person added the unveiling [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=137.88s)]
*  was likely to be a disappointment [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=140.24s)]
*  to sleuths eager for bombshell [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=142.68s)]
*  new evidence about Epstein's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=144.84s)]
*  connections to prominent political [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  and business leaders. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=149.24s)]
*  Now, which political leaders are we [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=150.44s)]
*  talking about here? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=152.16s)]
*  We've talked about this before, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=153.4s)]
*  but just to remind you all, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=154.96s)]
*  former President Bill Clinton, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=156.28s)]
*  Bill Gates, Prince Andrew, and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=158.02s)]
*  President Trump are among the high [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=159.86s)]
*  profile people who associated with [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  Epstein, though Trump reportedly [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=163.88s)]
*  banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  2007 over an incident. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  With a club members daughter. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I was curious about that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=173.4s)]
*  So I looked into it and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  the Miami Herald actually did [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=176.88s)]
*  report that Epstein had hit on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  a club members teenage daughter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=182.12s)]
*  And at that point Trump allegedly [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=185.68s)]
*  banned him from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=187.56s)]
*  Okay, so look, my thoughts on that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=189.12s)]
*  are two directions real quick on [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=193.52s)]
*  Actually first one of our members [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=195.12s)]
*  Funken for Fun wrote in Epstein [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=197.0s)]
*  and Jay redacted. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=198.84s)]
*  Okay, but in this case in all [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=200.8s)]
*  fairness, not redacted. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=202.28s)]
*  He's in the phone book. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=204.08s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=205.0s)]
*  To be fair to everybody in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  the phone book, which is a funny [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=207.08s)]
*  thing to be fair, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=208.16s)]
*  like Chris Cuomo's wife is randomly [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=208.84s)]
*  in the phone book. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=210.4s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people were. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=211.16s)]
*  Yeah, because he knew a lot of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=212.24s)]
*  people, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=213.52s)]
*  So but was Donald Trump friends [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=214.56s)]
*  with him and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=216.04s)]
*  did he know his situation? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=216.6s)]
*  You know the quote I'm going to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=218.0s)]
*  read if you watch the Young Turks. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=219.12s)]
*  Trump in 2002, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=220.6s)]
*  I've known Jeff for 15 years, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=221.84s)]

*  did he really ban him, I guess? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=247.96s)]

*  Have you? Because we've had decades [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=326.0s)]

*  is there are a lot of victims. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=336.88s)]
*  She's not talking about reaching [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=338.56s)]

*  If they're actually trying to be [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=347.88s)]

*  the full files, I say, my God, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=349.76s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=353.0s)]

*  Well, they didn't release [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=354.64s)]

*  backlash from Trump supporters, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=357.79999999999995s)]

*  Now, let's talk about the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=384.68s)]
*  influencers who actually got those [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=386.40000000000003s)]

*  So one of them was actually [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  podcaster Liz Wheeler, who later [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=394.16s)]

*  information being released by [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=471.88s)]
*  my office. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=473.52s)]
*  What kind? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=474.8s)]
*  Are we going to see who was on [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=475.56s)]
*  the flights? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=477.2s)]
*  Are we going to see any evidence [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  from what he recorded because he [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=480.16s)]
*  had all of his homes wired with [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  recording devices? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=483.68s)]
*  Yeah, what you're going to see, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=485.36s)]
*  hopefully tomorrow, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=487.48s)]
*  is a lot of flight logs, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=489.0s)]
*  a lot of names, a lot of information, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=490.64s)]
*  but it's pretty sick what that man [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=492.91999999999996s)]
*  did. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=495.4s)]
*  Okay, well, along with his [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  co-defendant. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=497.52s)]
*  Absolutely, and he had help, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=498.44s)]
*  that's for sure. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=500.28s)]
*  He sure did. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=501.36s)]
*  So why did she say that last night [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=502.91999999999996s)]
*  when today she did not release [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=505.52s)]
*  the goods? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=508.28s)]
*  She said nothing about the SDNY. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=509.47999999999996s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  All right, so they tried this. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=514.4s)]
*  If you remember during the campaign, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=516.36s)]
*  we covered this hilarious clip [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=518.48s)]
*  where they said, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=520.04s)]
*  we covered this hilarious clip [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=520.9599999999999s)]
*  where they asked Donald Trump, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=522.52s)]
*  are you going to release [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=523.9599999999999s)]
*  the JFK files? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=524.88s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=525.56s)]
*  Area 51, absolutely. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=526.16s)]
*  Epstein files, less so. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=528.52s)]
*  Wait, what happened? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=531.0799999999999s)]
*  Why less so? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=531.88s)]
*  Why less so? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=533.04s)]
*  So then they try this gimmick of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=534.12s)]
*  we are releasing some of the files, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=535.64s)]
*  Epstein files, and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=537.52s)]
*  it's terrible what he did. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=538.56s)]
*  We all know it's terrible [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  what he did. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=541.12s)]
*  Okay, but who did it with him? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  What did they do exactly? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=543.8s)]
*  So they try this, and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  even their own influencers, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=547.56s)]
*  I mean, a nice cover try by [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=549.3199999999999s)]
*  Liz Wheeler, but overall, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=551.16s)]
*  almost all of MAGA is mad. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=553.12s)]
*  And I mean, the representative that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=555.4s)]
*  we quoted there, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=557.4s)]
*  massively right wing, right? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=558.36s)]
*  And it's definitely not part of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  the resistance, okay? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  So but you see now there's a little [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  bit of a different resistance from [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=565.72s)]
*  other quarters, right? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=567.16s)]
*  So now, SDNY, just so you know, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=568.88s)]
*  Southern District of New York. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  Got it, okay. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  So that's the most powerful [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=574.76s)]
*  prosecutorial office within [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=577.32s)]
*  the Justice Department. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=579.1600000000001s)]
*  It's in Manhattan, and [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=580.9200000000001s)]
*  they would make sense. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=582.32s)]
*  Epstein got arrested there, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=584.2s)]
*  they would have a lot of the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=585.52s)]
*  evidence. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=586.72s)]
*  A lot of it happened in New York, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=587.44s)]
*  and they were going to prosecute [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=589.0s)]
*  him. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  So it could be that that's true. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=592.0s)]
*  And by the way, I would want to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=594.72s)]
*  know a lot about that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=595.88s)]
*  And look, just for one second, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  assume they're telling the truth, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=598.96s)]
*  I know hilarious, but [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=600.96s)]
*  assume it for a second. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=602.1600000000001s)]
*  Then they should really go find all [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=604.0400000000001s)]
*  the evidence including what [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  happened to the tape on the night [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=608.2800000000001s)]
*  that he committed suicide. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=610.2800000000001s)]
*  Where did that tape go? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=612.6400000000001s)]
*  Did anyone talk to the guards? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  All the real evidence of what [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  actually happened to him. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=617.1600000000001s)]
*  And if they reveal all that, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=618.6800000000001s)]
*  I will give them so much credit [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  that everyone on the left [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=621.7600000000001s)]
*  will hate me. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=623.1600000000001s)]
*  No, no, don't give them credit. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=624.0s)]
*  But right now, okay, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=626.88s)]
*  now back to reality. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=627.96s)]
*  You never mentioned [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=629.44s)]
*  Southern District of New York. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=630.08s)]
*  No, not until now. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=631.12s)]

*  there are records, but it was [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=654.84s)]

*  So I'm wondering where the talking [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=719.68s)]
*  point is coming from because today, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=721.16s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi actually [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=723.32s)]

*  Bondi suggested in a Thursday [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=730.2s)]
*  letter to FBI Director Kash Patel [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=732.24s)]
*  that more records were recently [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=734.6s)]
*  discovered. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=736.84s)]
*  She ordered the FBI to hand over [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=737.8000000000001s)]
*  the full and complete Epstein files [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=739.64s)]
*  to her by Friday morning and [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=742.0s)]
*  directed Patel conduct [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=743.88s)]
*  an immediate investigation into why [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=745.52s)]
*  her order to the FBI to turn over [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=747.96s)]
*  all documents was not followed. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=750.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay, so here's my theories. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=752.96s)]
*  One is it could have terrible [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=755.64s)]
*  stuff about Trump because remember [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=757.48s)]
*  there's recordings. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=759.64s)]
*  So if you're in the recordings, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=760.92s)]
*  you're in the recordings. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=762.32s)]
*  So that's going to be super [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=764.0s)]
*  interesting. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=765.52s)]
*  That's one possibility, okay? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=766.52s)]
*  And as you know, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=768.56s)]
*  we just read you the quote, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=769.32s)]
*  whether he kicked him out later for [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=770.84s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago or not, solidly in 02, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=772.92s)]
*  said solidly great friends for [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=775.12s)]
*  15 years. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=777.04s)]
*  And then you add the other five on [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=777.8s)]
*  top for 20 straight years. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=779.76s)]
*  Okay, so we'll see. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=781.56s)]
*  And by the way, it's also super [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=784.68s)]
*  embarrassing for the country if [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  they've got Bill Clinton on tape, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=787.6s)]

*  the list. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=792.4399999999999s)]
*  It's so embarrassing for [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=793.0s)]
*  the country. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=793.92s)]
*  I mean, we have such a clean, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  squeaky record already. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=796.16s)]
*  Yeah, but a lot of people, but [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=797.84s)]
*  remember, since people are in their [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=799.48s)]
*  bubbles, the Democrats think that [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=801.36s)]
*  they are really squeaky clean and [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  the Republicans on the list are [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=804.8s)]
*  the bad guys. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=806.28s)]
*  A Democratic president got a blowy [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=807.16s)]
*  in the Oval Office from an intern. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=809.0799999999999s)]
*  So I'm sorry. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=810.96s)]
*  I know, but they just, but no, yes, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=812.12s)]
*  but he did it in a nice way. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=814.6s)]
*  Okay, so- [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=816.44s)]
*  Do you know what he did with [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=818.0s)]
*  the cigar? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=818.8000000000001s)]

*  The Republican bubble is like, no, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=823.0400000000001s)]
*  all the Democratic meanies on that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=824.52s)]
*  list are the biggest perverts, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=826.0s)]
*  pedophiles in the world. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=827.2s)]
*  Every Republican on that list, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=828.32s)]
*  including Trump, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=829.76s)]
*  it's squeaky clean angel, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=830.48s)]
*  Okay, so all right, so [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  now the second theory. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=834.76s)]
*  There is a certain special ally who [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=837.64s)]
*  is rumored to have worked with [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=839.9599999999999s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=842.1999999999999s)]
*  And that special ally has enormous [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=843.64s)]
*  power and influence in this country [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  and has enormous power and influence [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=848.8399999999999s)]
*  in the Democratic Party and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=851.4799999999999s)]
*  the Republican Party. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=853.4399999999999s)]
*  With Joe Biden and [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=855.28s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=857.0799999999999s)]
*  So, and who would be powerful [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=859.64s)]
*  enough to have someone commit [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=862.16s)]
*  suicide in the middle of [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=864.64s)]
*  an American prison? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=866.76s)]
*  And all of a sudden, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=869.76s)]
*  all the records disappear overnight. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=870.76s)]
*  But hey, we have a lot of special [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=873.12s)]
*  allies, that could have been [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=874.6s)]
*  Norway. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=875.92s)]
*  Okay, well, I don't know. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=877.36s)]
*  And by the way, it might not have [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=878.6s)]
*  been any of them. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=879.84s)]
*  It might, we don't know, because [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=880.96s)]
*  the files are super, super, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=882.72s)]
*  duper, duper secret. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=884.16s)]
*  What is the one special ally that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=885.88s)]
*  has the power to keep super, duper, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=887.72s)]
*  duper secrets? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=889.72s)]
*  Because we're not really in charge [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=891.12s)]
*  someone else's. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=893.32s)]
*  Could be Sweden, who knows? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=895.52s)]
*  But it's okay when he does it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=898.04s)]
*  Okay, no, no, no, because there was [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=900.16s)]
*  actually human shields and [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=902.28s)]
*  then that's why and [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=903.7199999999999s)]
*  then a collateral damage. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=904.68s)]
*  And then the more moral pervert and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=906.52s)]
*  then the other perverts are bad, but [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=908.56s)]
*  he's the most moral pervert. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=910.5999999999999s)]
*  So it was okay. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=912.24s)]
*  He's national security. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=913.28s)]
*  Yeah, hey, look, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=914.52s)]
*  he had to do something and collect [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=915.28s)]
*  tapes on all of our politicians. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  By the way, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=920.16s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy Jr. also on the list. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=920.88s)]
*  Huge Israeli supporter for [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=924.1999999999999s)]
*  no apparent reason. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=925.88s)]
*  Okay, look, you want me to say it? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=928.24s)]
*  I mean, so- [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=930.0s)]
*  No, no, I think you've said enough. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=930.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=931.6s)]
*  I think you've said enough. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=932.12s)]
*  I'm going to end on this though, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=932.72s)]

*  Jeffrey Epstein was absolutely [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9p_Gl88A4&t=937.36s)]
