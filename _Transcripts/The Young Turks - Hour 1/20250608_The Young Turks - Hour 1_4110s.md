TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

# Elon Musk And Donald Trump CRASH OUT In Stunning Fight. Here's WHY.
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E)
*  Damn, civil wars begun within [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=0.0s)]
*  MAGA, Donald Trump versus Elon [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2.0s)]
*  Musk, this is the mother of all [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4.24s)]
*  battles within MAGA, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=6.44s)]
*  who's going to win? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=7.9s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  So he did catch feelings about not [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=10.6s)]
*  being able to lead Doge. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=12.88s)]
*  Okay, wow. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=14.52s)]
*  Let me say this, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=17.32s)]
*  it's very disappointing, okay? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=18.3s)]
*  I've come to consider Elon [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=20.28s)]
*  a good friend. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=21.92s)]
*  He's obviously a very intelligent [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=22.88s)]
*  person and he's done a lot of great [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=24.76s)]
*  work. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=26.64s)]
*  With all due respect, my friend [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=27.16s)]
*  is terribly wrong about the one big [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=28.8s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=30.84s)]
*  Spoiler alert, not only is Elon [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=33.68s)]
*  Musk not wrong about the so-called [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=35.64s)]
*  big beautiful bill, he and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=37.84s)]
*  Mike Johnson doesn't seem like [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=39.64s)]
*  they're really friends. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=41.64s)]
*  So let me get into the latest [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=43.16s)]
*  updates on this quarrel that's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=45.24s)]
*  playing out between Elon Musk and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=47.7s)]
*  the Republican caucus in attempting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=50.24s)]
*  to pass this bill, which would, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=53.24s)]
*  of course, add to our debt and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=55.72s)]
*  deficit. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=57.92s)]
*  Now- [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  But Ana, I gotta say, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  I gotta interrupt for a second. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=60.4s)]
*  Because let's be honest, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=61.88s)]
*  it's not just about [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=62.96s)]
*  the Republican caucus. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  Elon Musk is definitely taking [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=64.88s)]
*  a shot at Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=66.2s)]
*  Trump says this is his most [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=67.6s)]
*  important bill and it's true, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=68.76s)]
*  it is, because this is where he's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=70.12s)]
*  going to get paid and all of his [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=71.6s)]
*  donors are going to get paid and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=72.8s)]
*  all the rich are going to get paid. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=74.04s)]
*  So to him, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=75.92s)]
*  this is the most critical bill. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=76.48s)]
*  So Elon trying to torpedo it is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=78.08s)]
*  a massive piece of drama between [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=79.92s)]
*  the two principal players. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=81.84s)]
*  The reason Elon is saying Congress [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=83.44s)]
*  and congressional Republicans is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=85.12s)]
*  Trump is he's trying to tone down [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=86.76s)]
*  the drama by like two inches, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=88.52s)]
*  2%, right? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=90.12s)]
*  But we know, we know, yeah, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=91.6s)]
*  they're definitely now in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=93.16s)]
*  loggerheads. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=94.8s)]
*  No, no, shots are being fired. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=95.68s)]
*  So let's start with House Speaker [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=97.12s)]
*  Mike Johnson, who's now fighting [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=99.4s)]
*  this all out war with Elon Musk. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=101.6s)]
*  And that's because the former head [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=104.12s)]
*  of Doge has been taking some pretty [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=106.12s)]
*  massive shots at Trump's big, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=108.16s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, let's rewind for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=111.0s)]
*  just one second to kind of explain [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=112.28s)]
*  how we got to this point. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=114.28s)]
*  So during a recent interview with [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=116.2s)]
*  CBS, Elon Musk stated that he was [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=118.12s)]
*  disappointed with Trump's big, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=120.04s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=121.84s)]
*  Here's what he had to say about it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=122.92s)]
*  I was disappointed to see the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=125.64s)]
*  massive spending bill, frankly, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  which increases the budget deficit [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=129.36s)]
*  not just decrease it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  And it reminds the work that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  the Doge team is doing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=134.52s)]
*  I actually thought that when this [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=136.84s)]
*  big beautiful bill came along, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=138.32s)]
*  everything he's done on Doge gets [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=139.84s)]
*  wiped out in the first year. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=141.68s)]
*  I think a bill can be big or [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  it can be beautiful. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=146.12s)]
*  But I don't know if it could be [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=148.0s)]
*  both, my personal opinion. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=149.96s)]
*  So after Elon Musk said that, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  Mike Johnson went to a laundromat, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=156.12s)]
*  watched all of the machines spin so [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  he can engage in the spin cycle. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=160.56s)]
*  Totally tried to spin this entire [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=162.56s)]
*  situation, writing on X. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=164.8s)]
*  The House made sure to build on [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=167.4s)]
*  Doge's success within the one big [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=169.08s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  Stephen Miller has made an [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  important point, no he hasn't, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  about the two efforts. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=175.44s)]
*  Doge found savings in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=176.56s)]
*  discretionary spending such as [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=177.88s)]
*  funding agencies while our one big [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=179.88s)]
*  beautiful bill secured over $1.6 [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  trillion in savings in mandatory [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=184.44s)]
*  spending such as Medicaid. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=186.83999999999997s)]
*  So there you have Mike Johnson [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=189.76s)]
*  clearly admitting that Republicans [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=191.88s)]
*  secured some pretty deep cuts to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=194.72s)]
*  programs like Medicaid in order to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=197.2s)]
*  give even more handouts and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  tax breaks that disproportionately [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=202.0s)]
*  benefit the richest among us. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=204.72s)]
*  And yet, by the way, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  the big beautiful bill would do [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=208.84s)]
*  exactly what Elon Musk is warning [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  about, it would blow up the deficit [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  even worse than we already have it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=213.84s)]
*  So the committee for [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=215.96s)]
*  a responsible federal budget [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  estimates that the bill would add [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=218.36s)]
*  $3 trillion to the debt, including [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=220.12s)]
*  interest over the next decade. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=222.08s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office had [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=224.32000000000002s)]

*  Musk say, then almost all [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=501.76s)]
*  the independents go, okay, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  I guess so, it is true. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=505.12s)]
*  They are adding at a minimum [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=506.6s)]
*  3.8 trillion to the debt. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=508.28000000000003s)]
*  So that's huge. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=510.16s)]
*  Number two good thing is, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=510.92s)]
*  they're fighting. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=512.36s)]
*  And that's not like a fake fight [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=513.36s)]
*  like they've had in the past with [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=515.2s)]
*  golly gee, the Tea Party would like [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=517.72s)]
*  you to be more conservative. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=519.52s)]
*  No, Republicans don't want more [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=521.12s)]
*  tax cuts for the rich. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, golly gee, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  we agreed on more. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  No, it's not one of those, okay? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  They're actually fighting. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=527.08s)]
*  And so that's positive because at [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=528.76s)]
*  least one side is showing some of [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=530.88s)]
*  the ugly parts of this agenda, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=532.88s)]
*  right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=534.96s)]
*  So now, okay, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=535.88s)]
*  where's the giant caveat? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=537.08s)]
*  They still don't get them wrong, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  don't get it to any of this [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=541.24s)]
*  twisted. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  All of the Republican leaders still [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=543.64s)]
*  are in La La Land where they think [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=546.48s)]
*  they're going to find $4 trillion [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=548.76s)]
*  in spending cuts. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  Like, none of them have talked [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=553.0s)]
*  about not doing the giant tax [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=555.04s)]
*  cuts for the rich except Ron [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=557.04s)]
*  Johnson miraculously, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=559.04s)]
*  And we covered that on [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=561.6s)]
*  an earlier show. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=562.8s)]
*  But outside of that, they're like, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=564.36s)]
*  yeah, man, we're going to find [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=566.12s)]
*  spending cuts, yeah. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=567.56s)]
*  No, Cenk, you're being way, way, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=568.52s)]
*  way, way too generous. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=570.16s)]
*  No, they don't actually believe [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=571.4399999999999s)]
*  they're going to find $4 trillion [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=573.52s)]
*  in savings. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=575.88s)]
*  They don't believe it, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=576.92s)]
*  they never believed it, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=577.84s)]
*  they never intended to balance [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=578.96s)]
*  the budget. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  Balancing the budget has never been [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=581.32s)]
*  a priority for either party. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=583.4s)]
*  I'm just going to be honest with [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=585.48s)]
*  you about that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=586.72s)]
*  And yes, that includes Republicans [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=587.32s)]
*  who tend to pretend that they care [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=589.08s)]
*  about the deficit and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=590.6s)]
*  the federal debt the most. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=591.6s)]
*  I think that there are voters who [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=593.16s)]
*  are concerned about the deficit, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=594.92s)]
*  who are worried about the $36 [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=596.8s)]
*  trillion debt, especially [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=598.24s)]
*  considering the fact that we're now [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  spending a trillion dollars a year [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=601.0s)]
*  to service it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=602.52s)]
*  That is a problem. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=603.48s)]
*  But hold on, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=604.32s)]
*  they just want their tax cuts. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=605.4s)]
*  They want to do a favor for [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=607.4s)]
*  their donors, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=608.68s)]
*  this is what their donors want. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=609.36s)]
*  And let's not forget, a lot of [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=610.84s)]
*  these members of Congress are very [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=612.52s)]
*  wealthy themselves, they want a [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=614.52s)]
*  little bit of a tax break as well. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=616.32s)]
*  I don't believe for a second that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=618.44s)]
*  they actually think they're going [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=619.76s)]
*  to find $4 trillion in savings. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=621.16s)]
*  No, no, that's why I want to be [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=622.72s)]
*  very clear. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=624.16s)]
*  So there's two teams here, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=624.88s)]
*  Team Trump and Team Elon, right? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=626.2s)]
*  So Team Trump is actually old [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=628.0s)]
*  school uniparty established [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=629.64s)]
*  from politics in this case. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=631.36s)]
*  In this case, yes. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=632.72s)]
*  Right, in this case, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=633.4s)]
*  you're like, hey, you know what? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=634.4s)]
*  They're doing exactly what Anna [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=636.2s)]
*  said. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=637.96s)]
*  It's magic. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=639.0s)]
*  We'll do 4 trillion in tax cuts, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=640.16s)]
*  mainly going to the wealthy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=642.4s)]
*  We won't cut any spending, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=644.48s)]
*  we'll add spending to the Pentagon [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=645.92s)]
*  and to other places where you [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  wanted to cut. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=649.12s)]
*  And we'll just cut from the poor, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=650.24s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=651.84s)]
*  And that won't be anywhere near [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=652.44s)]
*  enough because we're going to [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=654.24s)]
*  gorge on tax cuts. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=655.88s)]
*  So that is classic Republican [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=657.24s)]
*  uniparty establishment strategy. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=659.96s)]
*  Now you go over to Team Elon with [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=663.48s)]
*  Rand Paul and the others, right? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=665.2s)]
*  That team is now saying, okay, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=666.9200000000001s)]
*  everyone else is right, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=669.2s)]
*  the CBO is right. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=671.12s)]
*  Yes, it does add 4 trillion to [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=672.64s)]
*  the deficit, okay? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=674.52s)]
*  So that's a huge admission that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=676.36s)]
*  the Republicans never do, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=677.72s)]
*  But Anna, that's the team that's [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=679.52s)]
*  pretending there's 4 trillion [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  spending cuts. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=684.12s)]
*  And because none of them, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=685.4s)]
*  literally none of them say, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=687.08s)]
*  other than Ron Johnson once said it [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=688.88s)]
*  and I bet he takes it back, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=691.04s)]
*  are saying maybe we shouldn't do [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=693.12s)]
*  gigantic tax cuts for the rich. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=695.0s)]
*  Correct, okay, then I agree with [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  your analysis 100% because I don't [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=698.52s)]
*  want anyone to make the mistake of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=700.3199999999999s)]
*  thinking Elon's the good guy here [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=702.0799999999999s)]
*  because- [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=704.04s)]
*  That's his, yeah, exactly. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=705.12s)]
*  Well, Elon is correct in noting [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=706.4799999999999s)]
*  that this adds to our federal debt. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=708.52s)]
*  He is correct about that. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=711.12s)]
*  His priority is not to balance [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=712.8399999999999s)]
*  the budget by doing away with [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=714.92s)]
*  the unfairness of the tax policy [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=716.9599999999999s)]
*  that's included, which again, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=719.4s)]
*  leads to less revenue for [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=722.56s)]
*  the federal government because of [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=724.1999999999999s)]
*  the major tax breaks that again, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=726.52s)]
*  disproportionately benefit [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=728.56s)]
*  the rich. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=730.28s)]
*  Now I want to be fair and also note, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=731.0s)]
*  Trump is trying to make good on his [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=733.28s)]
*  promise of no tax on tips. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=735.4799999999999s)]
*  And based on reporting, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=737.76s)]
*  the provision related to that would [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=739.56s)]
*  basically allow those in the service [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  industry to earn up to $25,000 in [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=745.12s)]
*  tips that will not be taxed, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=748.0s)]
*  which is pretty huge. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=750.1999999999999s)]
*  $25,000 is huge. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=751.9599999999999s)]
*  There's a chance that- [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  They might take that out though, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=755.0s)]
*  let's keep it real. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=756.76s)]
*  No, no, no, that's exactly what [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=757.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm getting to. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=759.36s)]
*  There's a chance that team Elon is [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=759.9599999999999s)]
*  worse than team Trump. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  So right now they look better [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=763.68s)]
*  because they're at least [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=765.16s)]
*  acknowledging, yes, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=766.1999999999999s)]
*  we are adding 4 trillion to [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=767.16s)]
*  the debt, right? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=768.48s)]
*  And so that's a huge moment. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=769.4s)]
*  But probably what they'll do in [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=771.12s)]
*  the Senate, what are they going to [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=772.8399999999999s)]
*  take out, something for the rich? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=774.52s)]
*  No chance, 0%. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=775.9599999999999s)]
*  There's no chance, those are [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=776.68s)]
*  the donors. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=777.88s)]
*  No chance, 0%. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=778.52s)]
*  Those are the donors. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=779.44s)]
*  0%, Elon, Rand Paul, every one of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=780.28s)]
*  those guys work for the donors or [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=782.2s)]
*  are the donors and are stupid rich. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=784.28s)]
*  And they're like, no way, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=786.84s)]
*  the most important thing is tax [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=788.36s)]
*  cuts for billionaires. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=790.16s)]
*  Number one priority, always for [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=791.5600000000001s)]
*  every single Republican of my [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=793.52s)]
*  lifetime, period, okay? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=795.36s)]
*  So they're never going to change [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=797.28s)]
*  that. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=798.6s)]
*  So what they'll likely do is go, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=799.1s)]
*  well, there is too much in [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=801.04s)]
*  spending and cuts, so we're going [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=802.6s)]
*  to have to take out the tax cut on [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=804.64s)]
*  tips and overtime, okay? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  I would not be surprised. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=808.8s)]
*  I honestly wouldn't be. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=810.0s)]
*  So let's keep a close eye on that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=810.76s)]
*  because that'll show you what [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=812.56s)]
*  the real priorities are. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=814.24s)]
*  Not just for Elon Musk, for [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=816.24s)]
*  the Republican Party as well. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=817.36s)]
*  Now, in response to these [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=818.96s)]
*  criticisms coming from Elon Musk, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=820.56s)]
*  Mike Johnson was actually [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=822.84s)]
*  responding to Musk's comments in [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  the video that we showed you at [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=826.4399999999999s)]
*  the very top of this segment. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=828.08s)]
*  But here's where things get [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=829.88s)]
*  interesting because Johnson also [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=831.48s)]
*  accused Musk of acting out of [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=833.76s)]
*  self-interest. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=835.44s)]
*  Wow, shocking. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=838.08s)]
*  Not like Mike Johnson, by the way, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  is acting out of self-interest or [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=841.48s)]
*  anyone else in Congress is acting [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=842.96s)]
*  out of self-interest. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=844.44s)]
*  I want to go to the video and [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=845.84s)]
*  then get your response. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=846.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=847.44s)]
*  I've said this many times, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=849.1600000000001s)]
*  I'll be saying it until we get [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=850.1600000000001s)]
*  this thing over the line. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=851.1600000000001s)]
*  This is the most amount of money [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=852.6400000000001s)]
*  that any government has ever saved [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=854.0400000000001s)]
*  on planet Earth in a piece [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=855.6s)]
*  of legislation, ever. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=856.7600000000001s)]
*  It's a very important first start. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=858.08s)]
*  Elon is missing it, okay? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=860.0s)]
*  And it's not personal. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=861.72s)]
*  I know that the EB mandate, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=864.0s)]
*  very important to him, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=865.5600000000001s)]
*  that is going away. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=866.96s)]
*  Because the government should not [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=868.72s)]
*  be subsidizing these things. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=869.96s)]
*  It's part of the Green New Deal. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=871.1600000000001s)]
*  And I know that has an effect on [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=872.44s)]
*  this business and I lament that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=873.5600000000001s)]
*  We talked about the ramp down [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=875.5200000000001s)]
*  period on that and [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=876.9200000000001s)]
*  how that should be duly considered [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=878.12s)]
*  by Congress. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=880.1600000000001s)]
*  But for him to come out and [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=880.84s)]
*  hand the whole bill is to me just [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=881.96s)]
*  very disappointing, very surprising [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=884.8000000000001s)]
*  in light of the conversation I [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=886.5600000000001s)]
*  had with him yesterday. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=887.44s)]
*  Do you think that's his test laws [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=888.2s)]
*  that's driving this, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=889.72s)]
*  as I was suggesting? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=890.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to let others draw [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  their own conclusions about that. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=893.0s)]
*  But this is not personal between [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=894.2s)]
*  any of us. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=896.2s)]
*  I just deeply regret that he's made [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=896.8000000000001s)]
*  this mistake. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=899.2s)]
*  Look at this little gangster over [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  here, right? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=904.08s)]
*  Hey, Elon, we know those federal [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=905.0400000000001s)]
*  tax subsidies for [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=907.6800000000001s)]
*  EVs mean a lot to you. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=909.2800000000001s)]
*  Be a real shame if something [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=912.12s)]
*  happened to that provision, right? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=913.44s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=915.52s)]
*  He said EV mandate, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=916.9200000000001s)]
*  what he was referring to were [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=917.88s)]
*  the tax subsidies for [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=919.32s)]
*  those who buy EVs. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=920.48s)]
*  And apparently, it was something [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=922.0s)]
*  that started in the Obama [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=923.92s)]
*  administration. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=925.36s)]
*  The federal government had offered [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=926.92s)]
*  Americans $7,500 in tax credits on [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=929.28s)]
*  electric vehicles. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=931.76s)]
*  And that tax credit was originally [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=933.16s)]
*  going to expire in 2032. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=935.64s)]
*  But the big beautiful bill includes [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  a provision that changes the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=939.68s)]
*  expiration date of that provision [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=941.56s)]
*  to the end of this year. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=943.84s)]
*  So that is a huge blow to Tesla and [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=945.64s)]
*  electric vehicles. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=947.96s)]
*  So now let's break it down. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=950.16s)]
*  Look, this is why it's important [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=951.44s)]
*  that you watch an honest show, so [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=952.82s)]
*  we can tell you who's lying and [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=954.24s)]
*  who's telling the truth about [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  different things, okay? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=956.7600000000001s)]
*  By the way, Democrats included, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=958.4000000000001s)]
*  of course, as you all know. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=960.1600000000001s)]
*  In this case, though, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=962.08s)]
*  this is why the fight is good. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=963.4000000000001s)]
*  Because now, Elon Musk and [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=965.2s)]
*  Rand Paul says something true about [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=967.1600000000001s)]
*  Team Trump, which is they're going [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=969.6s)]
*  to add at least 4 trillion, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=971.72s)]
*  maybe 5 trillion to the debt, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=973.2s)]
*  right? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=974.72s)]
*  Now, Ron Johnson is saying [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=975.24s)]
*  something true about Elon Musk. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=976.6400000000001s)]
*  He's saying, well, he is a donor, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=978.4000000000001s)]
*  and apparently that's between [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=980.72s)]
*  the lines, right? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=983.0s)]
*  But we took away his tax credit, so [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=984.6800000000001s)]
*  now he's mad. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=987.1600000000001s)]
*  And they added a fee to EVs. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=988.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=991.44s)]
*  So that is true. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=992.0400000000001s)]
*  So Speaker Johnson's correct about [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=994.24s)]
*  that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=996.44s)]
*  They did do that, that is a [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=997.2s)]
*  provision in the bill. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=998.6800000000001s)]
*  And I'm positive that Elon Musk is [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  furious about it, right? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1002.08s)]
*  So when you see Elon Musk going off [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1003.9200000000001s)]
*  on the bill, is it partly out of [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  self-interest, as Mike Johnson's [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1007.52s)]
*  saying there? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1009.8399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1011.0s)]
*  Absolutely, he wanted more [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1011.7199999999999s)]
*  goodies, more breaks, which, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1013.12s)]
*  by the way, would have added even [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1014.64s)]
*  more to the deficit, right? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1016.12s)]
*  So, and that makes sense, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1017.8s)]
*  that's what donors always want. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1018.9599999999999s)]
*  They always want to rob the taxpayer [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1020.4s)]
*  for their own benefit. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1022.3199999999999s)]
*  That is 90% of the reason why [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1023.4799999999999s)]
*  donors, especially corporate [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1025.36s)]
*  donors, give money to politicians, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1027.32s)]
*  period, right? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1029.52s)]
*  So you see how good the fight is, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1030.48s)]
*  because it's revealing, not to us, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  we already know, but to the right [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  wing base, hey, maybe Elon's [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1035.84s)]
*  acting out of self-interest. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1037.48s)]
*  And maybe this is going to add 4 [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1038.96s)]
*  trillion to the debt. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1040.3600000000001s)]
*  Now, let's go to what is [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1041.52s)]
*  the correct answer, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1042.98s)]
*  what the American people want, but [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1044.04s)]
*  have no chance of receiving. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1045.76s)]
*  So when I talk to MAGA about this, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1047.72s)]
*  when I get to, hey, what do we give [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1050.0s)]
*  an extra tax cuts to the rich for? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1052.3600000000001s)]
*  They hate it, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1055.08s)]
*  they don't agree with me, right? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1055.64s)]
*  They're like, no, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1057.16s)]
*  we need tax cuts, and [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1058.52s)]
*  the rich need to get it the most, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1060.0s)]
*  okay? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1062.16s)]
*  And later, I swear, they told me [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  they're going to give me a job. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1064.76s)]
*  And it's going to pay really well, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1066.48s)]
*  10 or 20 years from now. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1068.12s)]
*  And then they promised to trickle [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1069.6799999999998s)]
*  on me, and I am waiting for [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1071.32s)]
*  that trickle, right? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1072.48s)]
*  By the way, you guys know that you [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1074.12s)]
*  could actually just give it to [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1075.3999999999999s)]
*  the middle class instead. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1076.4399999999998s)]
*  I know that's never occurred, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1077.6799999999998s)]
*  that thought has never occurred to [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1079.08s)]
*  a Republican politician or [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1080.52s)]
*  to anyone in right-wing media. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1081.8799999999999s)]
*  And that is why right-wing voters [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1083.8799999999999s)]
*  don't know you could actually do [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1085.6799999999998s)]
*  economics called middle out. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1087.48s)]
*  Which where you give things to [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1089.84s)]
*  the middle class, and they spend [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1091.72s)]
*  money and create a virtuous cycle [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1093.8s)]
*  in the economy, which is much, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1095.84s)]
*  much more likely. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1097.68s)]
*  Instead, we're going with [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1098.64s)]
*  the dumb ass plan of giving [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1100.16s)]
*  everything to the top and go, well, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1101.64s)]
*  yeah, they'll hoard most of it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1103.8s)]
*  They'll save it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1105.64s)]
*  Isn't it good when rich people [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1106.2s)]
*  hoard the money and don't use it [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1107.5600000000002s)]
*  to stimulate the economy like [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1109.0800000000002s)]
*  working class people would? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1110.3200000000002s)]
*  Of course it's not good, but [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1111.48s)]
*  every liar in media pretends that [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1113.3200000000002s)]
*  that's a real idea. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1115.4s)]

*  that's a real idea. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1118.52s)]
*  No, trickle down economics, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1119.88s)]
*  supply side economics is a joke. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1121.28s)]
*  It's literally never worked in [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1123.76s)]
*  my lifetime. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1125.48s)]
*  It's just a shady excuse to give [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1126.28s)]
*  more money to the rich because [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1128.08s)]
*  they're the ones who donated to [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1129.68s)]
*  the politicians. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1131.52s)]
*  Now, so MAGA is totally [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1132.72s)]
*  unconvinced about the point that I [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1134.22s)]
*  just made, hardcore MAGA. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1136.52s)]
*  But they make the same mistake that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1138.36s)]
*  Biden and Kamala Harris supporters [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1140.56s)]

*  Queen Latifah endorsed Kamala Harris, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1144.82s)]

*  because I really like Queen Latifah [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1149.0s)]

*  I think Joe Biden's young, so [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1152.24s)]
*  everybody thinks Joe Biden is [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1153.48s)]

*  Well, I want tax cuts for [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1155.68s)]
*  the rich, so I'm sure the country [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1157.0s)]

*  American media? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1178.0s)]

*  And finally, the last part of this [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1235.32s)]
*  is at the very end of this drama is [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1237.28s)]
*  when the Democrats appear, okay? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1239.1999999999998s)]
*  And at the end, they come into [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1241.76s)]
*  Congress all singing together, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1243.56s)]
*  arms locked together going, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1245.56s)]
*  there was nothing we could do. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1247.28s)]
*  There was nothing we could do. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1249.24s)]
*  I mean, in this case, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1250.6s)]
*  there really isn't much they can [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1251.76s)]
*  do. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1253.52s)]
*  Yeah, they don't hold a majority in [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1254.04s)]
*  either chamber. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1256.2s)]
*  Yes, I agree that even if they did [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1257.4s)]
*  hold majorities in either chamber, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1259.28s)]
*  that's when they would claim [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1261.36s)]
*  there's nothing we can do when [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1263.04s)]
*  there clearly is. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1264.76s)]
*  I hear you, I hear you, and [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1266.04s)]
*  they really don't have the votes. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1267.24s)]
*  Okay, how do you- [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1268.92s)]
*  I love beating up on Democrats, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1269.48s)]

*  No, no, no. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1271.76s)]

*  Every single Democrat voted against [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1273.6399999999999s)]
*  the bill. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1275.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, the Democrats who showed up [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1276.12s)]
*  voted against the bill. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1277.3999999999999s)]
*  If they needed the votes, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1278.04s)]
*  I guarantee you they would have [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1279.0s)]
*  found corporate Democrats to get [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1280.04s)]
*  those votes. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1281.28s)]
*  I guarantee it, because why? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1281.84s)]
*  I've seen this movie a hundred [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1283.12s)]
*  times. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1284.28s)]
*  I've been covering politics for [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1285.0s)]
*  a quarter of a century. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1286.12s)]
*  Every single time the Republicans [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1287.32s)]
*  go, no, it won't add to the [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1289.0s)]
*  deficit, as we're now at $37 [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1290.12s)]

*  And every single time Democrats [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1293.56s)]
*  go, we are going to vote against it, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1295.0s)]
*  it is terrible. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1296.8s)]
*  Look at that, a couple of people [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1298.0s)]
*  flipped over or they didn't need [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1299.24s)]
*  it and there was nothing we could [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1300.52s)]
*  do, there was nothing we could do. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1301.56s)]
*  And so, Ana, what can they do? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1303.36s)]
*  Just real quick, you could fight [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1304.8s)]
*  them rhetorically. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1307.08s)]
*  There should be an army of [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1308.72s)]
*  Democrats on the air now going, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1310.24s)]

*  No, Hakeem Jeffries is on it, okay? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1314.72s)]
*  He told him already, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1316.96s)]
*  you're going to find out. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1317.8799999999999s)]

*  That's hilarious. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1321.44s)]
*  But you see what I'm saying, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1322.6399999999999s)]
*  whether it's that stat or [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1324.28s)]
*  any other stat or fact. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1325.6799999999998s)]
*  Right now, it should be in every [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1327.9199999999998s)]

*  1.7 trillion to the rich. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1333.24s)]
*  So whenever they think of the so [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1334.8000000000002s)]
*  called big beautiful bill, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1336.0s)]
*  they think that's 1.7 [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1337.1200000000001s)]
*  trillion to the rich, right? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1338.2s)]
*  How many Democrats are [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1340.16s)]
*  making that point? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1340.92s)]
*  Well, no, I'm just going to say [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1342.04s)]
*  zero, no, but Bernie makes that [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1343.0800000000002s)]
*  point. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1344.3200000000002s)]
*  AOC these days makes that point. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1344.92s)]
*  So a couple of them, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1346.68s)]
*  a couple of progressive [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1347.64s)]
*  populists do, right? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1348.5600000000002s)]
*  But the rest of them are like, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1349.76s)]
*  I can't wait for my donors to get [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1351.2s)]
*  those tax cuts, I mean Trump bad. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1352.92s)]
*  Elon Musk has been feuding with [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1355.52s)]
*  the House Republicans who, of [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1357.92s)]
*  course, passed Trump's big beautiful [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1359.92s)]
*  bill. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1362.24s)]
*  And Musk has kind of framed this [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1362.7600000000002s)]
*  argument as, look, I really care [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1364.5600000000002s)]
*  about government waste and this is [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1366.3000000000002s)]
*  just adding to the federal debt, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1368.2s)]

*  He's correct about that. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1370.88s)]
*  But there's a part of his problem [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1372.5600000000002s)]
*  with the bill that he's not really [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1374.88s)]

*  I want to kind of get into that. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1378.92s)]

*  So here we go. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1395.0s)]
*  What are those inflection points? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1396.4s)]
*  Well, they reportedly included [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1397.48s)]

*  being able to lead Doge. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1409.2s)]

*  So he wanted to stay there, but [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1414.8000000000002s)]
*  I guess Trump didn't make that [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1417.56s)]

*  So he puts his boy into NASA, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1473.56s)]
*  he'll be getting a lot more [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1475.1599999999999s)]
*  contracts from the government. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1476.6799999999998s)]
*  Like worth billions upon billions, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1478.52s)]
*  maybe hundreds of billions of [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1480.6s)]
*  dollars. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1482.2s)]
*  And so then that'll be a good [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1483.3999999999999s)]
*  return on his investment of about [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1484.6799999999998s)]
*  300 million that he put into Trump. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1486.08s)]
*  So here, now we covered the story [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1488.32s)]
*  earlier and we told you be careful. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1490.32s)]
*  Remember, even though Elon is [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1492.84s)]
*  correct in saying this does add 4 [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1494.6399999999999s)]
*  trillion to the debt. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1496.56s)]
*  He could have ulterior motives and [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1498.56s)]
*  we mentioned the tax credits. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1500.3999999999999s)]
*  And now we have the three other [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1502.36s)]
*  reasons. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1503.52s)]
*  Right, and I am now fully convinced [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1504.02s)]
*  that anyone who claims that they [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1506.08s)]
*  have an issue with something the [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1507.8799999999999s)]
*  government is doing because of [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1509.6799999999998s)]
*  debt is lying. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1511.3999999999999s)]
*  There's always an ulterior motive. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1513.24s)]
*  And in this case, Elon Musk didn't [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1515.36s)]
*  get all the cookies he wanted from [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1517.36s)]
*  his daddy Trump who he bribed. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1519.28s)]
*  To Trump's credit, I mean, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1521.28s)]
*  he's easy to bribe but [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1522.6799999999998s)]
*  apparently even he has his limits. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1523.8s)]
*  No, no, I'll give you a super [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1525.56s)]
*  ironic credit to Donald Trump on [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1526.9199999999998s)]
*  that, but first credit to me. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1528.4399999999998s)]
*  Okay, of course, of course, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1530.1999999999998s)]
*  how dare we even consider credit [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1531.6s)]
*  for anyone else before first [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1533.02s)]
*  giving you credit. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1534.1599999999999s)]
*  The only person that actually cares [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1535.28s)]
*  about the deficit is me. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1537.28s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1539.08s)]
*  Okay, in all politics, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1539.6799999999998s)]
*  I've never seen, sometimes [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1541.44s)]
*  the progressive side says, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1543.36s)]
*  deficits don't matter. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1545.56s)]
*  Dick Cheney said deficits don't [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1547.3999999999999s)]
*  matter. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1548.8799999999999s)]
*  Republicans go to movers, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1549.6s)]
*  deficits, deficits, and then they [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1551.08s)]
*  get into office and add way more [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1552.96s)]
*  than the Democrats do because they [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1554.6399999999999s)]
*  give away trillions in tax cuts. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1556.6799999999998s)]
*  But we have been consistent, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1559.1599999999999s)]
*  kidding aside, young Turks has been [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1560.92s)]
*  consistent on this for [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1562.76s)]
*  20 straight years, right? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1563.8799999999999s)]
*  Deficits do matter, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1565.2s)]
*  the Pentagon is bloated. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1566.8s)]
*  There is tons of pork barrel [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1569.16s)]
*  projects you could cut, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1570.72s)]
*  not from cancer research, but [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1572.16s)]
*  actual graft from donors, right? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1574.04s)]
*  That to give the pork to the [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1576.4s)]
*  donors and yes, stop giving the [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1578.28s)]
*  rich and corporations tax cuts. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1580.52s)]
*  Okay, now credit to Trump, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1583.28s)]
*  fair show in America. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1585.44s)]
*  So this is an ironic credit. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1587.64s)]
*  He always screws over his creditors, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1590.12s)]
*  always. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1593.0s)]
*  He went bankrupt six times. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1594.6399999999999s)]
*  That's a weird thing to [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1596.6s)]
*  get credit for. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1597.4399999999998s)]
*  No, no, I'm like, so I know, but [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1597.96s)]
*  listen, here's the upsides of it, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1599.8s)]
*  okay? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1602.0s)]
*  So, and every time he had this [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1602.84s)]
*  major bankruptcy and they'd say, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1604.6799999999998s)]
*  my God, you didn't pay any of your [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1606.9199999999998s)]
*  debts back. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1609.04s)]
*  He's like, yeah, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1609.76s)]
*  that's good business. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1610.56s)]
*  I take their money and [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1611.72s)]
*  then I don't pay them back. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1612.56s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1614.56s)]
*  He doesn't care about other human [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1615.56s)]
*  beings at all, right? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1616.96s)]
*  So that's a huge advantage, right? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1618.32s)]
*  That way you could just keep taking [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1620.68s)]
*  from people. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1622.12s)]
*  And he uses celebrity and [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1622.76s)]
*  marketing to keep getting new loans. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1624.08s)]
*  Now when he's the president, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1626.32s)]
*  the ironic upside of that is, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1628.08s)]
*  Elon Musk gives him $300 million [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1629.8799999999999s)]
*  and then he expects billions back [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1631.92s)]
*  from NASA and etc. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1634.08s)]
*  And Trump's like, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1635.6s)]
*  what do you mean? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1636.44s)]
*  I already got your money, sucker. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1637.52s)]
*  I gave you some cookies, but [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1640.32s)]
*  not all the cookies. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1641.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1642.2s)]
*  And then Sheldon and [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1643.24s)]
*  Mary Madeleine gave him even more, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1644.3999999999999s)]
*  $337 million over three election [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1646.48s)]
*  cycles and they're like, okay, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1648.64s)]
*  now you do exactly as Israel [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1650.76s)]
*  orders you, you go bomb Iran. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1652.44s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, except I [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1654.04s)]
*  already got your money. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1656.48s)]
*  So and Qatar just gave me a jet and [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1659.04s)]
*  made a $2 billion deal with [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1661.48s)]
*  my knucklehead son, okay? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1663.48s)]
*  So sorry. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1666.1200000000001s)]
*  My God. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1667.28s)]
*  Okay, so the fact that he screws [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1667.88s)]
*  over his creditors every single [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1669.92s)]
*  time- [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1671.8400000000001s)]
*  Credit where credit is due. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1672.44s)]
*  Hey, Ferris show in America, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1674.52s)]
*  because if he's screwing over his [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1676.28s)]
*  donors and not delivering for [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1678.08s)]
*  them, that's wonderful. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1679.68s)]
*  I love that, yeah, yeah. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1681.16s)]
*  That you see what I'm saying? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1682.28s)]
*  I mean, I love the donor part, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1683.16s)]
*  the creditor part. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1684.4s)]
*  No, the creditor part is terrible. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1685.6399999999999s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1686.8s)]
*  But the fact that he's carried that [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1687.56s)]
*  over and screwing over his own [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1689.16s)]
*  donors, no politician does that. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1690.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1692.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1693.22s)]
*  So- Yeah, I guess I will allow it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1693.72s)]
*  Bernie doesn't even take [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1696.08s)]
*  the donor money. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1696.92s)]
*  So the just Democrats don't take [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1697.6s)]
*  the donor money, so [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1698.96s)]
*  there's nobody to screw over. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1699.72s)]

*  Right. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1701.58s)]

*  But apparently there was a provision [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1771.52s)]
*  that she didn't read, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1773.56s)]
*  didn't know was included. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1774.84s)]
*  And now she's worried about it and [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1776.32s)]
*  is partly siding with Elon Musk. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1778.6399999999999s)]
*  So during an interview with [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1781.08s)]
*  News Nation last night, she said [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1782.8799999999999s)]

*  abomination, okay? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1792.92s)]
*  So she said that she was also [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1794.2s)]
*  careful to basically make her [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1796.2800000000002s)]
*  undying support for Donald Trump [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1798.44s)]

*  And that she overall still [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1807.24s)]
*  supported the spirit of the bill, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1809.2s)]
*  but that one provision, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1811.72s)]
*  that one provision. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1813.52s)]
*  Now let's hear what she [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1815.64s)]
*  has to say next. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1816.48s)]

*  spends for the border, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1827.8000000000002s)]
*  border security. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1829.4s)]

*  I think those things are important. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1831.96s)]
*  Do I like the spending? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1834.0s)]

*  We can't just cut our way out of [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1842.88s)]
*  this because the interest is [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1844.48s)]

*  where she does have a good point. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1919.48s)]

*  And the enforcement of dozens of [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1972.9199999999998s)]
*  pre existing state regulations [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  would be prohibited as well. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1976.9599999999998s)]
*  These existing rules take aim at [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1978.72s)]
*  widespread concerns like deep fake [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1980.9599999999998s)]
*  misinformation, algorithmic rent [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1983.56s)]

*  particularly of children, okay? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1990.24s)]
*  So basically, if a state decides, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1993.4s)]
*  all right, the federal government [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1995.3600000000001s)]
*  conquers totally useless. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1997.2s)]
*  So in our state, we're going to [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=1998.48s)]
*  make decisions about regulating [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2000.0800000000002s)]
*  artificial intelligence. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2001.68s)]
*  They're just not going to be able [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2003.3200000000002s)]
*  to do that if this bill passes [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2005.2800000000002s)]
*  the Senate with that provision [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2007.0800000000002s)]
*  included in it, Cenk. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2009.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so first of all, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2011.8400000000001s)]
*  this is going to help my reputation [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2013.44s)]
*  a lot. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2015.8000000000002s)]
*  So I'm going to agree with her on [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2017.24s)]
*  two things. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2019.2800000000002s)]
*  First, let me get out of the way [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2020.64s)]
*  the obvious things. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2022.68s)]
*  Was her not reading the bill ahead [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2024.44s)]
*  of voting for it bad? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2026.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, of course, of course, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2029.0800000000002s)]
*  it was obviously bad. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2030.92s)]
*  It was obviously haha. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2032.44s)]
*  It was obviously LOL, right? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2034.0800000000002s)]
*  Now having said that, it is one [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2036.76s)]
*  thing to give her credit on is, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2038.68s)]
*  it's an ironic kind of honesty. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2040.72s)]
*  Like with these professional actor [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2043.2800000000002s)]
*  politicians, you would never get [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2045.3600000000001s)]
*  that kind of honesty. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2047.44s)]
*  because it involves being slightly [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2048.96s)]
*  human, including making a mistake [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2050.7200000000003s)]
*  and owning up to it. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2053.08s)]
*  And even if she owned up to it in [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2054.7599999999998s)]
*  a way that was not perfectly [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2056.36s)]
*  conscious, like maybe she said, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2057.7599999999998s)]
*  I didn't read it, so I didn't know. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2059.52s)]
*  Oops, I shouldn't have said it. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2061.16s)]
*  However you interpret that, or [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2062.08s)]
*  it was courageous because she's [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2064.16s)]
*  in need, she knows she's going to [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2066.2s)]
*  get lambasted for it, but [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2068.08s)]
*  she does it anyway. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2069.52s)]
*  I don't care which of those [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2070.68s)]
*  interpretations you have, right? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2071.7999999999997s)]
*  So the bottom line is, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2073.36s)]
*  at least she's saying, yeah, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2074.36s)]
*  my bad, which a politician almost [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2075.64s)]
*  never says, right? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2077.2s)]
*  And then number two, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2078.6s)]
*  she's using it as a moment to focus [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2079.84s)]
*  on part of the bill that should be [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2082.04s)]
*  taken out. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2084.0s)]
*  And guys, if you're a right winger [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2084.84s)]
*  and you like Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2087.0s)]
*  right, remember, she's trying to [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2089.44s)]
*  remove a provision that doesn't [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2091.7200000000003s)]
*  let you regulate. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2093.88s)]
*  Like you were told all your life, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2095.6800000000003s)]
*  regulation is bad, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2097.36s)]
*  all regulations are bad, right? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2098.48s)]
*  But she's trying to allow for [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2100.44s)]
*  regulations at the state level, why? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2102.08s)]
*  because if you have an AI program [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2104.4s)]
*  that is totally out of control, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2106.2000000000003s)]
*  you're going to need to regulate it. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2108.0s)]
*  The answer isn't over regulation, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2110.52s)]
*  the answer isn't under regulation. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2112.24s)]
*  The question is, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2114.12s)]
*  what do we regulate, who regulates [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2114.92s)]
*  it, and why, right? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2116.8s)]
*  So in this case, she happens to be [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2118.6s)]
*  right about the substance, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2120.48s)]
*  should she have read the bill [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2121.84s)]
*  earlier, of course. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2123.24s)]
*  One last quick little thing, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2125.32s)]
*  she is also right that they do this [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2126.7599999999998s)]
*  trick all the time, both Republican [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2128.4s)]
*  and Democratic leadership. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2130.2s)]
*  We're going to vote on a bill, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2131.8s)]
*  it's like 4,000 pages, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2133.4s)]
*  you have 25 seconds to read it, go. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2134.8s)]
*  And if you vote the wrong way, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2137.92s)]
*  we'll mark it against you for [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2139.4s)]
*  the rest of your life and [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2140.6000000000004s)]
*  my primary, go. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2141.6800000000003s)]
*  And then by the way, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2143.32s)]
*  the stuff that they sneak into that [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2144.2000000000003s)]
*  bill, and by the way, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2145.7200000000003s)]
*  we'll be giving Israel another $8 [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2146.7200000000003s)]
*  billion for batteries for [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2148.6000000000004s)]
*  Iron Dome. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2149.96s)]
*  Anyway, vote now, go, go, go, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2150.96s)]
*  right? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2152.8s)]
*  So you get a kind of couple of [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2153.48s)]
*  public service announcements out of [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2155.0s)]
*  this, even though, yes, obviously, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2157.04s)]
*  she should have read the bill [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2159.2400000000002s)]
*  first. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2160.6800000000003s)]

*  I don't know who's going to win. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2220.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'm overall at the end of all [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2221.76s)]
*  of it, who is more correct? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2224.0s)]
*  That is what we're asking on [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2225.2400000000002s)]
*  twitter.com, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2226.72s)]
*  twitter.com, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2227.68s)]
*  Donald Trump or Elon Musk. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2228.68s)]
*  And on that one, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2230.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not positive yet either. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2231.56s)]
*  Let's go through the whole list and [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2233.04s)]
*  then decide at the end. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2234.48s)]
*  So Sharon is, of course, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2235.7999999999997s)]
*  going to help me do this. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2236.7999999999997s)]
*  Sharon, what's up first? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2237.9199999999996s)]
*  How did this get triggered? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2239.44s)]
*  Well, we'll start from [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2242.0s)]
*  the beginning, Cenk. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2243.2s)]
*  Trump made it official today, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2244.3999999999996s)]
*  public and couple. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2246.3599999999997s)]
*  That was Elon Musk, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2247.96s)]
*  President Donald Trump. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2249.04s)]
*  So in love at one point, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2250.3199999999997s)]
*  they are no more. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2251.68s)]
*  They're done. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2253.7999999999997s)]
*  Right now, they're both taking [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2254.7599999999998s)]
*  turns trashing each other publicly [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2255.68s)]
*  on social media platforms. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2257.6s)]
*  The ones that they each own, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2260.6s)]
*  of course. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2261.7999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2262.56s)]
*  the Epstein files are involved in [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2263.56s)]
*  this. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2266.0s)]
*  So we'll go there, Cenk. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2268.0s)]
*  Before we get into more details, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2270.16s)]
*  because it does get even spicier. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2271.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, great hype manual, Cenk. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2273.2799999999997s)]
*  Did you expect, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2276.08s)]
*  I guess the first question, and [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2277.2s)]
*  then we'll get into right and [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2278.7999999999997s)]
*  wrong, the breakup to end. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2280.2799999999997s)]
*  Did you expect it to be so [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2282.64s)]
*  quick, this demise of a relationship? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2284.48s)]
*  Yeah, so I thought that given how [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2287.08s)]
*  strong both of their personalities [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2289.52s)]
*  are, and how they both want to be [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2292.36s)]
*  alpha dogs, that a collision, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2295.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say was imminent, but [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2297.5s)]
*  very likely, right? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2299.84s)]
*  Did I think it would happen this [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2301.44s)]
*  quickly? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2303.04s)]
*  No, no, it's a little bit stunning [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2303.6s)]
*  what has happened. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2305.84s)]
*  The fact that it has devolved to [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2307.52s)]
*  the point where Musk is throwing [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2309.68s)]
*  about Trump being on Epstein files. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2312.6s)]
*  Whoa, okay, I mean, this got real. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2315.52s)]
*  So, okay, but it started with [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2320.6s)]
*  the budget, and [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2322.6400000000003s)]
*  Elon was mad about it for some [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2323.76s)]
*  reason, so let's explain that. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2325.48s)]
*  Yeah, so sitting alongside [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2327.52s)]
*  the Chancellor of Germany earlier [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2329.08s)]
*  today, President Donald Trump was [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2331.0s)]
*  asked about Elon's recent [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2333.0s)]
*  criticisms of the big, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2334.32s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2335.6s)]
*  And so that's what you're hearing [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2336.76s)]
*  in that first clip. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2338.7200000000003s)]
*  As a refresher though, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2340.2000000000003s)]
*  in a recent CBS interview, Musk [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2341.4s)]
*  expressed his disappointment with [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2343.4s)]
*  the bill, following it up a few [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2345.92s)]
*  days later with this post on X. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2348.08s)]
*  I'm sorry, but [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2350.92s)]
*  I just can't stand it anymore. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2351.84s)]
*  This massive, outrageous, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2353.4s)]
*  pork-filled congressional spending [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2355.2400000000002s)]
*  bill is a disgusting abomination. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2357.6400000000003s)]
*  Shame on those who voted for it. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2360.4s)]
*  You know you did wrong. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2362.88s)]
*  He goes on to say, you know it. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2365.1200000000003s)]
*  Now, of course, the President, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2368.32s)]
*  Trump obviously doesn't take [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2370.12s)]
*  criticism well, made his [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2371.84s)]
*  dissatisfaction with the Tesla CEO [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2373.2s)]
*  clear during the press engagement, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2375.2s)]
*  accusing him of self-interest, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2377.3199999999997s)]
*  being butt-hurt. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2379.3199999999997s)]
*  And this is what this thing [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2380.7999999999997s)]
*  devolved into. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2382.2s)]
*  What he didn't get his way, listen. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2383.0s)]
*  I've always liked Elon, and [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2386.7599999999998s)]
*  that's always very surprised. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2388.16s)]
*  You saw the words he had for me, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2389.56s)]
*  the words, and he hasn't said anything [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2391.16s)]
*  about me that's bad. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2393.16s)]
*  I'd rather have him criticize me [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2394.7999999999997s)]
*  than the bill, because the bill [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2396.4s)]
*  is incredible. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2398.2s)]
*  We are doing things in that bill [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2399.2s)]
*  that are unbelievable. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2401.12s)]
*  And when you look at what we're [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2402.56s)]
*  doing for small businesses, for [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2404.48s)]

*  nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2411.16s)]
*  And Elon's upset because we took [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2413.8399999999997s)]
*  the EV mandate, which was a lot of [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2416.04s)]
*  money for electric vehicles. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2418.48s)]

*  with the electric vehicles, and [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2422.8799999999997s)]
*  they want us to pay billions of [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2424.6s)]
*  dollars in subsidy. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2426.52s)]
*  And Elon knew this from [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2429.2799999999997s)]
*  the beginning, he knew it for [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2430.6s)]
*  a long time ago. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2432.3599999999997s)]
*  That's been, I would say JD, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2433.3599999999997s)]
*  that hasn't changed. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2435.64s)]
*  That's been right from [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2437.4399999999996s)]
*  the beginning, Mr. Secretary, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2438.68s)]
*  that hasn't changed at all, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2440.68s)]
*  right from the beginning. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2442.24s)]
*  All right, Cenk, so [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2446.72s)]
*  Elon was quick to dispute that. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2447.4399999999996s)]
*  We'll get to that, but do you want [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2448.72s)]
*  to weigh in now about the president? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2450.48s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2452.3199999999997s)]
*  So I'm going to score one for [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2453.2s)]
*  each side here. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2454.68s)]
*  So when Elon Musk says this bill's [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2455.72s)]
*  an abomination and it's going to [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2458.2s)]
*  add trillions to the deficit, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2460.24s)]
*  that is correct. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2462.16s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2463.12s)]
*  says that it will add at least [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2464.96s)]
*  $2.4 trillion to the deficit. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2466.56s)]
*  Why? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2468.6s)]
*  Even though it has $1.2 trillion [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2469.72s)]
*  in cuts to Medicaid and to SNAP, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2472.08s)]
*  which hurts, of course, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2474.3199999999997s)]
*  low-income Americans, it has [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2476.08s)]
*  $3.6 trillion in tax cuts, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2478.4399999999996s)]
*  the majority of which go to the [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2480.64s)]
*  very, very wealthy. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2483.04s)]
*  So since they want to give this [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2485.0s)]
*  giant gift of $3.6 trillion in tax [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2487.16s)]
*  cuts, and yes, it's true that [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2489.52s)]
*  there is also, for the moment being, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2491.52s)]
*  and we're going to come back to [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2493.96s)]
*  this a little bit later, tax cuts [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2495.92s)]
*  for tips and overtime as well, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2498.2s)]
*  okay? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2500.4s)]
*  But overall, the tax cuts make this [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2501.2s)]
*  so significant that, yes, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2503.76s)]
*  it's going to blow a huge hole in [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2505.76s)]
*  the deficit and the debt. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2508.0s)]
*  So score one for Elon on that, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2509.88s)]
*  that is correct, okay? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2511.8s)]
*  Whether he wants the tax cuts is [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2513.44s)]
*  a different question. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2515.12s)]
*  What he actually wants is [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2516.64s)]
*  a different question, but [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2517.6s)]
*  technically on those facts, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2518.6s)]
*  he's definitely correct. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2519.84s)]
*  Okay, now Trump says, well, look, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2521.04s)]
*  he wanted the electric vehicle [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2522.96s)]
*  mandate and we took it out of there. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2524.6s)]
*  Do I believe that Elon wanted the [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2526.56s)]
*  electric vehicle mandate? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2528.36s)]
*  Yes, I definitely believe that. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2530.04s)]
*  That obviously affects his company [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2531.7200000000003s)]
*  and later he complained about [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2533.52s)]
*  others getting subsidies, right? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2535.04s)]
*  Why are we not getting subsidies [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2537.04s)]
*  for electric vehicles, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2538.56s)]
*  if oil and gas are getting? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2539.68s)]
*  We'll get to that, right? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2540.88s)]
*  But is Trump right that Elon [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2542.04s)]
*  probably was upset about that? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2544.04s)]
*  Yes, is it right to give subsidies [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2547.04s)]
*  to those electric vehicles? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2549.36s)]
*  Look, the right and [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2551.48s)]
*  the left are both mixed on that. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2552.72s)]
*  The left wanted the subsidies in [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2555.16s)]
*  the first place, but [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2556.52s)]
*  now it's going to Tesla, so [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2557.52s)]
*  they caught feelings over that. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2558.76s)]
*  To me, the correct answer is take [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2560.48s)]
*  out almost all the subsidies that [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2562.56s)]
*  go to giant corporations. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2564.68s)]
*  Why is the average American taxpayer [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2566.96s)]
*  funding the most successful, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2569.76s)]
*  largest, richest companies in [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2572.52s)]
*  the world? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2574.24s)]
*  They don't need our money, so [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2575.04s)]
*  I would score that one for [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2576.64s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2577.8799999999997s)]
*  So, so far, we got a one-one tie. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2578.64s)]
*  All right, what's next, Sharon? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2581.3599999999997s)]
*  All right, so they're tied up. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2583.3599999999997s)]
*  Just want to get Elon's response to [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2584.7999999999997s)]
*  some of what Donald Trump said [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2586.7999999999997s)]
*  there, false. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2588.44s)]
*  This bill was never shown to me [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2589.3199999999997s)]
*  once, it was passed in the dead of [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2591.08s)]
*  night so fast that almost no one in [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2593.16s)]
*  Congress could even read it. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2595.24s)]
*  We know that's kind of true because [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2597.3199999999997s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene has admitted [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2599.16s)]
*  to not read the bill, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2601.12s)]
*  at least most of it. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2602.2s)]
*  Trump continued though, also [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2603.24s)]
*  claiming Elon Musk was but [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2605.2s)]
*  heard about Trump vetoing his pick [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2606.8399999999997s)]
*  for NASA head. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2609.0s)]
*  He wanted and rightfully, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2611.3599999999997s)]
*  he recommended somebody that he, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2613.2799999999997s)]
*  I guess, knew very well. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2615.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm sure he respected him, but [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2618.24s)]
*  to run NASA, and [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2620.2799999999997s)]
*  I didn't think it was appropriate. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2621.44s)]
*  And he happened to be a Democrat, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2623.6s)]
*  like totally Democrat. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2626.12s)]
*  And I say, look, we won, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2628.04s)]
*  we get certain privileges. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2630.08s)]
*  And one of the privileges, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2631.52s)]
*  we don't have to appoint a Democrat. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2632.7599999999998s)]
*  NASA is very important. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2634.8399999999997s)]
*  We have great people. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2635.96s)]
*  General Kane is going to be picking [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2637.4s)]
*  somebody with our, we'll be [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2640.12s)]
*  checking them out, saying, but [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2643.48s)]
*  he wanted that person, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2645.68s)]
*  a certain person, and we said no. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2646.68s)]
*  And I can understand why he's [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2649.24s)]
*  upset. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2651.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm doing some more explaining [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2654.48s)]
*  there, Cenk. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2655.92s)]
*  So, Elon was dismissive of that [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2657.6s)]
*  too. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2659.72s)]
*  He then posted a series of old [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2661.2799999999997s)]
*  comments from the president. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2662.8799999999997s)]
*  But first, way in there about NASA [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2664.3599999999997s)]
*  head, is that what this is about? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2666.44s)]
*  Yeah, so here again, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2668.2799999999997s)]
*  we got a split decision. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2669.52s)]
*  So, Elon is right that the bill [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2671.04s)]
*  came out and then they said vote on [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2672.8799999999997s)]
*  it right away afterwards. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2674.96s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene kind of [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2676.52s)]
*  hilariously said, well, oops, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2678.16s)]
*  I didn't get a chance to read it. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2679.7999999999997s)]
*  And there was a provision I really [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2681.24s)]
*  didn't like in there. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2682.3599999999997s)]
*  I gave her credit yesterday on [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2683.56s)]
*  the show for at least being honest [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2684.7999999999997s)]
*  about it, but [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2686.3999999999996s)]
*  she should have read the bill. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2686.96s)]
*  So anyways, overall, did Elon know [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2688.2s)]
*  that they were going to cut [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2689.8799999999997s)]
*  his subsidies? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2691.2s)]
*  He probably knew, even if he [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2692.08s)]
*  didn't read the bill. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2693.3999999999996s)]
*  That one is already a split [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2694.6s)]
*  decision, but I'll give it to Elon [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2695.8799999999997s)]
*  because it's true that the bill [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2697.3999999999996s)]
*  came out so late that almost [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2699.04s)]
*  nobody could read it in time. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2700.3999999999996s)]
*  The lobbyists make these decisions [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2702.7599999999998s)]
*  for the politicians anyway. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2704.2799999999997s)]
*  On the other hand, is it true that [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2705.92s)]
*  Trump would not give Elon the [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2707.92s)]
*  person he wanted as the head of [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2709.56s)]
*  NASA? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2711.2s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2711.72s)]
*  And was Elon probably upset about [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2713.56s)]
*  it? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2716.0s)]
*  Almost certainly, and he wants [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2716.52s)]
*  NASA to do more deals with SpaceX. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2718.48s)]
*  That's going to be a little bit [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2720.64s)]
*  relevant later in some of [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2722.48s)]
*  the exchanges. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2723.92s)]
*  And since Trump is not doing a [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2725.08s)]
*  favor to a donor, whether it's [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2727.32s)]
*  the subsidies or giving him [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2729.7599999999998s)]
*  the NASA head, I'm going to [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2731.84s)]
*  technically score it on the card [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2734.0s)]
*  here as one for each, but that one [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2736.84s)]
*  weighs heavily more in favor of [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2739.52s)]
*  Trump. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2741.92s)]
*  By the way, if you're on the right [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2742.56s)]
*  side, you think, okay, good. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2745.2s)]
*  He's saying Trump is right or [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2746.68s)]
*  Elon is right depending on the [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2747.7999999999997s)]
*  issue. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2749.0s)]
*  If you're on the left and [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2749.52s)]
*  you're saying, I don't like you [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2750.7599999999998s)]
*  saying that either one of them is [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2752.2799999999997s)]
*  right, one of them has to be right. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2753.7599999999998s)]
*  So if it makes you feel better, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2755.68s)]
*  you could just think, Elon is [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  wrong on that one, and [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2758.8799999999997s)]
*  Trump is wrong on the other one. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2760.04s)]
*  But either way, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2761.9599999999996s)]
*  it comes out to the same conclusion. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2762.68s)]
*  All right, let's go to [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2764.64s)]
*  the next round. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2765.12s)]
*  All right, so they're still tied [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2766.72s)]
*  up now to the old material, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2768.3599999999997s)]
*  the historical context, we'll call [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2769.7599999999998s)]
*  it, that Elon was giving on X. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2771.72s)]
*  Put it up, I couldn't agree more [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2773.7200000000003s)]
*  as he pulls up old statements from [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2775.44s)]
*  Donald Trump, talking about no [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2777.12s)]
*  member of Congress should be [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2778.7200000000003s)]
*  eligible for reelection if our [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2780.08s)]
*  country's budget is not balanced. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2781.48s)]
*  So that's got to sting in light of [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2783.0s)]
*  the big beautiful bill. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2785.0s)]
*  Remember this one? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2786.76s)]
*  Real Donald Trump breaking, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2788.08s)]
*  Trump just went to bat for [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2789.64s)]
*  Elon Musk outside the White House [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2791.0s)]
*  while examining the Teslas. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2792.88s)]
*  So Elon taking a trip down [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2796.52s)]
*  a memory lane, but he was pissed, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2798.4s)]
*  make no mistake about it, okay? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2800.96s)]
*  Whatever, keep the EV solar [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2803.76s)]
*  incentive cuts in the bill even [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2805.48s)]
*  though no oil and gas subsidies are [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2807.2400000000002s)]
*  touched, very unfair. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2809.36s)]
*  But ditch the mountain of disgusting [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2810.88s)]
*  pork in the bill. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2813.44s)]
*  In the entire history of [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2815.8s)]
*  civilization, there's never been [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2817.32s)]
*  legislation that both big and [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2819.96s)]
*  beautiful, everyone knows this. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2822.2000000000003s)]
*  Either you get a big and ugly bill [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2824.92s)]
*  or a slim and beautiful bill, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2827.1600000000003s)]
*  slim and beautiful is the way. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2829.28s)]
*  They're talking about bills, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2832.76s)]
*  politics, policy, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2835.48s)]
*  not something else. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2837.4s)]
*  But go ahead, weigh in on that, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2838.96s)]
*  Cenk. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2840.8s)]
*  Elon, furious, and so [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2841.32s)]
*  this goes on and on. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2842.92s)]
*  This one's a relatively clean win [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2845.0800000000004s)]
*  for Elon. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2846.88s)]
*  So first he mentions, hey, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2847.6800000000003s)]
*  you said that if you can't balance [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2849.36s)]
*  the budget, you shouldn't be [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2851.28s)]
*  reelected, shouldn't be president. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2852.88s)]
*  Well, Trump did say that, and [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2854.6400000000003s)]
*  Trump has never balanced [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2856.2400000000002s)]
*  the budget. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2857.52s)]
*  He had a whole first term, and [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2858.44s)]
*  he put over $8 trillion on the [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2860.2s)]
*  deficit, on the debt. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2861.96s)]
*  And it's more than any other [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2863.68s)]
*  president in American history, and [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2865.56s)]
*  he only did that in four years. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2868.0s)]
*  Now this would add, as we told you [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2870.3999999999996s)]
*  earlier, $2.4 trillion to the debt. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2872.3599999999997s)]
*  Now I don't know that Elon wants [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2874.64s)]
*  the real answer. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2876.56s)]
*  The real answer is stop giving [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2877.72s)]
*  away all the money to the rich. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2879.52s)]
*  Here, I'll give you one quick fact [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2881.8399999999997s)]
*  about that. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2883.64s)]
*  People making over $500,000 a year [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2884.24s)]
*  get a $1.7 trillion tax cut. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2888.04s)]
*  Just those guys. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2892.12s)]
*  Do they really need an extra [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2893.96s)]
*  $1.7 trillion? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2895.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay, that's what's causing [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2896.48s)]
*  the problem with the debt. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2898.12s)]
*  I don't know if Elon's willing to [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2899.7999999999997s)]
*  acknowledge that, but on the facts, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2901.2799999999997s)]
*  he is right. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2903.08s)]
*  This doesn't come anywhere near [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2903.68s)]
*  balancing the budget, and [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2905.72s)]
*  it never will. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2907.4s)]
*  This bill has a 0% chance of being [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2908.12s)]
*  balanced, no chance at all. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2910.64s)]
*  Write it down in stone, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2913.6s)]
*  I absolutely guarantee it, okay? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2914.84s)]
*  So now, but the bigger win for [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2916.88s)]
*  Elon here is when he's pointing out [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2919.36s)]
*  oil and gas subsidies. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2922.32s)]
*  And this is why I love this fight, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2924.48s)]
*  Sharon, because they're accidentally [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2926.56s)]
*  or on purpose just because they're [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2929.12s)]
*  fighting, exposing all the dirty [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2931.4s)]
*  laundry of both sides. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2933.6s)]
*  I mean, this much tea hasn't been [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2935.2000000000003s)]
*  spilled since the Boston Tea Party, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2938.1600000000003s)]
*  okay? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2941.4s)]
*  And so here, Elon is pointing out [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2942.44s)]
*  oil and gas subsidies. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2944.6800000000003s)]
*  You guys know that that's about [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2946.72s)]
*  30 billion a year? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2948.7999999999997s)]
*  We've been giving subsidies to [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2950.8399999999997s)]
*  the oil companies for [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2952.24s)]
*  nearly 100 years straight. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2953.24s)]
*  They're among the most profitable [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2955.16s)]
*  companies not only now, but [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2956.9599999999996s)]
*  in the history of the world. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2958.4399999999996s)]
*  And John and Jane Doe have to take [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2960.08s)]
*  out money from their paychecks and [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2962.16s)]
*  send it to Exxon Mobil, for what? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2964.4399999999996s)]
*  And they're not a new industry. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2967.24s)]
*  They don't need a leg up to be able [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2969.04s)]
*  to compete, no. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2971.04s)]
*  We give them all of these [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2972.72s)]
*  subsidies for no reason, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2974.24s)]
*  giant robbery. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2975.88s)]
*  So on this one, clear win for [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2977.44s)]
*  Elon, so he goes up 3-2. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2979.6800000000003s)]
*  All right, so 3-2, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2983.6s)]
*  corporate welfare, wow. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2984.84s)]
*  Things got even nastier though, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2987.52s)]
*  Jane, they did. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2989.08s)]
*  During the same press gaggle, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2990.2000000000003s)]
*  Trump decided to downplay must [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2991.96s)]
*  roll in his election win, listen. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2993.56s)]
*  We've done a great job. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2997.12s)]
*  Elon knew that. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=2998.84s)]
*  Elon endorsed me very strongly. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3000.1600000000003s)]
*  He actually went up in campaign for [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3001.88s)]
*  me. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3003.6s)]
*  I think I would have won, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3004.12s)]
*  Susie would say I would have won [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3005.28s)]
*  Pennsylvania easily anyway, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3006.84s)]
*  even if the governor ran, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3008.36s)]

*  not the governor from Minnesota. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3010.8s)]
*  I mean, he's a sick puppy, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3013.0s)]
*  that poor guy feels sorry for him. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3014.2000000000003s)]
*  Little diversion there to [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3018.36s)]
*  the governor of Minnesota. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3020.32s)]
*  Elon though, Trump claimed that he [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3023.2400000000002s)]
*  was suffering from Trump derangement [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3026.0400000000004s)]
*  syndrome, so let's listen to that. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3028.92s)]
*  I'll tell you, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3032.6000000000004s)]
*  he's not the first. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3033.68s)]
*  People leave my administration and [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3035.6s)]
*  they love us. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3038.92s)]
*  And then at some point they miss it [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3041.8799999999997s)]
*  so badly and some of them embrace [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3044.04s)]
*  it and some of them actually become [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3046.2s)]
*  hostile. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3048.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know what it is, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3049.56s)]
*  it's sort of Trump derangement [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3050.48s)]
*  syndrome, I guess they call it. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3051.7999999999997s)]
*  But we have it with others too, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3053.12s)]
*  they leave and [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3055.08s)]
*  they wake up in the morning. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3056.08s)]
*  And the glamour's gone, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3059.08s)]
*  the whole world is different. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3060.48s)]
*  And they become hostile, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3062.56s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3063.84s)]
*  Someday you'll write a book about [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3065.12s)]
*  it and you'll let us know. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3066.52s)]
*  I think he's talking about Elon [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3067.44s)]
*  like he dismissed his side piece. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3070.72s)]
*  Weigh in on this. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3073.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so this one's complicated [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3075.08s)]
*  because on the one hand, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3077.24s)]
*  he says that people leave and [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3079.08s)]
*  then they get Trump derangement [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3081.12s)]
*  syndrome, no, they leave with [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3083.56s)]
*  their hair on fire usually. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3085.68s)]
*  Because they're like, my God, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3088.0s)]
*  I didn't know he was that crazy, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3089.56s)]
*  right? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3091.0s)]
*  Usually the number one reaction. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3091.52s)]
*  People go in super right wing, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3093.92s)]
*  want to support Trump. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3095.48s)]
*  And they think, man, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3097.2s)]
*  this guy's got to figure it out. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3098.0s)]
*  This is going to be great. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3099.28s)]
*  They go in there like, wait, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3100.0s)]
*  you don't read anything? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3101.92s)]
*  All you do is watch Fox News and [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3104.2s)]
*  play golf and you're going to do [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3107.16s)]
*  145% tariff, you can't sell [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3110.24s)]
*  anything at 145% tariff. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3112.52s)]
*  You're going to knock it down to [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3114.68s)]
*  50%, it doesn't matter. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3115.7599999999998s)]
*  We can't sell anything at 50% [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3117.2s)]
*  tariff. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3118.84s)]
*  So if you're going to do tariff, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3119.4s)]
*  make it targeted specific, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3121.2799999999997s)]
*  long term, etc. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3122.88s)]
*  No, he won't listen to any reason. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3123.92s)]
*  So that's why everybody leaves, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3125.88s)]
*  frustrated at some point, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3127.56s)]
*  like, this is not good. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3129.0s)]
*  On the other hand, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3130.24s)]
*  is that what happened with Elon? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3131.16s)]
*  I don't really think so. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3133.0s)]
*  I think Elon is a different case. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3134.6s)]
*  I think Elon didn't get some of [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3135.92s)]
*  the things goodies that he wanted. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3137.3199999999997s)]
*  And then that's part of what's [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3138.7999999999997s)]
*  caused this problem in [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3140.4s)]
*  the first place. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3141.48s)]
*  A quick side note on Trump's [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3142.3199999999997s)]
*  attack on Tim Walls. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3144.64s)]
*  Okay, that guy got done so [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3146.7599999999998s)]
*  dirty, Tim Walls did. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3148.7999999999997s)]
*  Mainly by Kamala Harris, who [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3150.56s)]
*  largely kept him in a basement. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3151.9s)]
*  He's actually a populist and [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3153.44s)]
*  got a lot of good bills passed with [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3154.68s)]
*  the average person in Minnesota. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3156.24s)]
*  We have a shirt at shoptyt.com [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3157.88s)]
*  called Balls to the Walls, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3159.92s)]
*  which both Elon and [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3161.7599999999998s)]
*  Trump might want to buy now. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3163.04s)]
*  But he's on this Balls to the Walls [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3164.84s)]
*  fight. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3166.8s)]
*  But anyway, I like Tim Walls, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3167.8s)]
*  I don't agree with Trump on that, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3168.92s)]
*  but that's a side note. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3170.24s)]
*  And so, but one of the main points [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3171.48s)]
*  here that he's making is, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3173.48s)]
*  I would have won without Elon. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3175.04s)]
*  And I think he would have won with [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3176.92s)]
*  I think he would have won without [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3179.6800000000003s)]
*  Elon. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3181.32s)]
*  So I got a split decision against [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3181.84s)]
*  Trump on this one, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3183.84s)]
*  both for and against them. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3185.0s)]
*  So I'm just going to say that one [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3186.76s)]
*  is neutral. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3189.8s)]
*  So let's go to the next one. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3192.2000000000003s)]
*  All right, so then Elon's still up [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3194.4s)]
*  the three two, is that right, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3195.8s)]
*  Cenk? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3197.0400000000004s)]
*  Okay, I thought you would have [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3198.0400000000004s)]
*  maybe docked Trump a little bit, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3199.5600000000004s)]
*  shaved something off of his score [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3201.2000000000003s)]
*  for some of that. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3202.76s)]
*  But okay, Elon furious beyond. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3203.6800000000003s)]
*  So here's what he put up on his [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3206.8s)]
*  platform X without me, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3208.68s)]
*  Trump would have lost the election, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3209.8399999999997s)]
*  Dems would control the House and [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3212.0s)]
*  the Republicans would be 51,49 in [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3214.04s)]
*  the Senate, such in gratitude. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3216.2s)]
*  So remember, Elon did donate $288 [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3219.4s)]
*  million, you'd get thankful for [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3222.16s)]
*  that 2024 election. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3224.8399999999997s)]
*  And America PAC, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3227.3599999999997s)]
*  which Elon helped form, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3228.3199999999997s)]
*  that was huge, most prominent, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3229.68s)]
*  get out the vote campaign for Trump. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3231.56s)]
*  And now Elon is seemingly [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3233.68s)]
*  suggesting a full split from Trump. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3235.3599999999997s)]
*  So let's put it up. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3238.0s)]
*  Is it time to create a new political [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3239.4s)]
*  party in America that actually [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3241.24s)]
*  represents the 80% in the middle? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3242.88s)]
*  Okay, so these are fighting words. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3245.6s)]
*  But of course, Trump is going to [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3247.56s)]
*  have the last laugh and prove he [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3249.28s)]
*  will always have power over Elon. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3250.88s)]
*  So let's put up truth social. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3252.84s)]
*  The easiest way to save money in [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3255.96s)]
*  our budget, billions and [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3257.92s)]
*  billions of dollars is to terminate [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3259.72s)]
*  Elon's governmental subsidies and [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3262.28s)]
*  contracts, OMG. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3265.0s)]
*  I was always surprised that Biden [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3268.2s)]
*  didn't do it. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3270.76s)]
*  Okay, is he or [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3274.0s)]
*  because Elon dropped this bombshell. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3275.8s)]
*  Time to drop the really big bomb. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3280.88s)]
*  At real Donald Trump is in [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3285.32s)]
*  the Epstein files. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3287.68s)]
*  That is the real reason they have [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3290.32s)]
*  not been made public. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3292.6s)]
*  Have a nice day, DJT. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3294.16s)]
*  I don't know if we should pause [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3298.16s)]
*  there and keep going. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3299.28s)]
*  I mean, this is beyond hostile at [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3300.0s)]
*  this point. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3302.16s)]
*  But we'll give you a little more. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3303.64s)]
*  Somehow it gets even messier [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3305.0s)]
*  because Elon called for [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3306.76s)]
*  Trump to be impeached. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3308.24s)]
*  He's been through that before. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3310.08s)]
*  Responding to Ian Miles Chung on X, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3311.44s)]
*  he says, yes, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3315.32s)]
*  Trump should be impeached and [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3317.04s)]
*  JD Vance should replace him. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3319.72s)]
*  That was the tweet from Ian. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3321.6s)]
*  Elon hasn't stopped tweeting about [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3324.6s)]
*  this since Trump made those initial [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3326.84s)]
*  comments this morning. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3328.88s)]
*  But some other things worth noting [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3330.0s)]
*  he said include this. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3332.5600000000004s)]
*  In light of the president's [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3335.0800000000004s)]
*  statement about cancellation of my [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3336.48s)]
*  government contracts, SpaceX will [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3338.28s)]
*  begin decommissioning its dragon [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3340.28s)]
*  spacecraft immediately. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3342.32s)]
*  Okay, that's going to have some [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3345.6000000000004s)]
*  implications for some. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3347.4s)]
*  Back and forth, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3348.96s)]
*  the Trump tariffs will cause [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3350.0s)]
*  a recession in the second half of [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3351.6800000000003s)]
*  this year. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3353.52s)]
*  My goodness, this is a marathon. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3354.16s)]
*  Clash has also caused both Elon and [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3357.64s)]
*  Trump and their market prices to [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3359.64s)]
*  drop drastically. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3361.56s)]
*  Shares of Trump Media and [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3362.64s)]
*  Technology Group dropped 8%. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3364.0s)]
*  Trump coin down 12%. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3365.72s)]
*  Tesla shares dropped 14%. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3367.24s)]
*  Losing $152.4 billion in market [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3370.56s)]
*  value, the stock's biggest one day [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3372.96s)]
*  slide on record. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3375.2799999999997s)]
*  Can they even afford to keep going? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3376.6s)]
*  If they keep going at this pace, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3378.6s)]
*  right, using the biggest weapons [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3380.48s)]
*  they have against each other, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3382.48s)]
*  who loses first? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3384.6s)]
*  And will they both destroy each [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3386.28s)]
*  other like a nuclear bomb? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3388.0s)]
*  You know what this feels like? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3389.92s)]
*  This feels like that gas station [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3390.96s)]
*  fight in Zoolander, where they were [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3393.96s)]
*  spraying the gas all over each [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3397.2s)]
*  other and they light something and [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3399.76s)]
*  then right. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3402.64s)]
*  Hi. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3403.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of we've got [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3404.52s)]
*  a Zoolander situation on our hands [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3406.16s)]
*  here. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3408.0s)]
*  So okay, now there's a lot to [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3408.56s)]
*  break down. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3409.96s)]
*  So let me take it one by one. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3410.56s)]
*  As quickly as I can. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3412.32s)]
*  So number one, Trump, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3413.2000000000003s)]
*  Elon saying, I gave you basically [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3414.92s)]
*  $300 million. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3417.52s)]
*  He didn't mention the number but [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3419.0800000000004s)]
*  I gave you so much and [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3420.96s)]
*  this is great in gratitude and [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3422.28s)]
*  you wouldn't have won without me. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3424.2000000000003s)]
*  I think Trump would have won [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3426.8s)]
*  without him, although would have [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3427.92s)]
*  been harder of course, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3429.1600000000003s)]
*  the money definitely helped and [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3430.0800000000004s)]
*  the publicity and all that helped. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3431.4s)]
*  So did Elon help? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3433.0800000000004s)]
*  Yes, could Trump have won without [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3434.28s)]
*  him? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3436.0800000000004s)]
*  Very likely he won the popular [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3436.5800000000004s)]
*  vote, he won all seven swing [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3437.84s)]
*  states. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3439.0s)]
*  But most importantly, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3439.8s)]
*  no, as a big donor you don't get to [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3442.0s)]
*  say show me gratitude, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3444.1600000000003s)]
*  give me subsidies, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3445.6400000000003s)]
*  give me the head of NASA, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3446.92s)]
*  give me whatever I want. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3448.44s)]
*  It doesn't work that way. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3449.76s)]
*  If you like I backed Bernie [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3451.32s)]
*  Sanders and I didn't expect [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3452.48s)]
*  anything in return. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3453.88s)]
*  I backed him because I liked him [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3455.52s)]
*  and I thought he was the best [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3456.76s)]
*  candidate and had the best policies [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3457.92s)]
*  and the best chance of implementing [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3459.44s)]
*  them. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3461.04s)]
*  So saying that he's ungrateful for [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3461.8s)]
*  all of his campaign donations, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3464.0800000000004s)]
*  which I basically consider bribery [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3466.1200000000003s)]
*  at large is not the win that Elon [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3468.32s)]
*  thinks it is, I'm scoring that one [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3470.36s)]
*  for Trump or mainly against Elon. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3472.32s)]
*  So there is three three, then he [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3474.32s)]
*  calls for Trump's impeachment. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3476.52s)]
*  Look, I voted against Trump, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3479.84s)]
*  I think some of his constitutional [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3481.5600000000004s)]
*  actions or unconstitutional [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3483.52s)]
*  actions are terrible. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3485.32s)]
*  Sure have added haus, but [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3486.7200000000003s)]
*  they're not going to do [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3488.32s)]
*  impeachment. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3489.5600000000004s)]
*  So since it's just like it's just [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3490.7200000000003s)]
*  a shot fired, but there's no right [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3492.7200000000003s)]
*  or wrong there in terms of, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3494.8s)]
*  it's not like it's going to happen, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3496.36s)]
*  but I'm not counting that against [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3498.32s)]
*  Elon. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3500.2s)]
*  That's just a random insults, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3501.08s)]
*  nothing to score really in [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3502.72s)]
*  my opinion. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3504.0s)]
*  Then Trump says we should terminate [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3504.8399999999997s)]
*  all of Elon's contracts and [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3506.56s)]
*  subsidies. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3507.72s)]
*  Well, we already have a website for [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3508.56s)]
*  that, it's called wherezarkut.com. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3510.52s)]
*  Because we say look, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3513.16s)]
*  if contracts are one thing. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3514.2s)]
*  And so when Elon complains about, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3516.12s)]
*  hey, I got a government contract [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3517.7599999999998s)]
*  with Dragon spacecraft to go to [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3519.12s)]
*  the International Space Station, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3520.52s)]
*  that's true and [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3522.16s)]
*  that he's providing a service. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3522.8799999999997s)]
*  But when it comes to the subsidies, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3524.3999999999996s)]
*  again, I don't know why we're [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3526.12s)]
*  giving to Exxon Mobil and [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3527.68s)]
*  I don't know why we're giving to [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3529.0s)]
*  Tesla or SpaceX or anyone else. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3530.52s)]
*  So I'm not sure SpaceX is getting [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3532.52s)]
*  subsidies, but [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3534.12s)]
*  on wherezarkut.com we actually have [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3535.08s)]
*  all those facts for you guys. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3537.32s)]
*  You can look up each Elon company [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3539.36s)]
*  and we'll put the link down below [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3541.28s)]
*  later on in the description box as [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3543.12s)]
*  well. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3545.12s)]
*  And so I have a simple answer to [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3545.8s)]

*  Stop making the average American [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3551.56s)]

*  in the world. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3556.12s)]
*  And if we're going to do that, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3557.7599999999998s)]
*  the reason why it's called [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3558.8799999999997s)]
*  wherezarkut is, well, okay, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3559.72s)]
*  then if I'm investing into your [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3560.9599999999996s)]
*  company as an American taxpayer, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3562.3199999999997s)]
*  where's my cut? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3564.08s)]
*  Give me a portion of Tesla, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3564.8799999999997s)]
*  give me a portion of Starlink, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3566.52s)]
*  give me a portion of SpaceX, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3568.24s)]

*  and Chevron, then we could all be [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3571.3999999999996s)]
*  rich. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3573.16s)]
*  You don't want to give, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3573.68s)]
*  you only want to take. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3574.7999999999997s)]
*  I score that one for Trump or [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3576.3999999999996s)]
*  basically against Elon. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3578.3199999999997s)]
*  No, you don't get to have [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3580.24s)]
*  subsidies just because you're [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3581.64s)]
*  a donor. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3583.4399999999996s)]
*  And so then we go to the Dragon [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3584.0s)]
*  Space spacecraft. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3586.12s)]
*  Well, look, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3588.84s)]
*  Elon's got every right to say, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3589.52s)]
*  I'm not providing that service [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3591.04s)]
*  anymore. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3592.52s)]
*  And now how are you going to get [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3593.08s)]
*  to the International [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3594.3199999999997s)]
*  Space Station? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3595.16s)]
*  And I don't know what the answer to [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3596.0s)]
*  that is because look, there's so [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3597.52s)]
*  many things in our government [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3598.96s)]
*  that's a disaster and [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3600.3199999999997s)]
*  we can't get them to work. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3601.4s)]
*  So I don't know that that's [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3603.68s)]
*  a win for Elon though. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3605.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason why the [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3606.88s)]
*  stock price went down. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3608.44s)]
*  I mean, that was Tesla, but [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3609.6s)]
*  it's affecting all of his companies [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3611.04s)]
*  to the best that I could see. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3612.96s)]
*  And Tesla loses $142 billion. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3615.12s)]
*  So it's hard to give Elon [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3617.48s)]
*  the win on that. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3618.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes, he's technically correct. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3619.6s)]
*  He can stop that and [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3621.2s)]
*  it would hurt America's ability to [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3622.24s)]
*  the space station, but [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3624.04s)]
*  it's also hurting his own company. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3625.24s)]
*  So I'm going to call that one a tie. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3626.7599999999998s)]
*  And then on Epstein, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3628.88s)]
*  gigantic win for Elon on that one. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3631.04s)]
*  So, I mean, there's things that [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3634.24s)]
*  people just don't say in public, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3636.8399999999997s)]
*  even though they're super obvious. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3639.44s)]
*  Trump met with Epstein at least [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3641.84s)]
*  seven times, was on his jet, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3644.32s)]
*  I should say, at least seven times. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3646.6800000000003s)]
*  Met with him dozens and [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3649.84s)]
*  dozens of times, has tons of [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3651.56s)]
*  pictures with him, said, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3653.7200000000003s)]
*  the only person who likes a party [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3655.6400000000003s)]
*  harder than me is Jeffrey Epstein, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3657.76s)]
*  and he likes him young. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3660.1600000000003s)]
*  So, yeah, that might be a reason [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3661.92s)]
*  why they're not releasing [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3663.6400000000003s)]
*  the Epstein files. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3664.88s)]
*  I think there's another reason why [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3666.0s)]
*  they're not releasing the Epstein [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3667.4s)]
*  files, neither the Democrats or [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3668.8s)]
*  the Republicans ever released [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3670.1600000000003s)]
*  those files. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3671.6s)]
*  There's only one lobby strong [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3672.52s)]
*  enough to make sure that neither [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3674.2799999999997s)]
*  party releases those files. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3676.0s)]
*  If Elon Musk goes in that [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3677.48s)]
*  direction, Nelly, because that's [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3679.2799999999997s)]
*  a whole different level of nuclear, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3682.0s)]
*  right? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3684.68s)]
*  So he hasn't done that yet, but [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3685.64s)]
*  he hit Trump on the Epstein files. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3687.2s)]
*  And it's true that Epstein files [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3689.2s)]
*  have not been released, and [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3690.68s)]
*  Donald Trump was good friends with [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3692.0s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein, major win for [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3693.68s)]
*  Elon there. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3695.56s)]
*  We're tied at 4-4, maybe this is [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3696.12s)]
*  our last one, the recession. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3698.2799999999997s)]
*  So is Elon right that Trump's [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3701.3599999999997s)]
*  reckless tariffs will likely cause [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3703.44s)]
*  some sort of economic, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3705.7999999999997s)]
*  significant economic downturn and [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3707.2s)]
*  potentially a recession in the [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3709.2799999999997s)]
*  second half of this year? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3711.08s)]
*  Yes, I think that is likely to very [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3712.8399999999997s)]
*  likely. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3714.72s)]
*  So that puts Elon at 5 and [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3715.48s)]
*  Trump at 4. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3717.2s)]
*  Do we have any others, Sharon? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3718.6s)]
*  Look, we can keep checking the [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3722.2799999999997s)]
*  various social media channels [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3724.24s)]
*  because I'm sure they're still at [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3726.24s)]
*  it right now and [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3728.24s)]
*  we're monitoring it. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3729.0s)]
*  But can I just ask you, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3730.64s)]
*  this is fun scoring it as this [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3731.84s)]
*  like heavyweight bout with real [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3733.2799999999997s)]
*  implications, but my mind's going [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3734.88s)]
*  in some dark places. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3736.48s)]
*  Trump is reckless with information [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3737.56s)]
*  with secrets. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3739.48s)]
*  Elon was around in some key places [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3740.32s)]
*  just carte blanche walking through [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3741.96s)]
*  the White House. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3743.68s)]
*  I mean, what else can he do here? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3744.48s)]
*  He has all of our secrets. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3746.16s)]
*  I mean, he could release more, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3747.68s)]
*  he could do more. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3749.44s)]
*  And then I guess the second [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3750.7999999999997s)]
*  question I have for you is, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3752.36s)]
*  is anything dead 100%? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3753.88s)]
*  I mean, little Marco Rubio is in [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3755.32s)]
*  the administration, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3757.4s)]
*  JD Vans called Trump Hitler and [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3758.82s)]
*  look now it's his VP, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3761.0600000000004s)]
*  they're back in love. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3762.6200000000003s)]
*  Do you see any kind of [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3764.3s)]
*  reconciliation possible in [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3765.86s)]
*  the near future? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3768.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a great point. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3769.98s)]
*  So we should definitely end on [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3772.34s)]
*  those two things. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3774.1400000000003s)]
*  Number one, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3775.42s)]
*  can there be a reconciliation? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3776.26s)]
*  Look, this is super ugly, right? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3778.2200000000003s)]
*  Once you get to Epstein, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3780.2200000000003s)]
*  it's hard to come back from [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3781.6600000000003s)]

*  But Trump is a legendary [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3792.1800000000003s)]

*  Nobody flip-flops like [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3796.78s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3798.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm going to do 10% tests, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3799.46s)]
*  no, 145%, no, 50%, no, 30%, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3800.94s)]
*  back to 10%, wait, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3803.0600000000004s)]
*  we're pausing it, no%. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3804.5s)]
*  I mean, it goes on and on and on, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3806.34s)]
*  non-stop, that's the whole taco [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3808.1000000000004s)]
*  thing, right? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3809.82s)]
*  So it isn't Tuesday, but [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3810.6600000000003s)]
*  I guess it's Taco Thursday. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3812.6200000000003s)]
*  So could they go back to, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3814.82s)]
*  getting along? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3817.3s)]
*  Well, they could get to an unsteady [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3819.42s)]
*  truce and they probably will at [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3821.34s)]
*  some point. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3823.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, is this really going to go [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3824.34s)]
*  on for three and a half years where [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3826.2200000000003s)]
*  they're just bloodying each other [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3828.26s)]
*  day in, day out? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3830.3s)]
*  That would be awesome, okay? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3831.9s)]
*  But I don't know that we're going [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3834.7400000000002s)]
*  to get that lucky. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3837.3s)]
*  So it's hard to tell here because [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3839.2200000000003s)]
*  this is as brutal and bloody a fight [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3840.98s)]
*  as I have ever seen in politics. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3842.82s)]
*  On the other hand, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3845.2200000000003s)]
*  Trump is the biggest flip-flopper [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3846.1s)]
*  in politics and often changes his [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3847.98s)]
*  position. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3849.98s)]
*  And that's how he thinks you make [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3850.54s)]
*  a deal. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3852.7799999999997s)]
*  You do super heavy-handed insults [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3853.42s)]
*  and attacks, and then you reach [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3855.82s)]
*  a deal and then you go back to hugs [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3857.7799999999997s)]
*  and kisses. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3859.74s)]
*  So because of Trump, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3860.62s)]
*  it's not impossible that they could [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3861.98s)]
*  actually get back together. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3864.2999999999997s)]
*  Elon, not known so much for that, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3866.22s)]
*  more digging in is what he's known [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3868.82s)]
*  for, but they both have huge [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3871.42s)]
*  outsized personalities. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3873.62s)]
*  The second thing that you mentioned [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3875.98s)]
*  that's the most important of all [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3877.58s)]
*  is the budget itself. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3879.02s)]
*  Are they actually going to pass [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3880.5s)]
*  the budget? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3881.58s)]
*  What are they going to do with [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3882.34s)]
*  the budget? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3883.18s)]
*  So I know what Trump wants. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3884.14s)]
*  Trump doesn't care about the debt [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3886.34s)]
*  or the deficit at all, not 1%. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3888.18s)]
*  I mean, he's proven it spectacularly [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3890.1s)]
*  in two different terms. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3892.5s)]
*  When there's an opportunity to add [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3894.94s)]
*  trillions and trillions to the debt, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3896.82s)]
*  Trump always takes that [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3898.86s)]
*  opportunity, right? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3900.06s)]
*  And for Elon, my guess is he [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3901.62s)]
*  loves those tax cuts and Rand Paul [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3904.34s)]
*  is in his camp and Rand Paul said, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3907.34s)]
*  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3910.1400000000003s)]
*  we're keeping the tax cuts for [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3912.38s)]
*  the rich. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3914.02s)]
*  That's the most important part. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3914.58s)]
*  He's like, if I could just vote for [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3915.82s)]
*  that, I'd vote for it tomorrow. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3917.2200000000003s)]
*  Brother, that would mean that [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3918.58s)]
*  instead of adding 2.4 trillion to [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3919.98s)]
*  the debt, you added 3.6 trillion [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3921.5s)]
*  to the debt. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3923.1800000000003s)]
*  How does that make it any better? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3924.42s)]
*  It makes it actually worse if you [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3925.5s)]
*  voted on just the tax cuts. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3927.1800000000003s)]
*  So my guess is Elon wants the tax [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3928.82s)]
*  cuts, but he wanted his subsidies. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3930.5s)]
*  And even if you cut a bunch of [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3933.5s)]
*  subsidies and cut, here's the thing [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3934.7400000000002s)]
*  that's so frustrating, Sharon. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3936.34s)]
*  And again, not only does [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3938.38s)]
*  the Republicans not talk about it, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3939.6s)]
*  but Democrats don't talk about it [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3941.1s)]
*  enough, and the media almost [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3942.5s)]
*  never talks about it. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3943.7s)]
*  Why is everybody just cutting for [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3944.7400000000002s)]
*  Medicaid and SNAP, etc.? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3946.66s)]
*  So if you're MAGA and you say, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3948.9s)]
*  well, I want to cut for Medicaid, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3950.2200000000003s)]
*  and I want there to be [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3951.58s)]
*  a work requirement. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3952.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, but why don't you want to cut [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3953.62s)]
*  all of the corporate subsidies? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3955.5s)]
*  The corporate subsidies are never [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3957.78s)]
*  mentioned. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3959.46s)]
*  That's the hidden gem inside this [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3960.3s)]
*  that both sides are now finally [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3963.0600000000004s)]
*  talking about, right? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3964.7400000000002s)]
*  Where all of the waste, fraud, and [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3966.7000000000003s)]
*  abuse are is the corporate [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3968.7400000000002s)]
*  subsidies. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3970.2000000000003s)]
*  Donors give money to Trump and [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3972.2200000000003s)]
*  Biden, and then they get billions [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3974.28s)]
*  in returns, and sometimes hundreds [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3976.6600000000003s)]
*  of billions in return, right? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3979.0600000000004s)]
*  That's where the great American [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3981.38s)]
*  robbery is. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3982.82s)]
*  So are they going to take out [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3983.7000000000003s)]
*  the corporate subsidies? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3984.7000000000003s)]
*  I have it at nearly a 0% chance, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3985.78s)]
*  because the rich and powerful want [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3987.86s)]
*  their tax cuts and [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3989.94s)]
*  they want their subsidies. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3991.1s)]
*  What they'll probably do is cut [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3993.22s)]
*  more from the average person. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3994.82s)]
*  Now, there's a Republican senator [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3996.66s)]
*  talking about cutting from [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=3998.62s)]
*  Medicare too. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4000.02s)]
*  So they might cut more from [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4001.42s)]
*  the average guy. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4002.5s)]
*  They may take out one of the tax [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4003.62s)]
*  cuts for the average person, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4005.1s)]
*  either on tips or overtime. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4006.66s)]
*  But they're never going to touch [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4008.9s)]
*  the rich, and [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4010.3s)]
*  they're never going to touch [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4010.9s)]
*  corporations. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4011.94s)]
*  So my guess is, yes, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4012.94s)]
*  this bill will pass. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4014.42s)]
*  Yes, it'll get worse, not better. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4016.46s)]
*  And yes, it will add a massive [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4019.54s)]
*  amount to the deficit and the debt. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4021.34s)]
*  And then finally, Sharon, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4023.86s)]
*  of course it has to be noted for [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4025.38s)]
*  the record that, interesting that [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4026.98s)]
*  they were both keeping this dirty [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4029.06s)]
*  laundry secret when Trump, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4031.06s)]
*  I'll say anything, Elon, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4032.94s)]
*  I'll say anything. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4034.58s)]
*  Well, which they did prove today, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4036.02s)]
*  to be fair, right? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4037.66s)]
*  But back when they were together [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4038.7799999999997s)]
*  and they were allies, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4040.46s)]
*  they were planning that robbery [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bEV9MCHk8E&t=4041.62s)]
