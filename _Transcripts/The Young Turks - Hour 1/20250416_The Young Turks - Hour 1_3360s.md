# Independents Dump Trump - April 16, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=30.0s)]
*  The Young Turks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm your host, Yasmin Khan. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=33.12s)]
*  And I'm here with Wozni Lambre, but [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=35.32s)]
*  you all know Woz. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=37.14s)]
*  Woz, how are you doing tonight? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=38.04s)]
*  I'm doing fantastic, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=40.08s)]
*  happy to be on with you guys. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=41.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=43.04s)]
*  We have a patch show for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=44.76s)]
*  you guys tonight. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=46.28s)]
*  Cenk and Anna are both out, so [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=48.24s)]
*  that's why you have me and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=49.72s)]
*  Woz tonight. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=51.04s)]
*  But I promise it'll be a good time, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=51.92s)]
*  maybe. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=53.64s)]
*  I mean, the stories are a little [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=54.24s)]
*  crazy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=55.6s)]
*  But with that, without further ado, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  since we have so [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  many stories to get to, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=59.72s)]
*  let's roll the tape on this first [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  one. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=62.4s)]
*  He is not coming back to our [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=64.16s)]
*  country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=65.8s)]
*  President Bukele said he was not [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=66.96s)]
*  sending him back. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=68.8s)]
*  That's the end of the story. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=70.2s)]
*  If he wanted to send him back, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=71.56s)]
*  we would give him a plane ride back. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=73.28s)]
*  There was no situation ever where [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=75.52s)]
*  he was going to stay in this [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=77.48s)]
*  country, none, none. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=79.08s)]
*  He would have come back, had one [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=81.44s)]
*  extra step of paperwork and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=83.0s)]
*  gone back again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=84.34s)]
*  But he's from El Salvador, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=85.36s)]
*  he's in El Salvador, and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=86.68s)]
*  that's where the president plans [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=87.84s)]
*  on keeping him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=89.3s)]
*  So this morning, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=92.8s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi doubled [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=93.9s)]
*  down on Donald Trump's insistence [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=95.92s)]
*  that Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=97.9s)]
*  the man mistakenly deported to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=99.7s)]
*  El Salvador in violation of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  a judge's order, will remain in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=103.2s)]
*  a mass prison there, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  despite having never committed a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=106.64s)]
*  crime or been convicted of a crime. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=108.76s)]
*  But Bondi and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=111.44s)]
*  the Trump administration are facing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=112.16s)]
*  a fight because the federal judge [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=114.28s)]
*  in charge of Abrego-Garcia's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=116.0s)]
*  deportation case is not backing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  down. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=119.72s)]
*  Yesterday, Judge Paula Zinnis [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=120.64s)]
*  scolded the administration for [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=122.6s)]
*  dragging its feet and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=124.66s)]
*  complying with a Supreme Court [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=125.96s)]
*  order that directed the White House [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  to quote unquote facilitate [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=130.04s)]
*  Garcia's return telling a lawyer [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  for the Justice Department. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=133.82s)]
*  So here's what the judge actually [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  said, she said to date, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  what the record shows is that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  nothing has been done, nothing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=141.42s)]
*  Now she's ordered an intense two [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=144.72s)]
*  week inquiry into the Trump [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=146.76s)]
*  administration's refusal to seek [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=148.32s)]
*  his return. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=150.4s)]
*  So this is from the New York Times, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=151.56s)]
*  noting that every passing day was [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=153.52s)]
*  another that Abrego-Garcia, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=155.4s)]
*  a 29 year old father of three [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=157.2s)]
*  suffered harm in Salvadoran [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=159.02s)]
*  custody, the judge set up a fast [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=160.76s)]
*  schedule for officials to provide [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=162.76s)]
*  documents and sit for depositions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=164.8s)]
*  We're going to move, she said, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=168.0s)]
*  there will be no tolerance for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=169.8s)]
*  gamesmanship or grandstanding. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=171.48s)]
*  There are no business hours while [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  we do this, cancel vacations, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=175.92s)]
*  cancel other appointments. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm usually pretty good about [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=179.32s)]
*  things like that in my court, but [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  not this time, so [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  I expect all hands on deck. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  So she's not suffering any fools [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  anymore. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  Her ruling means that senior Trump [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=188.27999999999997s)]
*  administration officials will be [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=190.27999999999997s)]
*  forced to testify about their [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  failure to take action. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  And it's really not so [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=195.92s)]
*  much a failure as it is just [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  a refusal to take that action. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  It's willful and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=200.56s)]
*  obstinate subordination. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  But in a written order granting [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=202.92s)]
*  expedited discoveries and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=204.76s)]
*  as said, four senior officials from [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=206.68s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=208.88s)]
*  and the Department of State will [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=211.12s)]
*  have to sit for depositions by [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=212.96s)]
*  April 23rd, essentially out of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=214.6s)]
*  court interviews in which the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=216.4s)]
*  officials will have to answer [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  questions under oath from [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=219.84s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's lawyers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=221.36s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's lawyers will also [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=223.12s)]
*  be allowed to ask the government [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=225.24s)]
*  for relevant documents about [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=227.2s)]
*  the case. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=229.2s)]
*  At this point, three courts, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=230.28s)]
*  including the Supreme Court, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=232.12s)]
*  have ruled, the Supreme Court by [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  the way was unanimous that the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=236.12s)]
*  White House is required to take at [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  least some steps toward freeing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  Abrego Garcia. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=241.84s)]
*  But despite initially actually [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  admitting that he had been [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=244.76s)]
*  deported by mistake, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=246.28s)]
*  the Trump administration is still [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=247.56s)]
*  falsely insisting that he is an MS-13 [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=249.56s)]
*  gang member that should have been [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=251.88s)]
*  sent back to El Salvador. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=253.88s)]
*  And we talked about this on [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=256.08s)]
*  yesterday's show. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=257.44s)]
*  Those claims are incredibly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  misleading and the judge recently [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=260.2s)]
*  argued that the evidence against [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=262.0s)]
*  him was completely vague and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=263.76s)]
*  unreliable. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=265.2s)]
*  This morning when Pam Bondi was [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=266.4s)]
*  pressed to release whatever [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=268.32s)]
*  evidence they allegedly had, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=270.2s)]
*  she would not share any details. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=272.18s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  Kill Mara, Abrego Garcia and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=276.2s)]
*  Maryland, he's in a prison now in [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=278.0s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=280.2s)]
*  He was sent there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=281.3s)]
*  You insist the president to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=282.68s)]
*  everybody in the administration [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=284.2s)]

*  DHS said he would be arrested and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=291.2s)]

*  Why not show the American people [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=294.6s)]

*  evidence? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=302.76s)]
*  Well, he is an illegal alien who [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=303.76s)]
*  has been living illegally in our [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=306.36s)]

*  ICE testified, an immigration judge [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=311.2s)]

*  An appellate judge ruled, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=319.8s)]
*  he was a member of MS-13. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=322.08s)]
*  Hard stop, he should not be in our [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=324.92s)]

*  Again, that is not entirely [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=330.6s)]

*  watch our segment from yesterday, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=336.44s)]

*  box down below. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=340.24s)]
*  Was, we're going to get into [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=341.56s)]
*  the vice president's response to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  all of this in a little bit. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=344.52s)]
*  And it is truly, I think, unwell is [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=345.94s)]
*  the word I'm going to go with there. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=347.8s)]
*  But what's so baffling about this [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=349.68s)]
*  story to me is the fact that at [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=351.48s)]
*  first they sort of acknowledge [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=352.96s)]
*  their mistake, but then they were [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=354.6s)]
*  like, you know what, we just have [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=356.4s)]
*  to double down on everything. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=358.1s)]
*  Because I don't know what, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=359.68s)]
*  mistakes are weakness or if they [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=360.92s)]
*  admit to have made a mistake, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=362.48s)]
*  then it's like, obviously this is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=363.96s)]
*  the poorly thought out and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=365.8s)]
*  poorly executed plan that we now [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=367.18s)]
*  have to cop to. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=368.92s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=369.84s)]
*  Well, they fired the guy who came [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=371.2s)]
*  out and said, we made a mistake by [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=373.72s)]
*  deporting this person. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=376.44s)]
*  I think the only look, I don't [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=378.36s)]
*  know anybody in the Trump [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=380.68s)]
*  administration, I just go off of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=382.06s)]
*  what's actually out there in [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=383.96s)]
*  the public record. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=385.56s)]
*  And it feels like what they're [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=387.08s)]
*  doing is an attempt to have the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=389.8s)]
*  most muscular sort of outwardly [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=392.32s)]
*  powerful response to what I would [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=395.36s)]
*  say is literally the only mandate [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=398.52s)]
*  that the Trump administration has [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=401.52s)]
*  is that mass deportation or [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=404.72s)]
*  getting rid of the people who are [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=407.04s)]
*  getting rid of a lot of the people [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  that came to the country under [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=412.4s)]
*  the Biden administration is broadly [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=414.52s)]
*  popular is like a 55 to 60% [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=417.08s)]
*  approval for it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=419.0s)]
*  It's literally the only thing, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=420.44s)]
*  the only leg they have to stand on. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  And they think because of that, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=426.52s)]
*  they need to show basically a show [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=428.96s)]
*  of force that we will recklessly [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=431.67999999999995s)]
*  throw you in a freaking gulag in [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=434.24s)]
*  South America. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  The problem that they have is that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=438.32s)]
*  they have no credibility here. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  One, we know that net deportations [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=442.84s)]
*  are flat, meaning Joe Biden was [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=446.28s)]
*  deporting the same amount of people [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=449.44s)]
*  as the Trump administration at [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=452.79999999999995s)]
*  similar rates. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  And two, they don't have the goods. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=458.0s)]
*  All of these gang members, all of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  these violent criminals, all of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  these illegal aliens who are [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=466.04s)]
*  poisoning America's streets and [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=467.92s)]
*  making our children's unsafe and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=470.28s)]
*  threatening to kill our babies in [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=472.68s)]
*  their cribs, they don't have [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=475.04s)]
*  a shred of evidence. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=477.12s)]
*  The one guy they said was an MS-13 [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=478.68s)]
*  ringleader in Virginia. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=480.84s)]
*  They said he was like a kingpin and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=482.68s)]
*  coordinated this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=484.68s)]
*  All they got him on was a gun [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=486.04s)]
*  charge. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=487.24s)]
*  They got the governor of Virginia [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=487.8s)]
*  to show up to this guy's trial. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=489.68s)]
*  Basically, he was a show pony like [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=491.4s)]
*  look, we got a ringleader, nothing. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=493.56s)]
*  They don't have a wiretap. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=496.0s)]
*  They don't have pictures. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  They don't have snitches. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=499.12s)]
*  Fellow MS-13 guys that are like, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=500.56s)]
*  no, no, this was my boss. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=502.2s)]
*  They have nothing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=503.47999999999996s)]
*  And so all they can fall back on is [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=505.4s)]
*  this double down because they've [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=507.4s)]
*  been caught with their pants down. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=509.08s)]
*  There's just no substance here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=510.91999999999996s)]
*  And the crazy thing for them is [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=512.88s)]
*  that the one thing that is broadly [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=515.0s)]
*  popular about their entire [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=517.6s)]
*  harebrained agenda, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=519.88s)]
*  they are losing credibility on it [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=521.64s)]
*  by the day. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=524.28s)]
*  They're sending barbers. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=525.72s)]
*  They're sending makeup artists. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=527.76s)]
*  Instead of like, all right, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=529.6s)]
*  go to the jails where these guys [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=530.9200000000001s)]
*  are in county lockup. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  Or these guys are on Rikers Island [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=534.12s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=535.52s)]
*  And they're awaiting trial and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  it's for violent crimes. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=537.8000000000001s)]
*  I'll scoop those guys up. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  I bet you the country would be [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=540.36s)]
*  broadly behind even this crazy [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=541.84s)]
*  non-due process thing. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=543.44s)]
*  But they're not, they literally [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=544.96s)]
*  can't come up with these people. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=546.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I thought it was funny [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=548.6s)]
*  also and I mentioned this on [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=550.32s)]
*  yesterday's show. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  But they did have one instance [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=552.88s)]
*  recently of terrorism that was [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  actually reported as being [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=556.5999999999999s)]
*  terrorism in the news. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=558.28s)]
*  But that was that MAGA guy who set [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=559.92s)]
*  Governor Shapiro's house on fire in [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=562.12s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=564.56s)]
*  He was charged with terrorism. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=566.12s)]
*  So, I mean, they really just have [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=567.7199999999999s)]
*  to build this whole narrative [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=569.52s)]
*  around terrorism and gang violence. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=570.92s)]
*  Because they know that if people [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  are afraid enough, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=574.8399999999999s)]
*  then they will support things. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=575.88s)]

*  crime and the US courts have found [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=846.92s)]
*  that he was illegally taken for [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=849.92s)]
*  the United States. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=851.92s)]
*  And the government of El Salvador [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=852.92s)]
*  has no evidence that he was part of [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=855.92s)]
*  MS-13. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=858.92s)]
*  Why is El Salvador continuing to [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=859.92s)]
*  hold him in Seacott? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=862.92s)]
*  And his answer was that the Trump [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=864.92s)]
*  administration is paying El [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=868.92s)]
*  Salvador, the government of [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=872.92s)]
*  El Salvador to keep him at Seacott. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=876.92s)]
*  All right, so in addition to that, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=882.92s)]
*  this is reporting from the Hill. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=884.92s)]
*  It says Van Hollen said embassy [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=885.92s)]
*  staff members informed him that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=887.92s)]
*  they have received no directive [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=889.92s)]
*  from the Trump administration to [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=891.92s)]
*  make outreach on Abrego Garcia's [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=893.92s)]
*  behalf despite a Supreme Court [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=895.92s)]
*  order to facilitate his return. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=897.92s)]
*  So that was a crazy response that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=899.92s)]
*  we heard not just from the vice [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=901.92s)]
*  president but also from Senator [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=903.92s)]
*  Chuck Grassley. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=905.92s)]
*  Also, I think this is also coming [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=906.92s)]
*  up later on in the show, but [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=908.92s)]
*  Jesse Waters on Fox News said that [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=910.92s)]
*  this guy was obviously MS-13 [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=912.92s)]
*  because he was obviously wearing [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=914.92s)]
*  a Chicago Bulls hat or jersey, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=916.92s)]
*  whichever one it was, as if all of [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=918.92s)]
*  us weren't walking around wearing [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=920.92s)]
*  Chicago Bulls merch back in [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=922.92s)]
*  the 90s, right? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=924.92s)]
*  So ultimately, this is making [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=925.92s)]
*  Republicans look really bad. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=927.92s)]
*  We're seeing that backlash at these [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=929.92s)]
*  Republican town halls. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=931.92s)]
*  That was a Chuck Grassley town hall, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=932.92s)]
*  so you know that that's a very, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=934.92s)]
*  very red district. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=936.92s)]
*  So do you think Republicans at [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=937.92s)]
*  large are going to face any kind of [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=938.92s)]
*  backlash from their base over the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=939.92s)]
*  Trump administration's decision [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=941.92s)]
*  not to abide by court orders? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=943.92s)]
*  Because it really seems like it's [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=945.92s)]
*  bothering a lot of their [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=947.92s)]
*  constituents. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=948.92s)]
*  I think the minute that people [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=949.92s)]
*  realize that the impact of the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=951.92s)]
*  immigration stuff is business as [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=953.92s)]
*  usual, there's going to be a [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=955.92s)]
*  backlash. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=957.92s)]
*  I don't think it's particularly [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=958.92s)]
*  going to be because some guys got [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=960.92s)]
*  deported that shouldn't have. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=962.92s)]
*  I don't know that the Republican [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=964.92s)]
*  base really cares all of that much [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=966.92s)]
*  about due process for people they [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=968.92s)]
*  deem to be, quote unquote, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=970.92s)]
*  illegal aliens. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=971.92s)]
*  But I think when they do get [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=972.92s)]
*  around to noticing that there are [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=974.92s)]
*  no immigrants actually leaving [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=976.92s)]
*  the country, and I think JD kind [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=978.92s)]
*  of gives the game away. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=980.92s)]
*  He in his parlance in his [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=981.92s)]
*  statement when he says, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=983.92s)]
*  we don't have the resources. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=985.92s)]
*  We can't, bro, you guys have [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=987.92s)]
*  majorities in the Senate and [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=989.92s)]
*  the freaking Congress, okay? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=991.92s)]
*  Why don't you pass a bill [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=993.92s)]
*  appropriating more monies, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=995.92s)]
*  more resources to ICE so that you [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=997.92s)]
*  guys can do your mass deportation, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=999.92s)]
*  put more money behind it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1001.92s)]
*  You guys are, these guys are [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1002.92s)]
*  allocating a total of $1,000 to [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1004.92s)]
*  the US government, and [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1006.92s)]
*  these guys are allocating a [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1008.92s)]
*  trillion dollar budget for [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1010.92s)]
*  the Pentagon and [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1012.92s)]
*  the military industrial complex. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1013.92s)]
*  They're slashing benefits like [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1016.92s)]
*  Medicare, they're doing all kinds [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1019.92s)]
*  of stuff financially. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1022.92s)]
*  Up the ICE budget, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1024.92s)]
*  while you're at it, okay? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1025.92s)]
*  And if this is supposed to be about [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1027.92s)]
*  these allegedly horrible, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1029.92s)]
*  illegal aliens, why are we sending [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1031.92s)]
*  six ICE agents at a time to get [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1033.92s)]
*  Columbia students? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1035.92s)]
*  To deport them? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1038.92s)]
*  Why are we doing this to student [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1039.92s)]
*  protesters of a foreign country's [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1042.92s)]
*  horrific government's actions? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1045.92s)]
*  Why are we dedicating resources, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1048.92s)]
*  these precious resources, to [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1050.92s)]
*  activists against the Israeli [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1052.92s)]
*  government and [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1054.92s)]
*  their regime in the Gaza Strip? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1055.92s)]
*  These people have no leg to stand [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1057.92s)]
*  on, and the truth of the matter is, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1060.92s)]
*  I promise you, if these guys [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1063.92s)]
*  rounded these folks up and [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1065.92s)]
*  just sent them back to El Salvador, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1066.92s)]
*  Venezuela, people would be like, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1068.92s)]
*  well, that's what we voted for. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1070.92s)]
*  Instead, they're doing this fake [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1072.92s)]
*  show of force. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1074.92s)]
*  They're trying to look like tough [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1075.92s)]
*  guys, so they're sending them to [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1077.92s)]
*  these freaking prisons where people [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1079.92s)]
*  are getting dying all the time, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1081.92s)]
*  being beaten to death. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1083.92s)]
*  Sometimes they go starving. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1084.92s)]
*  They're sending these people to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1086.92s)]
*  concentration camps, essentially. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1088.92s)]
*  Instead of just doing the thing [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1090.92s)]
*  they were elected to do, which is [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1092.92s)]
*  people do want to see deportations, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1094.92s)]
*  but they're not doing that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1096.92s)]
*  So again, they have to do the show [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1098.92s)]
*  pony stuff in order to seem tough [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1100.92s)]
*  when realistically, again, go look [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1102.92s)]
*  at the deportation numbers. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1104.92s)]
*  They're flat. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1106.92s)]
*  Biden deported as much people as [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1107.92s)]
*  Trump did, which is insane when you [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1109.92s)]
*  really sit and think about this. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1111.92s)]
*  I mean, so much of this is insane. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1113.92s)]
*  There's so many different aspects [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1115.92s)]
*  of this story that it feels like [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1117.92s)]
*  you're being gaslit and just spoken [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1119.92s)]
*  to like you're an idiot this whole [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1121.92s)]
*  time, and you're like, what are [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1123.92s)]
*  governments doing? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1125.92s)]
*  This is coming from our elected [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1126.92s)]
*  leaders, which is yeah, it's just [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1128.92s)]
*  mind blowing the longer you sit in [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1130.92s)]
*  this space and I know for us, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1132.92s)]
*  we live in this space. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1134.92s)]
*  I know a lot of our audience [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1136.92s)]
*  members also live in that space. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1138.92s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1140.92s)]
*  There's so much going on right now [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1141.92s)]
*  to consider and yeah, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1143.92s)]
*  you're absolutely right. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1144.92s)]
*  This feels like a very fake show of [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1145.92s)]

*  They cannot look weak. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1148.92s)]
*  They can't back down from anything, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1149.92s)]
*  right? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1151.92s)]
*  The person that they deported [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1152.92s)]
*  should not have been deported, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1154.92s)]
*  which is honestly, it happens, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1156.92s)]
*  right? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1158.92s)]
*  Sometimes things happen, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1159.52s)]
*  things slip through the cracks, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1160.92s)]
*  even if you have such a tight [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1162.92s)]
*  operation running, one mistake [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1164.92s)]
*  that's understandable, right? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1166.92s)]
*  But once you find out that you made [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1168.92s)]
*  that mistake, you have to rectify [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1170.92s)]
*  what you've done, but instead, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1172.92s)]
*  they just have to double down to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1174.92s)]
*  the point now that they're calling [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1176.92s)]
*  things like due process into [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1178.92s)]

*  What the Salvadoran prisons are [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1181.92s)]

*  they're a lot of fun. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1189.92s)]
*  It's a really nice place to be. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1190.92s)]
*  People want to be in these [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1191.92s)]

*  by the way. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1236.92s)]
*  Virginia in South Carolina, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1237.92s)]
*  says we are a nation of immigrants. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1238.92s)]
*  What happened to we only want legal [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1240.92s)]
*  immigrants? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1242.92s)]
*  No, they just don't want brown [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1243.92s)]
*  people to come here. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1245.92s)]
*  And yeah, that was always [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1246.92s)]
*  the argument. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1247.92s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1248.92s)]
*  I don't have a problem with [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1249.92s)]
*  immigrants, only the illegal ones. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1250.92s)]
*  And then you ask these same people [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1252.92s)]
*  if they have any kind of [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1254.92s)]
*  understanding about what the legal [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1255.92s)]
*  process is to obtain citizenship [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1257.92s)]
*  or even to come to this country [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1259.92s)]
*  legally, and [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1260.92s)]
*  they have no concept of it. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1261.92s)]
*  It is incredibly difficult for [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1263.92s)]
*  the people who are trying to come [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1265.92s)]
*  here legally. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1267.92s)]
*  So maybe that's a whole nother topic [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1268.92s)]
*  of conversation. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1270.92s)]
*  Maybe we should revisit that [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1271.92s)]
*  process, but we know that with this [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1272.92s)]
*  administration and power, that's [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1274.92s)]
*  never going to happen. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1276.92s)]
*  Lobbyist for Big Four says, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1277.92s)]
*  I love this transparency in quotes [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1279.92s)]
*  of the White House. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1281.92s)]
*  I don't think the world has ever [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1282.92s)]
*  seen this kind of transparency. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1284.92s)]
*  Yeah, they say a lot of things, but [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1286.92s)]
*  it's not always the things that [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1288.92s)]
*  they should be saying. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1290.92s)]
*  Dirge says, this is going to be [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1291.92s)]
*  the standard Trump legal tactic. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1293.92s)]
*  Delay, delay, delay until the new [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1295.92s)]
*  cycle moves on. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1296.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of how it's been [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1297.92s)]
*  going for a long time. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1299.92s)]
*  I would say maybe for 10 years, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1300.92s)]
*  there's a lot of distraction. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1302.92s)]
*  There's a lot of delays. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1304.92s)]
*  There's a lot of just keeping [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1305.92s)]
*  people's minds occupied elsewhere [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1307.92s)]

*  He's very popular in El Salvador [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1375.92s)]
*  because he says that he's cleaned [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1377.92s)]
*  up a lot of the crime in El [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1379.92s)]
*  Salvador, he's not cleaned up a [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1381.92s)]

*  Service or DDS has shut itself [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1403.92s)]
*  down, effective at the end of this [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1405.92s)]
*  month. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1407.92s)]
*  The DDS has been referred to as [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1408.92s)]
*  the Pentagon's very own SWAT team [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1410.92s)]
*  of nerds, which is fun. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1412.92s)]
*  Before we get into why the DDS has [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1413.92s)]
*  decided to call it quits, here's [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1415.92s)]
*  some quick background information [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1417.92s)]
*  on what exactly they do or [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1419.92s)]
*  what they did really. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1421.92s)]
*  The Defense Digital Service was [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1422.92s)]
*  created in 2015 to help the Pentagon [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1424.92s)]
*  adopt fast tech fixes during [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1426.92s)]
*  national security crises and push [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1428.92s)]
*  Silicon Valley style innovation [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1430.92s)]
*  inside the Pentagon. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1432.92s)]
*  It built rapid response tools for [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1434.92s)]
*  the military during the Afghanistan [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1436.92s)]
*  withdrawal, databases to transfer [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1438.92s)]
*  Ukrainian military and humanitarian [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1440.92s)]
*  aid, drones detection technologies [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1442.92s)]
*  and more. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1444.92s)]
*  Without the program, some key [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1445.92s)]
*  efforts to streamline the DOD's [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1447.92s)]
*  tech talent pipeline and counter [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1449.92s)]
*  adversarial drones will be sunset, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1451.92s)]
*  one soon to be former employee said. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1453.92s)]
*  So it sounds, these people, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1455.92s)]
*  they sound exactly like the kind [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1457.92s)]
*  of people that someone like Elon [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1459.92s)]
*  Musk would want to actually keep [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1461.92s)]
*  around. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1463.92s)]
*  In fact, the only reason why they [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1464.92s)]
*  this hasn't happened sooner is [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1466.92s)]
*  because the members assumed that [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1468.92s)]
*  they would eventually be called [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1470.92s)]
*  upon to aid Musk in his efforts to [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1472.92s)]
*  streamline government operations, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1474.92s)]
*  integrate AI into government [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1476.92s)]
*  systems and overall just help the [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1478.92s)]
*  government to run more efficiently. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1480.92s)]
*  Jennifer Hay, the DDS director, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1482.92s)]
*  said simply, the reason we stuck [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1484.92s)]
*  it out so long as we have is that [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1486.92s)]
*  we thought we were going to be [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1488.92s)]
*  called in. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1490.92s)]
*  However, they soon realized that [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1491.92s)]
*  they were going to be called in. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1493.92s)]
*  They soon realized that Doge was [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1495.92s)]
*  really just trying to cut them off [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1497.92s)]
*  and shut them down. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1499.92s)]
*  And so seeing the writing on the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1500.92s)]
*  wall, all 14 DDS members, including [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1502.92s)]
*  the director, have chosen to [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1504.92s)]
*  resign with 11 employees opting to [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1506.92s)]
*  take Trump's deferred resignation [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1508.92s)]
*  package. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1510.92s)]
*  On the collective decision to [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1511.92s)]
*  resign, Hay explained, the best way [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1513.92s)]
*  to put it, I think, is either we die [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1515.92s)]
*  quickly or we die slowly, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1517.92s)]
*  which is very morbid, but [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1519.92s)]
*  it is what it is. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1521.92s)]
*  That is the state of the world [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1522.92s)]
*  these days. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1524.92s)]
*  So as for the disappointing [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1525.92s)]
*  realization that Doge isn't all it [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1527.92s)]
*  claims to be, one former DDS [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1529.92s)]
*  official echoed sentiments that I [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1531.92s)]
*  know we've been expressing here for [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1533.92s)]
*  a while on TYT. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1535.92s)]
*  They said they're not really using [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1536.92s)]
*  AI, they're not really driving [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1538.92s)]
*  efficiency, what they're doing is [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1540.92s)]
*  smashing everything. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1542.92s)]
*  Yes, we know. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1544.92s)]
*  So to that point, this isn't the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1545.92s)]
*  only tech or efficiency minded [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1547.92s)]
*  department that Doge has targeted. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1549.92s)]
*  According to Politico, several [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1551.92s)]
*  other digital modernization [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1553.92s)]
*  efforts within the government have [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1555.92s)]
*  met similar fates. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1557.92s)]
*  The US digital service, which helped [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1558.92s)]
*  the government modernize its [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1560.92s)]
*  technology and attract tech talent [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1562.92s)]
*  has now been subsumed by Doge. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1564.92s)]
*  Amid mass layoffs and firings, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1566.92s)]
*  a program called 18F, a technology [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1568.92s)]
*  unit within the GSA was eliminated [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1570.92s)]
*  by Doge as well. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1572.92s)]
*  As for the DDS functions, what [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1573.92s)]
*  they were actually doing there at [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1575.92s)]
*  the Pentagon, they're reported to [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1577.92s)]
*  be absorbed by the GSA and [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1579.92s)]
*  they're reported to be absorbed by [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1581.92s)]
*  the Chief Digital and [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1583.92s)]
*  Artificial Intelligence Office, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1584.92s)]
*  which is the broader department [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1586.92s)]
*  that the DDS fell under. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1588.92s)]
*  So this is very, very sad because [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1589.92s)]
*  almost all the people who at least [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1591.92s)]
*  spoke to Politico, what they said [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1593.92s)]
*  is that they would not have quit [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1595.92s)]
*  their jobs, they wouldn't have left [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1597.92s)]
*  their jobs unless they felt the [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1599.92s)]
*  pressure from Doge to do so. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1601.92s)]
*  And so they succumb to the pressure [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1603.92s)]
*  because as they said, it was going [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1605.92s)]
*  to happen now on their terms or [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1607.92s)]
*  it was going to happen later on [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1609.92s)]
*  Doge's terms. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1611.92s)]
*  So it feels good to have a little [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1612.92s)]
*  bit of power, I guess, wherever you [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1614.92s)]
*  can find it and just take it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1616.92s)]
*  But it's really sad to see though [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1618.92s)]
*  what's happening here and this [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1620.92s)]
*  particular department, I think is [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1622.92s)]
*  worth talking about because they're [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1624.92s)]
*  exactly the kind of department that [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1626.92s)]
*  Doge says they want to be in [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1628.92s)]
*  cahoots with, right? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1630.92s)]
*  They were doing the type of things [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1631.92s)]
*  that Doge says they want to do. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1633.92s)]
*  And so in eliminating this [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1635.92s)]
*  pressure, pressuring them to quit, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1637.92s)]
*  they're really just going against [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1639.92s)]
*  their own directive, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1641.92s)]
*  what do you think? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1642.92s)]
*  Obviously, I echo your sentiments. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1643.92s)]
*  There just doesn't seem to be any [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1646.92s)]
*  rhyme or reason to the Doge cuts. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1649.92s)]
*  I get it, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1652.92s)]
*  Elon went into Twitter, he fired [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1653.92s)]
*  like 80% of the staff. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1655.92s)]
*  People said Twitter would never be [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1657.92s)]
*  able to function that way. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1659.92s)]
*  And Twitter mostly, I mean, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1661.92s)]
*  it sucks as an experience, but [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1662.92s)]
*  it mostly does work still, right? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1664.92s)]
*  And so Elon can be like, you [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1666.92s)]
*  idiots told me not to fire all of [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1668.92s)]
*  these people, and guess what? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1670.92s)]
*  I fired them and Twitter still [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1672.92s)]
*  works, okay, cool. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1673.92s)]
*  The government doesn't work that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1674.92s)]
*  way, okay? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1677.92s)]
*  You fire a bunch of air traffic [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1678.92s)]
*  controllers, people will die. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1681.92s)]
*  Twitter doesn't work for a day, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1684.92s)]
*  okay, I can't get off some snazzy [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1686.92s)]

*  There will be tangible problems in [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1698.92s)]
*  American citizens' lives, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1700.92s)]

*  lot of kind of cybersecurity kind [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1707.92s)]
*  of stuff, again, no different. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1709.92s)]
*  The idea would be to be making [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1711.92s)]
*  these guys more efficient at their [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1713.92s)]

*  they're tasked to do, not to get [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1717.92s)]

*  of in line with the entire [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1721.92s)]

*  You take the kernel of something [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1723.92s)]
*  that broadly I think most Americans [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1725.92s)]
*  would support, just the idea that [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1727.92s)]
*  the government might have some [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1729.92s)]

*  We might be buying a surplus of [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1733.92s)]

*  Americans will broadly agree that [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1744.92s)]
*  the government perhaps is not [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1746.92s)]
*  going to be able to do anything [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1748.92s)]

*  the government perhaps some blow, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1753.92s)]
*  we should probably cut it. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1755.92s)]
*  They take that scintilla, that [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1757.92s)]
*  little kernel of truth, and [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1759.92s)]
*  do something completely ridiculous, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1761.92s)]
*  stupid, haphazard, and [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1763.92s)]
*  anti-productive, or [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1765.92s)]

*  Same with immigration, I myself am [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1769.92s)]
*  a first gen American, my parents, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1771.92s)]
*  all the people who raised me are [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1773.92s)]

*  I can understand people who in the [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1776.92s)]
*  in border towns in Texas and [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1778.92s)]
*  Arizona, places like Chicago and [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1780.92s)]
*  New York feeling like they're a bit [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1782.92s)]
*  overrun and overwhelmed. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1784.92s)]
*  They don't have the capacity or [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1786.92s)]
*  resources to help these people get [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1788.92s)]
*  adjusted in American life. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1790.92s)]
*  Maybe we kind of went overboard [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1792.92s)]
*  with the immigration stuff, we [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1794.92s)]
*  should probably send some people [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1796.92s)]
*  back. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1798.92s)]
*  Again, that's not my opinion, but [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1799.92s)]
*  I can see somebody reasonably [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1801.92s)]
*  coming to that conclusion. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1803.92s)]
*  And the Trump administration be [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1805.92s)]
*  like, all right, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1806.92s)]
*  instead of just being like, all [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1807.92s)]
*  right, we're going to do more [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1808.92s)]
*  border security. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1809.92s)]
*  People who don't have a legitimate [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1810.92s)]

*  seekers or whatever, who don't have [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1814.92s)]
*  a legitimate claim. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1816.92s)]
*  All right, sorry guys, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1817.92s)]
*  you got to go back to your country. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1818.92s)]
*  Instead, no, let's send these [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1819.92s)]
*  people with no due process to [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1821.92s)]
*  concentration camps and [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1823.92s)]
*  make a big show of it. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1825.92s)]
*  And on and on we go with [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1827.92s)]
*  the tariffs, you can say, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1828.92s)]
*  you know what, these trade deals [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1829.92s)]
*  from the 90s and the 70s, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1831.92s)]
*  they screwed American workers. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1833.92s)]
*  We want to bring manufacturing [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1835.92s)]
*  work back to America. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1837.92s)]
*  In fact, we need the capacity to [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1838.92s)]
*  manufacture stuff, especially high [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1840.92s)]
*  tech goods, if we ever get into an [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1842.92s)]
*  actual beef with somewhere like [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1844.92s)]
*  China, all right, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1846.92s)]
*  we need this stuff. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1847.92s)]
*  Instead, we get this blunt force [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1848.92s)]
*  instrument of tariffs across [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1851.92s)]
*  the board, no precision, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1853.92s)]
*  they don't take a scalpel, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1855.92s)]
*  they take a freaking sledgehammer [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1857.92s)]
*  to everything. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1859.92s)]
*  And I hate to be this cliche anti [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1860.92s)]
*  Trump administration person, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1862.92s)]
*  and call them stupid, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1864.92s)]
*  call Republicans dumb. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1865.92s)]
*  We're the smart side, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1866.92s)]
*  we're the brainy side. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1867.92s)]
*  I kind of scoff at that notion a [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1868.92s)]
*  lot of times when liberals or [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1870.92s)]
*  leftists take that tact towards [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1872.92s)]
*  the right, but I'm sorry, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1874.92s)]
*  this is dumb. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1876.92s)]
*  And when it's not dumb, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1877.92s)]
*  it's completely cruel. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1879.92s)]
*  This is no charitable way to look [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1881.92s)]
*  at any of this stuff. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1883.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to not call it dumb [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1884.92s)]
*  when actual experts like Conor [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1887.92s)]
*  and I have been in the room for [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1889.92s)]
*  a while. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1891.92s)]
*  And it's hard to not call it dumb [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1892.92s)]
*  when actual experts like economists [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1894.92s)]
*  are also calling this dumb and- [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1896.92s)]
*  Conservative economists, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1898.92s)]
*  conservative lawyers, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1900.92s)]
*  conservative commentators like, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1902.92s)]
*  guys, I want to run with Trump on [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1904.92s)]
*  this, I don't, there's nothing [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1906.92s)]
*  there, there's no sense. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1908.92s)]
*  And we all saw that chart and [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1910.92s)]
*  we had analysts look at the chart [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1912.92s)]
*  and they're like, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1914.92s)]
*  where do they come up with these [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1915.92s)]
*  numbers? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1917.92s)]
*  And also the numbers that they [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1918.92s)]
*  came up with, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1919.92s)]
*  just to get those numbers for [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1920.92s)]
*  one country would have taken so [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1921.92s)]
*  much research and [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1923.92s)]
*  so much data analysis. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1924.92s)]
*  And then they're like, here it is [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1925.92s)]
*  for 200 different countries and [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1927.92s)]
*  we just did it. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1929.92s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1930.92s)]
*  But actually, Waz, you did touch [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1931.92s)]
*  on something interesting. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1932.92s)]
*  That's how cults work, when they [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1933.92s)]
*  take some kind of universal truth [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1935.92s)]
*  or some sentiment that no one would [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1937.92s)]
*  argue against, something like, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1939.92s)]
*  we don't want our children to get [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1941.92s)]
*  trafficked, obviously, who's going [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1943.92s)]
*  to argue with that? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1945.92s)]
*  Or you say things like, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1946.92s)]
*  we don't want the government to run [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1947.92s)]
*  inefficiently. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1949.92s)]
*  Obviously, nobody wants their tax [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1950.92s)]
*  dollars to be spent in a dumb way. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1952.92s)]
*  That's all that our democracy is [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1954.92s)]
*  really built on. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1956.92s)]
*  That's why we have two parties. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1957.92s)]
*  We say, I like how that party is [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1958.92s)]
*  going to spend my tax dollars [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1960.92s)]
*  versus how this party is going to [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1961.92s)]
*  spend my tax dollars. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1963.92s)]
*  But then they take that and [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1964.92s)]
*  they say, you know what? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1966.92s)]
*  If you don't support everything [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1967.92s)]
*  we're doing, then you obviously [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1969.92s)]
*  love inefficient government, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1971.92s)]
*  which is crazy. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1973.92s)]
*  And everybody knows it's crazy, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1974.92s)]
*  except for the people who fall for [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1976.92s)]
*  that de facto cult. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1978.92s)]
*  Well, I'm being nice when I say [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1981.92s)]
*  that. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1983.92s)]
*  And it all just feels very [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1984.42s)]
*  inefficient too, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1985.92s)]
*  which is the irony of all of this. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1986.92s)]
*  In this particular case, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1988.92s)]
*  they're firing the people at [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1989.92s)]
*  the DDI or they're pressuring them [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1990.92s)]
*  to quit, right? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1992.92s)]
*  These are the people who are doing [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1993.92s)]
*  real good, tangible work, people [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1995.92s)]
*  who are actually doing things to [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1997.92s)]
*  help the government run more [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=1999.92s)]
*  efficiently, and they're helping [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2001.92s)]
*  to integrate AI into the government. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2003.92s)]
*  How does getting rid of those [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2005.92s)]
*  people make the government work [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2006.92s)]
*  more efficiently? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2007.92s)]
*  Also, just in general, even if that [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2008.92s)]
*  wasn't their specific role, how does [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2010.92s)]
*  getting rid of more people help the [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2012.92s)]
*  government to run more efficiently? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2014.92s)]
*  You're making more people do more [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2016.92s)]
*  work that they don't know how to do. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2018.92s)]
*  That's just going to slow [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2020.92s)]
*  everything down. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2021.92s)]
*  But you kind of touch on this too. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2022.92s)]
*  The government is not a business. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2024.92s)]
*  And I keep saying you're not [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2026.92s)]
*  supposed to run a government like [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2027.92s)]
*  a business, because the goals are [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2029.92s)]
*  not the same. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2031.92s)]
*  With a business, yeah, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2032.92s)]
*  efficiency is king, right? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2033.92s)]
*  You want to maximize your profits [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2034.92s)]
*  and you want to cut your costs as [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2036.92s)]
*  much as possible. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2038.92s)]
*  Nothing else really matters when it [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2039.92s)]
*  comes to a business. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2041.92s)]
*  But with a government, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2042.92s)]
*  you have to consider the people. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2043.92s)]
*  You are governing people. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2045.92s)]
*  You're not running a business. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2046.92s)]
*  You're not managing money. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2047.92s)]
*  That's a part of it, but [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2049.92s)]
*  it really is not the whole picture. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2050.92s)]
*  So anyway, I do want to get on to [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2052.92s)]
*  this next story. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2054.92s)]
*  So let's roll the tape on this one. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2055.92s)]
*  Some good news. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2057.92s)]
*  Independence feel that Donald Trump [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2058.92s)]
*  has vacated the center of the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2060.92s)]
*  electric catering to his base. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2062.92s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2064.92s)]
*  Well, let's talk about the overall [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2065.92s)]
*  net approval ratings. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2067.92s)]
*  We're going to look at the worst [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2068.92s)]
*  ever at this point in a presidency. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2070.92s)]
*  The old record among independents [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2072.92s)]
*  for the worst ever was Donald Trump [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2074.92s)]
*  back in 2016, a net approval rating [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2076.92s)]
*  of minus 16 points. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2078.92s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump has broken his [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2079.92s)]
*  own record here. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2081.92s)]
*  He now holds in this particular [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2082.92s)]
*  term, the worst ever net approval [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2084.92s)]
*  rating at this point in a [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2086.92s)]
*  presidency among independents at, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2088.92s)]
*  get this, minus 22 points. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2091.92s)]
*  I like this guy, I like his energy, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2093.92s)]
*  I like the way he talks, but the [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2095.92s)]
*  numbers get even worse for Trump [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2097.92s)]
*  when you focus on the number one [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2099.92s)]
*  issue, the economy. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2101.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2102.92s)]
*  Let's take a look at Trump's net [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2103.92s)]
*  approval rating on it and look at [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2105.92s)]
*  the trend line over just the last [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2107.92s)]
*  few months. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2109.92s)]
*  You go back to January, he was [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2110.92s)]
*  slightly above water with [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2112.92s)]
*  independents at plus one point. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2114.92s)]
*  Look at this drop, Kate, my, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2116.92s)]
*  minus 29 points. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2118.92s)]
*  That's a lot of points. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2119.92s)]
*  Minus 29 points, that's a 30 point [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2120.92s)]
*  drop in under three months of time. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2123.92s)]
*  As you go back through the record [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2126.92s)]
*  books, I simply put Kate Baldwin, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2128.92s)]
*  can't find anything close to this. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2130.92s)]
*  This is such a record that there is [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2132.92s)]
*  no historical analogy to be 29 [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2134.92s)]
*  points underwater on the most [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2136.92s)]
*  important issue of the day with [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2138.92s)]
*  independents. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2140.92s)]
*  This right here, my dear friends, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2141.92s)]
*  is political poison. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2143.92s)]
*  My God, no historical analogy, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2147.92s)]
*  political poison. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2149.92s)]
*  What is behind these shockingly low [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2150.92s)]
*  numbers? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2152.92s)]
*  You probably won't be surprised to [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2153.92s)]
*  find out that it is Trump's tariffs. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2155.92s)]
*  They are a huge factor in all of [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2157.92s)]
*  this because as I mentioned in [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2158.92s)]
*  the earlier story, there's no one [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2159.92s)]
*  else to blame but Trump for this [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2161.92s)]
*  one. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2163.92s)]
*  So here's more from Enten. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2164.42s)]
*  A clear plan for tariffs and [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2166.92s)]
*  trade among independents. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2168.92s)]
*  Look at this, 57% say no, he [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2170.92s)]
*  doesn't even have a clear plan for [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2172.92s)]
*  what he should be doing with [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2174.92s)]
*  tariffs and trade. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2176.92s)]
*  And when asked whether or not they [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2177.92s)]
*  like the idea of additional [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2179.92s)]
*  tariffs, guess what percentage of [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2181.92s)]
*  independents say no, that they [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2183.92s)]
*  oppose it? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2185.92s)]
*  It is two-thirds, it is 66% of [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2186.92s)]
*  independents who oppose new tariffs. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2188.92s)]
*  They don't like anything that's [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2190.92s)]
*  coming out of Donald Trump's right [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2192.92s)]
*  now, absent maybe immigration. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2194.92s)]
*  But when it comes to the economy, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2196.92s)]
*  when it comes to overall, when it [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2198.92s)]
*  comes to tariff, it's a threesome [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2200.92s)]
*  for negativity among independents. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2202.92s)]
*  They oppose, oppose, oppose. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2204.92s)]
*  All right, so those numbers might [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2207.92s)]
*  look bad for Donald Trump, but [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2209.92s)]
*  today Enten actually reported on [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2211.92s)]
*  some good news for [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2213.92s)]
*  the President, so let's watch that. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2214.92s)]
*  I hear all these stories, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2216.92s)]
*  all these articles, all the Trump [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2218.92s)]
*  voters, they regret what they did [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2220.92s)]
*  back in 2024, I'm here to tell you, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2222.92s)]
*  very few of them regret what they [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2224.92s)]
*  did back in 2024. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2226.92s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2227.92s)]
*  Trump voters looking back at 2024, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2228.92s)]
*  we got a new poll out, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2230.92s)]
*  the poll was conducted this month. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2231.92s)]
*  What percentage was it that [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2233.92s)]
*  they were not going to [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2234.92s)]
*  conduct this month? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2235.92s)]
*  What percentage would change their [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2236.92s)]
*  vote to a different candidate? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2238.92s)]
*  We're talking just 2%, just 2%, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2240.92s)]
*  that's not even a wide spot on [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2242.92s)]
*  the road. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2244.92s)]
*  And then you ask, okay, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2245.92s)]
*  the same question to Kamala Harris [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2246.92s)]
*  voters, and it turns out the [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2248.92s)]
*  numbers are rather similar. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2249.92s)]
*  So if there was a repeat, if folks [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2250.92s)]
*  got to be able to redo their vote [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2252.92s)]
*  that they had back in 2024, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2254.92s)]
*  would the result be any different? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2256.92s)]
*  I doubt it would be. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2258.92s)]
*  Well, in February of 2017, 4%, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2259.92s)]
*  4% of Trump voters say they'd [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2261.92s)]
*  shift their vote. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2263.92s)]
*  Actually slightly more than the 3% [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2264.92s)]
*  this time around. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2266.92s)]
*  Was I think on the left, we want to [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2270.92s)]
*  hear that these Trump people, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2272.92s)]
*  we want to believe that these Trump [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2274.92s)]
*  people are finally seeing the error [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2276.92s)]
*  of their ways. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2278.92s)]
*  And we are seeing some stories like [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2279.92s)]
*  that coming out on social media, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2281.92s)]
*  TikTok on X, wherever. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2283.92s)]
*  But on the whole, Trump supporters [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2285.92s)]
*  still very much support Trump. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2287.92s)]
*  They still believe that he's going [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2289.92s)]
*  to pull out a win at the end of [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2291.92s)]
*  the day. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2293.92s)]
*  Sometimes in our leftist bubble, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2294.42s)]
*  sometimes it can seem like that's [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2295.92s)]
*  not the case. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2297.92s)]
*  But the reality is that it's very, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2298.92s)]
*  very hard, especially at this point, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2300.92s)]
*  the way politics is so [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2302.92s)]
*  polarized in this country. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2303.92s)]
*  It is very rare to see somebody [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2306.32s)]
*  completely switch parties or [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2307.92s)]
*  completely switch ideologies. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2309.92s)]
*  And also there's the sunk cost [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2311.92s)]
*  fallacy that these people have [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2313.92s)]
*  invested so much of their time and [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2315.92s)]
*  energy, their entire personalities [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2317.92s)]
*  into supporting Trump. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2319.92s)]
*  That is a huge ask for [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2321.6800000000003s)]
*  people on the left to be like, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2322.92s)]
*  can you just switch over? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2324.42s)]
*  Do you finally get it? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2325.92s)]
*  Do you think that there ever will [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2327.92s)]
*  be a mass exodus of people from [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2329.92s)]
*  supporting Trump to not supporting [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2331.92s)]
*  Trump? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2333.92s)]
*  Or do you think that the left just [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2334.42s)]
*  needs to let go of that hope and [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2335.92s)]
*  move on and try to figure something [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2337.42s)]
*  else out? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2338.92s)]
*  I think there's a few things at [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2341.42s)]
*  work here. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2343.92s)]
*  Donald Trump is a singular figure [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2346.04s)]
*  in the sense that many of the [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2348.92s)]
*  people that vote for him, just like [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2350.92s)]
*  him personally, they don't care [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2353.92s)]
*  about what the policy is or [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2356.92s)]
*  how he's going to get there. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2358.92s)]
*  They just think he has a compelling [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2360.92s)]
*  personality, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2363.92s)]
*  it is a cult of personality. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2364.92s)]
*  And so again, folks got to remember [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2367.92s)]
*  Biden's fortunes didn't turn until [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2370.92s)]
*  nine months into his presidency. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2373.92s)]
*  After the Afghanistan war pullout, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2376.92s)]
*  which obviously all of us [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2379.92s)]
*  supported, but it did tank. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2381.92s)]
*  He got killed in the media for this [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2384.92s)]
*  and it kind of never turned around [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2386.92s)]
*  for us. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2388.92s)]
*  It's been basically three months of [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2389.92s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2392.92s)]
*  It's very, very, very early in [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2393.92s)]
*  the game. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2396.92s)]
*  Another thing that people have to [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2398.92s)]
*  realize as much as we like everybody [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2400.92s)]
*  experts, laypeople, normal people, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2402.92s)]
*  people with 401Ks, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2404.92s)]
*  people with stock portfolios. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2405.92s)]
*  Stock portfolios, etc, etc. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2407.92s)]
*  As much as everybody can recognize [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2410.92s)]
*  that these policy ideas, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2413.92s)]
*  especially as it pertains to [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2415.92s)]
*  tariffs in the economy are [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2417.92s)]
*  disastrous, the results haven't [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2419.92s)]
*  kicked in yet. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2422.92s)]
*  We haven't had mass layoffs yet. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2423.92s)]
*  We haven't had a stock market [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2426.92s)]
*  nosedive. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2428.92s)]
*  We haven't had tangible, okay, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2429.92s)]
*  material effects of Trump's [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2432.92s)]
*  dumbheadedness yet. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2435.92s)]
*  And so to expect people to feel [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2437.92s)]
*  like, this guy's been a disaster [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2439.92s)]
*  when nothing's tangibly happened [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2441.92s)]
*  yet. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2443.92s)]
*  No government agency that doge has [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2444.92s)]
*  cut funding to fail somebody yet. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2447.92s)]
*  This stuff hasn't happened yet. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2450.92s)]
*  There hasn't been some [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2452.92s)]
*  environmental disaster where the EPA [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2453.92s)]
*  could have stepped in and [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2455.92s)]
*  they didn't. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2456.92s)]
*  Or some kind of basically government [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2457.92s)]
*  over the top of the world, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2460.92s)]
*  or some kind of basically [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2462.92s)]
*  government oversight that wasn't [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2464.92s)]
*  in place because of doge. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2467.92s)]
*  Or people's stock portfolio and [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2469.92s)]
*  retirements get tanked. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2471.92s)]
*  This stuff hasn't happened yet. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2473.92s)]
*  And so I do think it's pretty [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2475.92s)]
*  early and I think another example [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2477.92s)]
*  to think about is George W Bush in [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2480.92s)]
*  2004, 2005 after destroying [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2483.92s)]
*  John Kerry, okay? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2486.92s)]
*  He got reelected, Republicans [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2488.92s)]
*  descended in both houses of [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2490.92s)]
*  Congress. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2492.92s)]
*  And it just looked like, wow, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2493.92s)]
*  we're going to be Republican from [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2495.92s)]
*  now until kingdom come. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2497.92s)]
*  And then what happened? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2498.92s)]
*  Disastrous war in Iraq, okay? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2499.92s)]
*  Bush got cocky talking about [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2502.92s)]
*  privatizing Social Security, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2504.92s)]
*  which obviously is a no-no. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2506.92s)]
*  Got creamed for it. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2508.92s)]
*  Katrina response, disaster. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2509.92s)]
*  And then on and on and on and [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2511.92s)]
*  until by the time Barack Obama and [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2513.92s)]
*  the Dems run against the [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2515.92s)]
*  Republicans, they're going to be [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2517.92s)]
*  the Republicans in 2008. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2519.92s)]
*  Like George Bush is widely seen as [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2521.92s)]
*  the worst president ever, okay? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2523.92s)]
*  He went from literally feeling like [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2525.92s)]
*  the Republicans were going to have [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2528.92s)]
*  majorities forever to this guy is [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2531.92s)]
*  a disaster to the point that we [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2534.92s)]
*  elected the first Negro in [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2536.92s)]
*  the history of the country, okay? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2538.92s)]
*  So folks need to realize that it's [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2540.92s)]
*  very early. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2542.92s)]
*  A lot of the horrible nature of [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2543.92s)]
*  Trump's policies have yet to be [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2545.92s)]
*  felt by everyday people. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2547.92s)]
*  But believe me, if this guy keeps [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2549.92s)]
*  it going with this China trade [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2551.92s)]

*  this hair brained, disgustingly [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2555.92s)]
*  evil immigration policy. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2557.92s)]
*  If he keeps it going down this way, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2559.92s)]
*  it's going to have an effect, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2561.92s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2563.92s)]
*  Yeah, I agree, but it is [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2564.92s)]
*  interesting because Trump [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2566.92s)]
*  supporters, they won't believe [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2568.92s)]
*  the bad things are happening until [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2570.92s)]
*  it happens to them directly. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2572.92s)]
*  So it's going to be a big [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2574.92s)]
*  disaster if they don't believe [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2576.92s)]
*  the bad things are happening [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2578.92s)]
*  directly sometimes, right? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2580.92s)]
*  They don't think that the economy [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2582.92s)]
*  tanking is a problem because their [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2584.92s)]
*  portfolios haven't been hit or [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2586.92s)]
*  their bank accounts or whatever. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2588.92s)]
*  But they will believe that [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2590.92s)]
*  terrorists are just running [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2591.92s)]
*  rampant around the country even [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2592.92s)]
*  though there hasn't been any [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2593.92s)]
*  reported terrorism, even though [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2594.92s)]
*  they haven't seen any terrorists, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2596.92s)]
*  or even though they haven't been [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2598.92s)]
*  personally terrorized by anyone, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2600.92s)]
*  really. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2602.92s)]
*  So they just pick and choose [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2603.92s)]
*  things. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2604.92s)]
*  Trump's personality, right? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2605.92s)]
*  They have to support him. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2606.92s)]
*  We're even seeing it from members [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2608.92s)]
*  of Congress, right? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2610.92s)]
*  Where they come out not to defend [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2611.92s)]
*  democracy, not to defend the [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2613.92s)]
*  country, not to defend their [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2615.92s)]
*  constituents, but to defend [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2617.92s)]
*  the president. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2619.92s)]
*  That's not how this country is [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2620.92s)]
*  supposed to work. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2621.92s)]
*  And the Republicans, they do need [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2622.92s)]
*  to seriously start thinking about [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2623.92s)]
*  what's going to happen if and when [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2624.92s)]
*  this guy is out of there because [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2626.92s)]
*  presumably he'll be out of there [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2628.92s)]
*  within the next four years. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2630.92s)]
*  I guess we'll see what happens [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2632.92s)]
*  there. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2633.92s)]
*  We do need to take our next break, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2634.92s)]
*  so we will be right back. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2636.92s)]

*  Was in the comments. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2650.92s)]
*  Art guy says, well, this giant [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2652.92s)]
*  mural isn't going to finish [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2654.92s)]
*  itself, so I'll listen while I [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2655.92s)]
*  work. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2656.92s)]
*  Stay strong, everyone. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2657.92s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2658.92s)]
*  I wish I could paint. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2659.92s)]
*  I can't paint. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2660.92s)]
*  I paint my walls, but [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2661.92s)]
*  there's no way I can paint. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2662.92s)]
*  I paint my walls, but [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2663.92s)]
*  there's no murals on it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2664.92s)]
*  But it would be really cool to see [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2665.92s)]
*  what you're working on. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2667.92s)]
*  Ian Goldbiss says, the problem with [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2669.92s)]
*  this country is we have people who [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2671.92s)]
*  believe Musk is doing productive [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2673.92s)]
*  work, and I think that is a very [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2675.92s)]
*  encompassing statement to have made [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2677.92s)]
*  because that is a big part of the [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2679.92s)]
*  country, a big part of the problem [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2681.92s)]
*  in this country because it says so [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2683.92s)]
*  much about the things that we [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2685.92s)]

*  about the people in charge and [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2689.92s)]
*  people still fall for people like [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2691.92s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2693.92s)]
*  Trump Loi, he says, that's how it's [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2694.92s)]

*  underwater even from the standpoint [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2705.92s)]
*  of water? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2707.92s)]
*  This is a very good question. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2708.92s)]
*  We will ask Was, I mean, I'm sorry, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2710.92s)]
*  we'll ask the water, Was. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2712.92s)]

*  Will Trump gaslight America when it [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2725.92s)]
*  counts for him? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2727.92s)]
*  Likely, and yeah, I mean, we all [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2728.92s)]
*  expect an October surprise, right? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2731.92s)]
*  We all know that Trump is doing all [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2734.92s)]
*  this stuff at the very, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2736.92s)]
*  very beginning of his term. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2737.92s)]
*  I think Was was kind of alluding to [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2738.92s)]
*  this also when he was speaking. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2740.92s)]
*  He's doing all this right as soon [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2742.92s)]
*  as he gets into office because he's [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2744.92s)]
*  hoping that things will balance out [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2746.92s)]
*  by time election season comes up, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2748.92s)]
*  even though he's not supposed to be [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2750.92s)]
*  reelected. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2752.92s)]
*  He's not supposed to be up for [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2753.92s)]
*  reelection, but not just for him, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2754.92s)]
*  but for the sake of the entire [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2756.92s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2757.92s)]
*  I think they're all hoping that [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2758.92s)]
*  this gamble pays off, or [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2760.92s)]
*  they're just going to pretend like [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2761.92s)]
*  it did even if it didn't. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2762.92s)]
*  So the verbose dragon says, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2763.92s)]
*  does anyone else want to see the [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2767.92s)]

*  yeeting themselves off a cliff? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2771.92s)]
*  Seeing the steep angles would be so [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2773.92s)]
*  much more satisfying than [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2775.92s)]
*  the numbers. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2776.92s)]
*  That would be more fun. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2777.92s)]

*  But let's get into this next story. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2816.92s)]
*  New data coming out from the US [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2819.92s)]
*  government yesterday that showed [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2821.92s)]
*  a 10% drop in March of non-citizens [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2823.92s)]
*  arriving at US airports. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2825.92s)]
*  And it won't surprise you probably [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2827.92s)]
*  to know that the biggest year over [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2829.92s)]
*  year declines were from Canadian [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2831.92s)]
*  people flying in from Mexico and [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2833.92s)]
*  from Europe. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2835.92s)]
*  All right, so as part of the [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2836.92s)]
*  fallout from Trump's tariffs as [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2838.92s)]
*  well as his incessant provocation [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2840.92s)]
*  of the Canadian people, i.e. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2842.92s)]
*  his threats to annex them and [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2844.92s)]
*  his accusations that they are [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2846.92s)]
*  funneling fentanyl into our country, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2848.92s)]
*  etc, etc. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2850.92s)]
*  Travel into the US from foreign [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2851.92s)]
*  countries, specifically Canada, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2853.92s)]
*  Mexico and Europe is down in a very [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2855.92s)]
*  big way. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2857.92s)]
*  So big in fact that according to [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2858.92s)]
*  experts, the US economy is [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2860.92s)]
*  expected to lose billions of [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2862.92s)]
*  dollars in 2025 and lost revenue [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2864.92s)]
*  from tourism and boycotts of [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2866.92s)]
*  American products. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2868.92s)]
*  Last month arrivals of non-citizens [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2869.92s)]
*  into the US by plane dropped by [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2871.92s)]
*  almost 10%. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2873.92s)]
*  Also Goldman Sachs has estimated [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2874.92s)]
*  that in the worst case scenario, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2876.92s)]
*  accounting for both travel and [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2878.92s)]
*  purchasing boycotts, the US could [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2880.92s)]
*  see a total hit of 0.3% to gross [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2882.92s)]
*  domestic product which translates [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2884.92s)]
*  into a $1.5 billion in gross [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2886.92s)]
*  domestic product. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2888.92s)]
*  Which translates into a whopping [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2890.92s)]
*  $90 billion loss. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2892.92s)]
*  The 0.3% doesn't sound like a lot [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2893.92s)]
*  but it's $90 billion. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2895.92s)]
*  According to the International [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2896.92s)]
*  Trade Administration or the ITA, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2898.92s)]
*  the US took in a record $254 billion [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2900.92s)]
*  last year from international [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2902.92s)]
*  travelers. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2904.92s)]
*  And prior to all of this Trump [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2905.92s)]
*  drama that we're experiencing right [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2907.92s)]
*  now, projections for 2025 and [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2910.92s)]
*  2026 were expected to meet and [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2912.92s)]
*  then exceed pre-pandemic levels of [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2914.92s)]
*  travel. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2916.92s)]
*  So the US economy is down in a [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2917.92s)]
*  pre-pandemic levels of travel from [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2919.92s)]
*  non-citizens. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2921.92s)]
*  And we're already starting to see [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2922.92s)]
*  the effects starting to play out. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2924.92s)]
*  In March, hotel rates and airfares [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2926.92s)]
*  and car rental costs, those all [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2928.92s)]
*  dropped and the Northeast was hit [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2930.92s)]
*  particularly hard, presumably [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2932.92s)]
*  because Canadians aren't visiting [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2934.92s)]
*  that region anymore. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2936.92s)]
*  So looking ahead to this summer, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2937.92s)]
*  Canadian flight reservations to [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2939.92s)]
*  the US are down 70% through [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2941.92s)]
*  September compared to the same [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2943.92s)]
*  period last year. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2945.92s)]
*  And Europe to US booking of [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2946.92s)]
*  bookings are down 25%. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2948.92s)]
*  Reports of longer wait times at [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2950.92s)]
*  customs and immigration, as well as [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2952.92s)]
*  stories of detentions like harsh [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2954.92s)]
*  detentions of European travelers in [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2956.92s)]
*  American airports could also be [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2958.92s)]
*  contributing to these declining [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2960.92s)]
*  air sales. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2962.92s)]
*  And business travel also looks to [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2963.92s)]
*  be impacted, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2965.92s)]
*  it's not just pleasure travel. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2966.92s)]
*  So let's look at that. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2968.92s)]
*  But we've also recently seen moves [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2970.92s)]
*  in corporate travel start to show [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2972.92s)]
*  up. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2974.92s)]
*  We reported last night and [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2975.92s)]
*  yesterday afternoon that AIMCO, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2977.92s)]
*  the Alberta Pension Fund, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2979.92s)]
*  has told its staff that it will be [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2981.92s)]
*  curbing trips to the US. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2983.92s)]
*  They'll be able to go for some [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2985.92s)]
*  reasons but not for conferences and [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2987.92s)]
*  speaking engagements. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2989.92s)]
*  And last night we reported that [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2990.92s)]
*  the Children's Hospital of Eastern [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2992.92s)]
*  Ontario, a pretty major research [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2994.92s)]
*  hospital in Canada, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2996.92s)]
*  has advised the staff not to go to [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2997.92s)]
*  the US and has given them all [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=2999.92s)]
*  sorts of advice about how to get [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3001.92s)]
*  to the US. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3003.92s)]
*  They've given them all sorts of [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3004.92s)]
*  advice about what to do if they do [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3006.92s)]
*  have to go to the US in terms of [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3008.92s)]
*  cleaning up their laptop and taking [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3010.92s)]
*  a burner phone that doesn't have [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3012.92s)]
*  your personal data on it. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3014.92s)]
*  It's somewhat hard to believe we're [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3016.92s)]
*  talking about this in the realm of [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3018.92s)]
*  Canadian US travel, but that's [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3020.92s)]
*  where we are. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3022.92s)]
*  And as long as people remain [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3023.92s)]
*  concerned, likely these numbers [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3025.92s)]
*  are going to be solved. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3027.92s)]
*  Well, I think this is really sad. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3028.92s)]
*  I love Canada, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3030.92s)]
*  I love visiting Canada. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3031.92s)]
*  I go to Canada a lot actually, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3032.92s)]
*  because I have a lot of family [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3033.92s)]
*  there. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3034.92s)]
*  And was I'm originally from [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3035.92s)]
*  Connecticut and so when I was [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3036.92s)]
*  younger, we used to just drive up [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3037.92s)]
*  to Toronto all the time. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3038.92s)]
*  I've seen Niagara Falls so [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3040.92s)]
*  many times, more times than anyone [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3041.92s)]
*  needs to see this one particular [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3043.92s)]
*  waterfall, but I've been to Niagara [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3045.92s)]
*  Falls so many times. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3047.92s)]
*  And it is sad, but I can't say that [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3048.92s)]
*  I blame the Canadians for not [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3050.92s)]
*  wanting to come to the United [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3051.92s)]
*  States anymore. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3052.92s)]
*  The reasons as to why all this is [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3053.92s)]
*  happening is very obvious. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3055.92s)]
*  But was do you think that Trump [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3057.92s)]
*  considered that this might happen? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3059.92s)]
*  That this might be like a side [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3061.92s)]
*  effect when he was rolling out all [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3062.92s)]
*  these tariffs and bullying other [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3064.92s)]
*  countries, especially when he was [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3066.92s)]
*  antagonizing the Canadians? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3068.92s)]
*  They're right there, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3070.92s)]
*  why would you be so mean to them? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3071.92s)]
*  And it's such a beautiful country [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3072.92s)]
*  too. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3073.92s)]
*  Or do you think this is just part [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3074.92s)]
*  of the short term pain before we [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3076.92s)]
*  get to see the long term gain that [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3078.92s)]
*  he keeps promising us? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3080.92s)]
*  No, he didn't consider it. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3082.92s)]
*  And no, nobody on his team pushed [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3084.92s)]
*  back. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3086.92s)]
*  Stephen Miller is in charge of his [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3087.92s)]
*  immigration regime, right? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3089.92s)]
*  This guy is a maximalist, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3091.92s)]
*  anti-immigration person. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3093.92s)]
*  So no, nobody brought this to [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3096.92s)]
*  attention. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3098.92s)]
*  I don't think Trump actually gives [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3099.92s)]
*  a damn about any of this. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3101.92s)]
*  I think he does have some level of [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3102.92s)]
*  racial resentment, anti-immigration, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3104.92s)]
*  like an instinct for that. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3106.92s)]
*  But I don't think he cares about [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3108.92s)]
*  this stuff as much as he does [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3109.92s)]
*  the tariffs. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3110.92s)]
*  He's been talking about tariffs for [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3111.92s)]
*  40 years, literally since the 80s. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3113.92s)]
*  Back then he was complaining about [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3115.92s)]
*  the Japanese allegedly ripping us [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3117.92s)]
*  off because Americans prefer Toyota [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3119.92s)]
*  and Honda to freaking, I don't [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3121.92s)]
*  know, Saturn or whatever, right? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3123.92s)]
*  And so I don't think anybody told [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3125.92s)]
*  him this. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3127.92s)]
*  And as far as Canadians and [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3128.92s)]
*  Mexicans, okay, first of all, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3130.92s)]
*  Canada, like our country, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3132.92s)]
*  is a very multicultural country. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3134.92s)]
*  If you find out that these idiots [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3136.92s)]
*  are just grabbing people off the [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3138.92s)]
*  street who might be Palestinians [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3140.92s)]
*  and they're just trying to get [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3142.92s)]
*  people to come and [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3144.92s)]
*  get off the street who might be [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3145.92s)]
*  Palestinian or who might vaguely be [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3147.92s)]
*  Middle Eastern and against or [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3150.92s)]
*  be accused of being anti the [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3152.92s)]
*  Israeli government's regime in [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3154.92s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3156.92s)]
*  And you can get snatched up, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3157.92s)]
*  put in some freaking hold and sell [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3159.92s)]
*  and be treated like some damn [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3161.92s)]
*  criminal. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3163.92s)]
*  Why the hell would you come to [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3164.92s)]
*  America? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3166.92s)]
*  Now, if you're white big bread, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3167.92s)]
*  you probably got nothing to worry [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3169.92s)]
*  about, but at the same time, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3171.92s)]
*  like again, Canada is a very [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3173.92s)]
*  multicultural and diverse country. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3175.92s)]
*  Same for Mexico. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3178.92s)]
*  These are brown people. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3180.92s)]
*  They're rounding up Venezuelans and [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3182.92s)]
*  El Salvadorians and Mexicans, okay? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3184.92s)]
*  They're rounding up people that [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3187.92s)]
*  they identify as vaguely Hispanic [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3189.92s)]
*  or Latin. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3191.92s)]
*  And what if you get mistaken for [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3192.92s)]
*  Salvadorian and you're Mexican? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3194.92s)]
*  And they send you to literally [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3196.92s)]
*  a gulag. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3198.92s)]
*  And they send you to a gulag. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3199.92s)]
*  They send you to literally a gulag. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3201.92s)]
*  We're dudes have beaten you up and [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3203.92s)]
*  starving you to death. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3205.92s)]
*  Why the hell would you voluntarily [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3207.92s)]
*  come up here to vacation at that? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3209.92s)]
*  To have fun. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3211.92s)]
*  Now, there are people that risk [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3212.92s)]
*  getting their lives, their safety [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3214.92s)]
*  to come up here, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3216.92s)]
*  make money for their family and [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3217.92s)]
*  stuff like that. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3219.92s)]
*  Then you understand why they're [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3220.92s)]
*  making a certain kind of sacrifice. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3222.92s)]
*  Did I freeze for you guys? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3224.92s)]
*  Yeah, you did. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3226.92s)]
*  All right, so we'll get back to [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3228.92s)]
*  Wasm in a little bit. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3230.92s)]
*  But yeah, to Wasm's point, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3231.92s)]
*  it is very dangerous to travel to [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3233.92s)]
*  this country now. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3235.92s)]
*  And there's been a lot of reports [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3236.92s)]
*  specifically for [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3238.92s)]
*  international travelers coming from [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3239.92s)]
*  Europe, from France and Germany, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3241.92s)]
*  who said that they've been harassed [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3243.92s)]
*  in American airports. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3245.92s)]
*  Who wants to deal with that? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3246.92s)]
*  Who doesn't have to deal with it? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3247.92s)]
*  And also, I would say that I don't [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3248.92s)]
*  think Trump really consider the [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3250.92s)]
*  loss of international tourist money [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3252.92s)]
*  as much as he probably should have. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3254.92s)]
*  Because I feel like he's so [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3256.92s)]
*  arrogant that he's like, well, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3258.92s)]
*  of course they'll come. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3259.92s)]
*  Of course they'll still want to [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3260.92s)]
*  come here. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3261.92s)]
*  This is the greatest country in [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3262.42s)]
*  the world. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3263.92s)]
*  So anyway, Was, are you back? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3264.42s)]
*  Yeah, I'm here. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3265.92s)]
*  Okay, do you want to finish [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3266.92s)]
*  your thought? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3267.92s)]
*  No. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3268.92s)]
*  I'm just saying, as a Haitian [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3269.92s)]
*  American, if they were rounding up [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3270.92s)]
*  a bunch of Jamaicans, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3272.92s)]
*  even if I'm not Jamaican, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3273.92s)]
*  I'd be like, damn, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3274.92s)]
*  I'm pretty adjacent to that. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3275.92s)]
*  I would not be coming to this [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3276.92s)]
*  country. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3278.92s)]

*  no due process, treating anybody [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3297.92s)]
*  as if they're hardened criminals. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3299.92s)]
*  Hell no, I'm staying my ass where [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3301.92s)]

*  My family's from Guyana in South [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3317.92s)]
*  America, so it's like I'm not [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3319.92s)]

*  that would turn up on a terrorist [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3323.92s)]
*  watch list, but I look like what I [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3325.92s)]
*  look like because I'm Indian. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3327.92s)]

*  they coming for your ass. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3332.92s)]
*  These racist people, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1IEekvc_E0&t=3333.92s)]
