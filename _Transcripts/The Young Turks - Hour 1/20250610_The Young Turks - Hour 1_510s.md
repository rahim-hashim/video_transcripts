"Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday removed every member of a scientific committee that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to use vaccines and pledged to replace them with his own picks.
Major physicians and public health groups criticized the move to oust all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices."*

# RFK Jr Shocks The Medical Community Once Again
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI)
*  Major changes are in store at the CDC. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=0.0s)]
*  Jr. is ousting all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=6.32s)]
*  One public health person I spoke with Dr. Michael Osterholm called the idea that RFK [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=13.64s)]
*  Jr., who has spread distrust in vaccines himself, is doing this in order to restore public trust. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=17.92s)]
*  He said that's like the arsonist complaining about fires in the neighborhood. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=23.68s)]
*  That's right, HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. has shocked the medical community once again, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=28.56s)]
*  this time by firing every single member of the CDC's Vaccine Advisory Board or committee, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=37.92s)]
*  I should say, amplifying fears that he is planning to basically usher in these non-experts [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=43.84s)]
*  and vaccine skeptics into these powerful roles. Now, the Advisory Committee on Immunization [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=50.16s)]
*  Practices, also known as ACIP, their job is to basically carefully review data on vaccines, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  debate the evidence, and also vote on who should get the shots and when. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=66.56s)]
*  So it has played a vital role in America's public health. For instance, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=72.88s)]
*  whether or not people get vaccinated is heavily influenced by what their doctors recommend. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=77.44s)]
*  For decades, doctors have been following the ACIP guidance. It's also been considered the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=83.11999999999999s)]
*  gold standard in determining vaccine schedules for children and adults. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  But we live in a society right now where there's already pretty deep distrust [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  toward our institutions, the CDC being one of them, especially following COVID and some [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=99.84s)]
*  of the decisions that were made there. So it's kind of the perfect environment for RFK Jr. to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=105.12s)]
*  try to do this, and that is worrying to a large extent. So in a Wall Street Journal op-ed announcing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=111.52s)]
*  his decision, Kennedy decried the crisis of public trust, and this is what he wrote, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  under my direction, HHS is putting the restoration of public trust above any pro or anti-vaccine [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=125.36s)]
*  agenda. Is it? It seems like this is the anti-vaccine agenda. Nonetheless, the public must know [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=133.28s)]
*  that unbiased science guides the recommendations from our health agencies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=140.72s)]
*  This will ensure the American people receive the safest vaccines possible. He also claimed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=147.04s)]
*  that the committee has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest, which is fascinating [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=152.32s)]
*  because it appears there's some pretty significant conflicts of interest within [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=159.44s)]
*  HHS under his leadership. But I'll get to that in just a moment. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=163.28s)]
*  Most of ACIP's members have received substantial funding from pharmaceutical companies, including [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=167.04s)]
*  those marketing vaccines. The problem isn't necessarily that ACIP members are corrupt, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=172.8s)]
*  most likely aim to serve the public interest as they understand it. The problem is their immersion [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=179.28s)]
*  in a system of industry aligned incentives and paradigms that enforce a narrow pro-industry [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  orthodoxy. The new members won't directly work for the vaccine industry. They will exercise [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=193.12s)]
*  independent judgment, refuse to serve as a rubber stamp, and foster a culture of critical inquiry, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=200.0s)]
*  unafraid to ask hard questions. Now look, that all sounds good. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=206.56s)]
*  And there absolutely are problems with this revolving door issue, right? Between the medical [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=210.72s)]
*  like the medical communities, the regulatory agencies, private industry, and the fact that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=218.48s)]
*  they have a profit motive. There is corruption in our system, including in government agencies like [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=225.44s)]
*  HHS and all of the different little smaller agencies or sub-agencies that fall under that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=231.92s)]
*  category. Those problems exist. I don't wanna minimize that. That's something that we've been [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=237.28s)]
*  drawing attention to on the show for years. But he didn't provide any evidence for his claim [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=241.12s)]
*  that quote, most of ACIP members have received substantial funding from pharmaceutical companies. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=248.4s)]
*  And that's likely because the claim is actually false. So committee members are required to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=255.44s)]
*  declare any potential conflicts and business interests that arise during their tenure. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=261.36s)]
*  They also have to disclose any possible conflicts at the start of each public meeting. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=267.76s)]
*  Each public meeting, they have to disclose those conflicts of interest and they must [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=273.36s)]
*  recuse themselves if these conflicts exist. And perhaps most importantly, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  they're barred from holding stocks or serving on advisory boards affiliated with vaccine [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=284.08s)]
*  manufacturers. That is the truth. Nonetheless, he fired all 17 members and has not said who [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=291.2s)]
*  he would appoint to this panel, which is supposed to convene in just two weeks in Atlanta. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=297.12s)]
*  Doctors, researchers and medical groups all over the country are condemning this decision, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=303.36s)]
*  calling it reckless and dangerous. Dr. Sean O'Leary, who's the chair of the Infectious [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=308.32s)]
*  Disease Committee for the American Academy of Pediatrics, says the move will exacerbate [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=312.8s)]
*  mistrust in vaccines. And I happen to agree with him on that. He says, I don't think there's any [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=317.6s)]
*  way to put this other than saying that this is an unmitigated public health disaster. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=322.4s)]
*  Both parents and pediatricians are really confused by the actions right now. And this is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=327.84s)]
*  only going to make things worse. What also makes things worse is there are some examples of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  corruption that RFK Jr. seems to be okay with, but that's a story for another time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm curious what you think, Was. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=347.12s)]
*  It's just sad that I gotta say in terms of the eroded trust with the CDC and Fauci and his [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=349.28s)]
*  involvement with a private company and the Wuhan leak and not just that, but then the repression [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=358.08s)]
*  of any freaking dissent on YouTube or on social where it felt like there was a concerted conspiracy [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=365.84s)]
*  to squash any questioning of what was going on. And then it's kind of revealed later, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=375.44s)]
*  like it turns out the Wuhan lab leak theory is the truth. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=382.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=387.68s)]
*  The right one. It sucks the way they handled all of that because again, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=388.32s)]
*  as you said, Anna, this gives this crank license to come in and be like, these people are [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=394.4s)]
*  untrustworthy. The way they handled the pandemic was horrible. And me and my crack pot snake oil [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=400.64s)]
*  stuff is gonna be the way forward. And that's the saddest part. And I think that's been the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=409.68s)]
*  sort of biggest revelation of the last 10, 15 years of liberalism just writ large, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  just this inability to ever reform itself and make itself better without nastiness like this [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=423.44s)]
*  happening. And so yeah, we're all gonna be on the receiving end of the consequences because of it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=430.48s)]
*  Yeah. And you make a really good point about the massive errors and the censorship that took place [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  during the coronavirus pandemic. That created the perfect opportunity for what we're seeing now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=443.6s)]
*  And I don't blame ordinary Americans for distrusting our institutions. Now Sean O'Leary [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=448.64000000000004s)]
*  said what he said about the impact on public health. But let's also talk about how [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=455.92s)]
*  ousting this entire panel could also have some major consequences when it comes to patients' [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=461.44s)]
*  ability to even pay for vaccines. So that's because the insurance companies and government [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=467.36s)]
*  programs like Medicaid are required to cover the vaccines that are recommended by the panel. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=474.56s)]
*  So if you have a panel full of people who are anti-vax, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=481.28s)]
*  and they're not recommending vaccines, but parents wanna get their kids vaccinated with said vaccines, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=484.96s)]
*  they're gonna have to pay for it out of pocket. The Medicaid system is not going to pay for it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=490.4s)]
*  So that's coming. And you should all be concerned about it as I am. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30V3sGhDmjI&t=497.59999999999997s)]
