"Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky said Thursday night that the United States should stop all military aid to Israel, citing mounting civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip.
Newsweek reached out to Massie's office via email Thursday for comment.
Why It Matters
Tensions in the Middle East remain high despite ongoing ceasefire negotiations between the Israeli government and Hamas, with the U.S. acting as a key interlocutor. Tens of thousands of people in Gaza have died as a result of Israel's war against Hamas, which was launched in response to Hamas' attack in Israel on October 7, 2023.
President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly suggested that the U.S. "take over the Gaza Strip," adding at a news briefing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and all of the other weapons on the site.""

# Republican INFURIATES His Own Party
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4)
*  Republican Representative Thomas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=0.0s)]
*  Massey has been one of the few [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=2.42s)]
*  lawmakers to openly criticize [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=4.58s)]
*  Israel's influence on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=6.7s)]
*  the American government. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=8.24s)]
*  And just last week he went further [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=10.34s)]
*  than honestly most Democrats are [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=12.16s)]
*  willing to go writing nothing can [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  justify the number of civilian [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  casualties, tens of thousands of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=17.38s)]
*  women and children inflicted by [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=19.26s)]
*  Israel in Gaza in the last two [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=21.0s)]
*  years, we should end all US military [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=22.5s)]
*  aid to Israel now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=24.46s)]
*  So I want to just- [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=26.28s)]
*  I just want to pause and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=26.9s)]
*  comment on the fact that for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=28.16s)]
*  the longest time Thomas Massey has [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  focused his disagreement with [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  supporting Israel's war by saying [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=34.0s)]
*  that we are using our finite [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=36.3s)]
*  resources and sending it to a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=38.12s)]
*  foreign country to carry out what [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=40.0s)]
*  they're carrying out in Gaza. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=42.2s)]
*  He was less willing to be as [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=44.16s)]
*  critical of how Israel is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=46.0s)]
*  prosecuting this war as he is right [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=47.7s)]
*  now, and I commend him for that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=49.96s)]
*  because it is true, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=51.8s)]
*  tens of thousands likely very [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=52.96s)]
*  willing to support Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=54.56s)]
*  And likely more civilians have been [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=56.14s)]
*  killed in Gaza and it is a moral [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=58.64s)]
*  issue that he's drawing attention [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=60.68s)]
*  to, but that did earn Massey a lot [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  of criticism and he didn't back [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=65.16s)]
*  down, so one person wrote in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  response, you just told us you're [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=69.47999999999999s)]
*  not a Christian without saying it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  So for this person who accuses him [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  of not being a Christian, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=76.72s)]
*  what does Christianity mean to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=78.36s)]
*  this person exactly? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=80.2s)]
*  Christianity requires you to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=81.44s)]
*  slaughter innocent civilians, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=83.24s)]
*  slaughter innocent civilians in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=85.12s)]
*  Gaza on behalf of a foreign [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=87.0s)]
*  country. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=88.48s)]
*  You're supposed to support that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=90.12s)]
*  with weapons, with American tax [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=91.86s)]
*  dollars, how does that make any [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=93.66s)]
*  sense? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=95.36s)]
*  I mean, I literally went to Sunday [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=95.86s)]
*  school every Sunday from, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=97.96s)]
*  I think age three to age 19. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=99.6s)]
*  I don't remember reading anything [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=101.6s)]
*  about that in the Bible. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=103.58s)]
*  What kind of Christianity is this? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=104.92s)]
*  What kind of disgusting distortion [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=106.64s)]
*  of Christianity is that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=108.44s)]
*  Massey responded by saying, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=110.06s)]
*  I disagree with your version of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=111.48s)]
*  Christianity if it requires [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=113.02s)]
*  the deaths of women and children [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=114.56s)]
*  on behalf of any country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=116.36s)]
*  Now another figure who spoke out [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=118.84s)]
*  against Israel's conduct in Gaza [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  was former State Department [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=121.76s)]
*  spokesperson, if you can believe [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=123.08s)]
*  it, Matt Miller. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=124.62s)]
*  Suddenly Matt Miller found [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=126.04s)]
*  his morality. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  Now he served under the Biden [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=128.96s)]
*  administration and there were no [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=130.32s)]
*  brakes on that car when it came to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=132.0s)]
*  Israel, okay? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=133.56s)]
*  Never any pressure to sign a cease [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=134.6s)]
*  deal, a ceasefire deal. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=137.28s)]
*  That was made abundantly clear by [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=139.52s)]
*  the Israeli ambassador to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=141.32s)]
*  the United States who said, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=142.68s)]
*  we never felt any pressure from [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=144.2s)]
*  Biden to engage in a ceasefire deal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Now with that in mind, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=148.22s)]
*  if you've been watching the show [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=149.48s)]
*  for a while, you probably remember [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=151.32s)]
*  that we've played many clips of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=153.32s)]
*  Miller essentially downplaying [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  Israel's war crimes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  And now he's changed his tune, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=158.48s)]
*  I wonder what happened. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  I think what is most certainly not [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  an open question is that there have [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=165.26s)]
*  been individual incidents that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=167.2s)]
*  have been war crimes where Israeli [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=169.0s)]
*  soldiers, members of the Israeli [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  military have committed war crimes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=172.84s)]
*  Even that statement, by the way, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=175.88s)]
*  is just minimizing the fact that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=178.48s)]
*  the Israeli government has been [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=180.74s)]
*  ordering all of these terrible [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=183.02s)]
*  atrocities that have been carried [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  out in Gaza, okay? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  Acting as if it's like, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=188.88s)]
*  there's just a few bad apples in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=190.58s)]
*  the IDF, please. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  We've all heard the statements from [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=193.76s)]
*  Smotrich, Ben Gavir, Netanyahu [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=196.12s)]
*  himself. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=198.5s)]
*  He continues, the thing that I look [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=200.12s)]
*  at is that is in that intervening [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=202.4s)]
*  period between the end of May and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  the middle of January 2025, when [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=206.64s)]
*  thousands of Palestinians, innocent [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=208.94s)]
*  civilians were killed, was there [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  more that we could have done to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=213.6s)]
*  pressure the Israeli government to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  agree to that ceasefire? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=217.44s)]
*  I think at times there probably was. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=218.88s)]
*  No, not probably, Matt, not [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=220.72s)]
*  probably, definitely, definitely. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=222.16s)]
*  And he has as much blood on his [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=224.44s)]
*  hands as other Biden administration [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=226.24s)]
*  officials who allowed this to keep [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=228.48s)]
*  going on into the Trump [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  administration, okay? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=232.27999999999997s)]
*  They're just as liable for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  the slaughters that have happened [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=235.88s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip as the current [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=238.0s)]

*  over your hands. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=346.03999999999996s)]

*  about it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=348.88s)]
*  Okay, so Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=349.52s)]
*  also came on this show and said we [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  should stop funding Israel. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=354.11999999999995s)]
*  Okay, so there's a MAGA rebellion. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=357.08s)]
*  Look, for the folks on the- [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=360.2s)]
*  There's a difference though, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=361.79999999999995s)]
*  Cenk, there is a difference. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=362.7s)]
*  So look, talk is cheap. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=363.96s)]
*  And so if Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=366.11999999999995s)]
*  is actually willing to put her [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=367.96s)]
*  words into action by voting against [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=369.64s)]
*  a budget or against additional [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=371.71999999999997s)]

*  I haven't seen it yet. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=376.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's different when it comes [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  to Thomas Massie. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=380.04s)]
*  Thomas Massie has actually put [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  action into his words. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=383.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm going to tell you [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=384.56s)]
*  because you could watch it yourself [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=385.68s)]
*  and you should watch it on our [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=387.0s)]
*  YouTube channel, okay? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=388.32s)]
*  So Marjorie Taylor Greene at least [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=389.88s)]
*  did this. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=391.56s)]
*  So they proposed a bill that if you [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=392.48s)]
*  advocate for the boycott of Israel, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=394.6s)]
*  that the American government would [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=396.88s)]
*  punish you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  Because how dare you defy a foreign [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=400.04s)]
*  government? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=402.0s)]
*  And it was MAGA that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=403.12s)]
*  led a revolt against that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=404.0s)]
*  And yes, it was Marjorie Taylor [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=405.92s)]
*  Greene who did it, okay? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=407.68s)]
*  So I disagree with her on over 90% [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=409.24s)]
*  of policies. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=412.44s)]
*  But if you can't see that that's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  a win, what, so [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  did we want that bill? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=417.44s)]
*  Where if you called for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  a boycott of Israel, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=420.44s)]
*  the American government would [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  crack down on you? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=423.68s)]
*  No, we didn't want that bill. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=425.12s)]
*  So guys, there is an actual [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=426.56s)]
*  rebellion. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=427.92s)]
*  Now the only question is, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=428.92s)]
*  how far is it going to go? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=430.6s)]
*  And if they lose Trump, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=432.64s)]
*  are they actually going to actively [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=434.12s)]
*  say, no, Trump is wrong? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=436.64s)]
*  And we should not go to war with [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  Iran, and we should not do what [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=440.68s)]
*  Israel wants. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=442.88s)]
*  And Ana, you're right, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=444.56s)]
*  there's a second distinction [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=445.52s)]
*  between Massey and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=446.56s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=447.12s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene basically [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=448.28s)]
*  says, and again, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=449.8s)]
*  you could watch the interview, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=450.52s)]
*  but overall, she doesn't put a lot [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=451.88s)]
*  of thought or concern about [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  the Palestinian people, okay? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=455.12s)]
*  She just says, I don't want to send [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=456.79999999999995s)]
*  any more money, I'm sick of it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=458.84s)]
*  And so I'm done with it, right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=461.0s)]
*  Which I'll take. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  But Massey went further and said, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=464.84000000000003s)]
*  how many tens of thousands of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=466.68s)]

*  need to kill? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  No, I'm against the killing, and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQHlTsJz1U4&t=470.8s)]
