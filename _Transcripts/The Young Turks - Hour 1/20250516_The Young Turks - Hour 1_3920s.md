# Comey Accused Of Putting ‚ÄúHIT OUT‚Äù On Trump. Hardliner Repubs BLOCK Bill. - May 16, 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA)
*  Drop it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, Power Panel, Cenk Uygur, John Irola, Maz Gibran with you guys right here on The [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=10.0s)]
*  Young Turks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=24.68s)]
*  So we're gonna have an interesting show today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=26.68s)]
*  We've got Republican histrionics. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=29.52s)]
*  We've got people getting canceled for criticizing Israel, of course. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=34.32s)]
*  Any day of the week that's going to happen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=39.24s)]
*  We've got Democratic Congress people enthusiastically threatening their careers for criticizing Israel, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=41.28s)]
*  which is of course another Tuesday moment. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=46.96s)]
*  We've got Republicans potentially, well, not potentially, definitely messing with families [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=49.6s)]
*  decision making at a sick macabre level. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=54.28s)]
*  So lots to look forward to, plus I'm in a bit of an angry mood. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=58.28s)]
*  So you never know what happens. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=64.48s)]
*  All right, so John, if you will take it away and let's see what happens. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=65.48s)]
*  Don't say anything you might regret. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=69.48s)]
*  Don't put shells in a shape that you might regret. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=71.12s)]
*  Yeah, don't say, don't mention anything in a graduation speech against Israel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=73.8s)]
*  Otherwise, US Congressmen will try to ruin your life because they'd like to play out [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=78.88s)]
*  anti-Semitic tropes in front of the whole nation. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=84.0s)]
*  Anyways, we'll get to that story in a second. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=86.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=88.56s)]
*  Let's start with this though. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=89.56s)]
*  James Comey, our former FBI director, posted on Instagram something that many are interpreting [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=92.0s)]
*  as a call for violence on the president. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=98.6s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=100.64s)]
*  It says 8647. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=101.64s)]
*  He knew exactly what that meant. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=102.64s)]
*  A child knows what that meant. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=105.76s)]
*  If you're the FBI director and you don't know what that meant, that meant assassination. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=107.6s)]
*  It says it loud and clear. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=115.84s)]
*  I love the confident casual assertion that a child knows what 8647 means from a guy who [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=118.64s)]
*  just two weeks ago didn't know how Photoshop worked. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  Thought that labels on a picture was literal tattoos. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=127.92s)]
*  Tell me more, genius. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=130.8s)]
*  But anyway, what he's referring to there, James Comey supposedly calling for his unaliving [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=132.78s)]
*  is the photo that they showed it there in Fox and Friends. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=138.52s)]
*  This shells in the shape of 8647 with the caption cool shell formation on my beach walk. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=142.24s)]
*  Now there is a backlash. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  The right have all decided that this can only possibly mean a call for violence, which they [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=152.0s)]
*  would never tolerate. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=158.22s)]
*  They'd never do it themselves, obviously. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=159.22s)]
*  So he should probably have already been taken out by law enforcement. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=161.78s)]
*  We're waiting on that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  But in advance of him being arrested, he posted this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=167.9s)]
*  I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  were a political message. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=176.48s)]
*  I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers of violence. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=178.12s)]
*  It never occurred to me, but I oppose violence of any kind, so I took the post down. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=181.24s)]
*  So look, there's a lot that we have to jump into, but just really fast. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=185.44s)]
*  He seems to be implying that he came across the shells. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=189.28s)]
*  Now I don't think doing the shells yourself and taking the photo is unacceptable. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=193.68s)]
*  But I also think that that's what he did. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=198.84s)]
*  And he's implying that he was just walking along the beach and he came across it, which [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=200.6s)]
*  I don't necessarily buy that, but what do you think? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=204.28s)]
*  That part is irrelevant. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=206.88s)]
*  I might believe him, but I don't care. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=207.88s)]
*  Yeah, if he did it as well, it's totally fine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=209.76s)]
*  All right, so if you're a right winger, you're not gonna wanna watch this video. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=212.2s)]
*  That's not a thing you hear often. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=215.36s)]
*  But we're gonna show how massively hypocritical the right wing is on this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  And so, and if you try to pretend that the right wing is not hypocritical on this, it's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=221.6s)]
*  if you don't know yet, no problem, we're gonna show you the evidence. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  Okay, if after the evidence you still say, no, I don't see any hypocrisy here, you're [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=232.28s)]
*  a bit of a loon. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=236.36s)]
*  You're disqualifying yourself from intelligent conversation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=238.56s)]
*  But hold on, let's see the receipts first. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=242.4s)]
*  Maybe we're full of crap. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=244.8s)]
*  Or if you want, just turn it off now, because we're gonna prove that Trump is 100% full [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  of crap here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=250.16s)]
*  So if that's gonna hurt your feelings, go away now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=251.28s)]
*  You don't wanna see evidence, I know. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, and to be clear, there's gonna be two flavors of being full of crap here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  So the first flavor is implying that he could only mean violence, which is just, that's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  just not true, I'm sorry. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=265.48s)]
*  86 is slang meaning to throw out, to get rid of, or to refuse service to. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=267.6s)]
*  Or like I said on TDR this morning, I was a bartender and I was a waiter and I've been [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  a busboy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=277.68s)]
*  86 means something's off the menu, that's literally all it means. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=278.68s)]
*  It's slang. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=280.72s)]
*  It's slang, and in particular, recently, for political purposes, there are some Democrats [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  that use it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  It just means you're opposed to Trump. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=288.88000000000005s)]
*  People put it on signs. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=290.68s)]
*  It doesn't mean that they're calling for him to be unalived or whatever. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=291.68s)]
*  And you can say, sure, but someone might interpret it that way. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=295.0s)]
*  Or maybe the craziest person in a rally thinks that, that's fine. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=299.48s)]
*  What you can't say is that that's what it means, and that that's what he was intending. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  Because that's simply not how numbers work, 86 in this particular case. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  Sean, I'm gonna interrupt for a real quick question. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  So when you talked about 86ing when you were a waiter, how many people did you wind up [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=312.68s)]
*  murdering? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, on a given night, one to two or whatever, you do more than that in the manager complaints. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, because for all you waiters and waitresses out there, we all know you're serial killers. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=321.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  Because we're gonna entertain this absurd, ridiculous, insane conversation. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay, let's- [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and the reason that I bring up the restaurant thing is, look, we're gonna be snarky and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=332.20000000000005s)]
*  sarcastic in the rest of this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=335.44s)]
*  But for that portion, I'm just trying to educate you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=336.76s)]
*  Because I know that you guys routinely are so disconnected from real life and real jobs, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=339.12s)]
*  you mock people in the service industry. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=344.62s)]
*  The idea that AOC was once a bartender is a joke to you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=346.52s)]
*  You're such men of the people, such populists. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=350.08s)]
*  But anyway, so he's being investigated now by the DOJ. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=352.82s)]
*  Pam Bondi is on this thing, and there is a real chance that they try to do something. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=357.24s)]
*  They have no case, but whatever. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=363.3s)]
*  They've disregarded the law, they've disregarded the Constitution. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=365.44s)]
*  habeas corpus is a thing of the past. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=368.04s)]
*  So sure, lock up a former guy from the FBI. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=369.68s)]
*  In any event, here's what Don Jr. said about this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=372.96s)]
*  Just James Comey casually calling for my dad to be murdered. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=376.44s)]
*  This is who the damn media worships, demented. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=380.66s)]
*  Okay, okay, just wanna remind everyone, he's the guy that posted funny little jokes on [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=383.24s)]
*  Instagram about Paul Pelosi's skull being smashed open with a hammer. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=389.2s)]
*  Very funny, yeah. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  Casually. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  Remember when our fan was trying to murder you with a hammer? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  But he actually meant it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=400.72s)]
*  He thought that was funny. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=401.72s)]
*  The attempted murder of Nancy Pelosi's husband was apparently hilarious to him. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=403.32000000000005s)]
*  But a totally meaningless number that at a worst case scenario could be misinterpreted. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=407.5s)]
*  But he's trying to murder him. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=414.56s)]
*  You histrionic little bitch, okay? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=418.44000000000005s)]
*  So I got a lot more where that came from. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=421.5s)]

*  rule of law. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=520.76s)]

*  I do. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=535.12s)]
*  I did not think that I could be surprised by Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=537.32s)]
*  I mean, she's a clown, she's been a joke for many years, but that's beyond I think anything. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=542.24s)]
*  It's a call for assassins. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  It's not a crass comment, it couldn't maybe be misinterpreted. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  It couldn't have multiple meanings. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=554.84s)]
*  It is a direct call for assassination and he should be behind bars because of the JPEG [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=556.0s)]
*  he put on Instagram. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=562.44s)]
*  And she is dead serious. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=564.2800000000001s)]
*  That is how far into this fascistic regime she is. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=566.12s)]
*  That said, I know that you're really interested in the hypocrisy of it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=570.12s)]
*  If you want, you can walk us through Jack Pasabeik or however it's pronounced, I can't [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=574.16s)]
*  if you prefer, but I know that's your favorite part of this. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=578.38s)]
*  Yeah, so I can't wait to get to Mos to, so let me just before we get to the hypocrisy, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=580.8s)]
*  couple of things here. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  The problem with the Bondi and Noam and Tulsi is that they're, I mean, they signed up for [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=587.16s)]
*  it, don't misinterpret it what I'm saying. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=593.2s)]
*  They're forced to kiss Trump's ass, that's what the job description is now. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=594.92s)]
*  So Trump thinks it's an assassination attempt. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  They all have to go through and lie and go on TV and say it's an assassination attempt [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=601.4799999999999s)]
*  and the president almost died twice and so Comey almost nearly killed him a third time. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=605.9599999999999s)]
*  They have to say these outlandish, moronic, pathetic things, right? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=611.28s)]
*  Because that's what they sign up for. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=616.62s)]
*  Quick side note, I know we're often ahead of folks. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=618.16s)]
*  When we call that Tulsi Gabbard years and years and years ago, and a lot of progressive [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=624.04s)]
*  said no, no, no, Tulsi's right, Tulsi's true left, you guys are right wingers. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=629.6s)]
*  And then it turned out we were right, Tulsi's a giant, giant fraud who kisses anybody's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=634.76s)]
*  ass to get into power, okay? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=639.96s)]
*  So you're welcome for exposing her years before anyone else did, okay? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=642.52s)]
*  So here she is. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=646.98s)]
*  And now, not only is she being absolutely ridiculous, but she's acting, all these people, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=649.0s)]
*  it's super ironic, because they're putting Comey's life in danger. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=655.44s)]
*  They're telling every unhinged MAGA guy out there, and you guys, if you've been paying [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=659.12s)]
*  attention to us, you know, we don't think all Trump voters are unhinged. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=664.22s)]
*  We don't even think all Trump voters are MAGA. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=668.36s)]
*  We have a sophisticated nuance, look at Trump voters. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=670.96s)]
*  But at the outer edge of MAGA is a bunch of loons, okay? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=673.64s)]
*  And so when they hear, my God, Comey's trying to kill Trump. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=678.36s)]
*  What do you think they're gonna do? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=682.16s)]
*  The guys who smashed Pelosi's head in, Paul Pelosi's head in, you're putting Comey's life [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=683.3000000000001s)]
*  in a thousand times more danger than Comey with his freaking shells put Trump's life. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=688.76s)]
*  And are we consistent on this? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=694.84s)]
*  Remember, Comey is the one that Democrats hate at the most because he reopened the Hillary [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=696.36s)]
*  investigation right before the 2016 election. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=701.12s)]
*  And that very likely did cost her the election, and Democrats loathed him for it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=706.24s)]
*  And what did we say here on The Young Turks? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=710.0s)]
*  Were we biased and said, arrest them, lock them up, he's a traitor, it's treason. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=712.16s)]
*  No, we said, hey, that's life in the big city. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=716.6s)]
*  So he released it right before the election? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=719.8s)]
*  Well do better, win more votes, right? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=723.12s)]
*  Just because you don't agree with someone politically doesn't mean you go to arrest them. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=727.12s)]
*  That's what authoritarian people do, I know, I know. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=731.96s)]
*  But you guys arrested Trump just because he had massive financial frauds and [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=734.68s)]
*  he took top secret documents home to his freaking bathroom and left them there, etc. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=738.48s)]
*  And so I know. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=743.04s)]
*  There's a coup too. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=744.04s)]
*  And I'm so frustrated that people are so biased, they're blinded, blinded by their bias. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=745.04s)]
*  Yes, on both sides, but come on, right wing, they do this a thousand times more. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=754.84s)]
*  Okay, now, let me, okay, before I get to the hypocrisy, let me get, but [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=760.32s)]
*  I swear the hypocrisy is beautiful. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=765.72s)]
*  Mas, first you. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=768.2s)]
*  Wow, first of all, the authoritarianism is looking for [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=770.84s)]
*  excuses to arrest people, and so here we are. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=776.1600000000001s)]
*  They're going after James Comey, and who knows who else is going to offend them or [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=778.48s)]
*  they're going to claim is a threat. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=784.24s)]
*  And to your guys' point, I'm a comedian. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=786.4000000000001s)]
*  When I hear somebody got 86, that means they got kicked out of the club, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=789.5999999999999s)]
*  they got kicked out of the bar. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=792.52s)]
*  And this actually is telling, if anybody is actually interpreting that as a call [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=794.1199999999999s)]
*  to assassination, it's more telling about the person who's interpreting that [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  than it is from the person that it came from. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=803.68s)]
*  Because most people that I know know 86 is getting kicked out of somewhere. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=806.64s)]
*  If you interpret 86 as getting killed or getting assassinated, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=811.0799999999999s)]
*  you probably are someone who is in that military mind frame and is aggro and [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=815.36s)]
*  ready to go, and so you guys are absolutely right. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=820.6400000000001s)]
*  First of all, John, early on when you were talking about did Comey's claiming he [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  came upon these shells, I can imagine Comey just literally walking on the beach [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=829.08s)]
*  on a morning and being like, you know what would be kind of cool is if I did this [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=834.44s)]
*  at 86, 47 shells, and it's going to be great. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=837.84s)]
*  People are going to love it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=841.0s)]
*  And then he's created this crazy, crazy thing where people are saying, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=842.36s)]
*  you want to kill the president? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=846.12s)]
*  And I know that, Cenk, you're going to be talking about the hypocrisy. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=848.0400000000001s)]
*  Some of the stuff that you're going to be showing are some tweets I know, but [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  more importantly, let's not forget. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=855.5200000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk, when there was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=857.6800000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk went on Twitter and said, why hasn't anyone tried to assassinate Biden [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=860.6400000000001s)]
*  or Kamala? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=865.12s)]
*  He basically was implying somebody should try it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=866.0400000000001s)]
*  Let's not forget that when the Central Park suspects were arrested, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=869.28s)]
*  Donald Trump took a full page ad out to get them executed and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=874.12s)]
*  has never apologized for it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=878.6s)]
*  So let's not forget that these people play the same game. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=881.04s)]
*  Let's not forget about January 6 and what they were willing to do. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=886.12s)]
*  And for them to take this thing and turn it around, this is clear as day, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=889.12s)]
*  authoritarians looking for excuses to start moving the goalposts so [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=893.6s)]
*  they can start arresting people that they don't like. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=898.16s)]
*  Yeah, so on the Elon Musk tweet, by the way, we covered that. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=901.56s)]
*  And outrageous saying why hasn't anyone tried to kill Biden or Kamala? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=905.04s)]
*  But then did we say Elon Musk must be arrested? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=911.04s)]
*  It was clearly an assassination attempt and he should be locked up forever. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=914.0s)]
*  No, we didn't say that because we're not snowflake right wingers. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=918.04s)]
*  My God, it's a number. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=922.56s)]
*  Okay, at a bare minimum. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=925.56s)]
*  All right, is anyone in the right wing going to be honest enough to admit that [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=927.16s)]
*  it could be interpreted in either direction at a bare minimum? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=930.8399999999999s)]
*  Way more used, not in the killing sense, but in the canceling sense. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=934.28s)]
*  But if you say no, it's only used in the killing sense, well, you're lying, so [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=939.48s)]
*  it's okay, or you're massively ignorant. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=943.24s)]
*  You're just new to this country, maybe you're an immigrant, I don't know, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=945.6s)]
*  maybe undocumented, I don't know. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=947.64s)]
*  I'm saying right wingers, okay? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=949.04s)]
*  So maybe you're in a gang, I don't know, you don't understand numbers, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=950.76s)]
*  you don't understand words. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=954.9599999999999s)]
*  All right, so let's now get to the hypocrisy. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=956.12s)]
*  First of all, Trump reposted an image of Joe Biden tied up in someone's trunk. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=972.44s)]
*  And thought it was funny, wouldn't it be great if someone kidnapped the president, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=981.96s)]
*  tied and gagged him on the way to murdering him? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=985.8399999999999s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=988.68s)]
*  But if you did that with Trump, right now, if James Comey, forget seashells, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=991.3599999999999s)]
*  had Trump gagged and bound in the back of a truck, what do you think they would do? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=996.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean, they might convict him within 24 hours, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1000.4799999999999s)]
*  like in some sort of kangaroo court and go, treason, right? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1004.24s)]
*  Okay, so what happened, right wingers? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1007.7199999999999s)]
*  What happened to that Trump retweeting that? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1009.24s)]
*  No, no, different rules, different rules. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1012.0s)]
*  That was direct call for violence, but it's okay, it's different rules. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1014.16s)]
*  All right, let's go to Psobiak. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1016.84s)]
*  So I want to actually go to graphic eight first, and [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1018.44s)]
*  then I'll go back to graphic seven. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  So he's super shocked by what's happened. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1021.72s)]
*  He's outraged. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1024.36s)]
*  So he says, the former director of the FBI is calling for [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1025.56s)]
*  the left wing assassins to target our president and kill him. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1028.88s)]
*  Have no idea why he hasn't been arrested yet. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1033.84s)]
*  That's a good question, because it seems like maybe the authorities are three years [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1036.28s)]
*  late in arresting Psobiak, because back in 2022, he posted this about Biden, 8646. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1041.32s)]
*  It's not even shells, it's more direct. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1049.76s)]
*  He literally wrote it out himself, posted it. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1052.3999999999999s)]
*  So now I tell you that for two reasons. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1057.0s)]
*  Number one, on people like Psobiak, he knows he wrote 8646. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1058.56s)]
*  He knows he's lying and doing histrionics. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1064.24s)]
*  And he knows that it's totally benign because he did it, right? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  Or maybe when he did it, he meant assassinate Biden. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1071.96s)]
*  We don't know that Comey meant that, but [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1076.48s)]
*  we just found out that Psobiak thinks every time you say 86, it means murder that guy. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1078.2s)]
*  So I think the FBI, by the Secret Service, which is still protecting Joe Biden, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1083.3999999999999s)]
*  former president, should go and talk to Psobiak. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1087.8s)]
*  Because I don't think 86 means assassinate someone, but [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1090.76s)]
*  Psobiak just told us he thinks definitively it means murder someone. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1094.08s)]
*  And he put that out about the former president. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1099.32s)]
*  So under his, not my logic, under his logic, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1101.36s)]
*  he should definitely be arrested right now, okay? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  Just to be safe. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1107.6399999999999s)]
*  Now is that going to happen? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1108.28s)]
*  Are right wingers going to call for [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1109.24s)]
*  Psobiak to get arrested because they really believe the number 86 means murder every time? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1110.56s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1116.12s)]
*  They're going to say, he was just trolling, he was just trolling, man, no big deal. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1116.92s)]
*  But sea shells, sea shells, my god, there's sea shells, I'm crying, I'm crying. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1119.8s)]
*  Sea shells, come on, get the hell out of here. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1123.96s)]
*  All right, it's not just Psobiak, Matt Gaetz. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1126.44s)]
*  We've now 86, McCarthy, McDaniel, McConnell, better days are ahead for [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1129.1200000000001s)]
*  the Republican Party, of course they are, because Matt Gaetz murdered all of those people. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1133.5600000000002s)]
*  Okay, arrest Matt Gaetz, come on, guys, who are you kidding? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1136.8000000000002s)]
*  By the way, people have been saying 86 in politics for a long time, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1141.8000000000002s)]
*  including Democrats. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1144.1200000000001s)]
*  Gretchen Whitmer said it about Trump in the first time. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1145.0s)]
*  She had like 86, 45. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1147.6000000000001s)]
*  But back then, people weren't pretending that that meant murder. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1149.8799999999999s)]
*  They're now, the new thing is not the number, the new thing is all the Republicans at once [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1154.1999999999998s)]
*  pretending it means murder. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1159.32s)]
*  So now we have to treat it like, it's a real debate. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1161.56s)]
*  And idiots on CNN are going around going, well, it could be, or maybe it should be, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1164.1999999999998s)]
*  let's get everything is 50-50. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1168.84s)]
*  No, guys, I'm the one who tells you, hey, listen, don't blame all Trump voters. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1171.1999999999998s)]
*  Hey, let's be nuanced here. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1175.1999999999998s)]
*  They're not all the same people, etc. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1177.36s)]
*  But that doesn't mean when someone is 100% wrong, that you call it 50-50. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1179.6s)]
*  Okay, wait, I'm not anywhere near done. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1185.28s)]
*  So now I know that Trump himself, because he's pure as the driven snow, and [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1187.32s)]
*  he's outraged by this number, would never call for violence himself. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1193.84s)]
*  There's no way, John, I bet you can't find it on tape once. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1199.24s)]
*  Beloved Donald Trump calling for violence when he's just the most peaceful guy on [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1202.6s)]
*  earth. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1206.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, let's see if it's ever happened. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1206.7199999999998s)]
*  Let's roll the tape. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1208.28s)]
*  President Trump escalating his war on the media. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1208.92s)]
*  Tweeting a mock video showing him outside a wrestling ring, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1215.96s)]
*  tackling and punching a man with the CNN logo covering his face. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1219.36s)]
*  You see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1223.28s)]
*  knock the crap out of him, would you? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1225.96s)]
*  We're not allowed to punch back anymore. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1228.08s)]
*  Like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1230.44s)]
*  Man that was, I don't know, you say roughed up. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1232.72s)]
*  He was so obnoxious and so loud. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1235.6s)]
*  He was screaming and they did, I don't know, rough up. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1237.6s)]
*  He should have been, maybe he should have been roughed up. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1240.36s)]
*  We will root out the communist, Marxist, fascist and [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1242.6799999999998s)]
*  the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1247.4399999999998s)]
*  Now if you had one really violent day, one rough hour, and I mean real rough, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1253.12s)]
*  the word will get out and it will end immediately. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  If you do something bad to us, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1263.96s)]
*  we are going to do things to you that have never been done before. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1266.12s)]
*  Okay, so none of that was violent. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1272.72s)]
*  Now if you say, hey guys, the CNN thing is just trolling, right? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1275.04s)]
*  He doesn't actually mean go attack a CNN reporter. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1278.28s)]
*  Hey, you got good company, that was me. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1281.36s)]
*  I was like, look, I get it, it's bad, he shouldn't do it, but [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1283.04s)]
*  he is trolling, right? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1285.48s)]
*  So now are you going to be fair back if you're in the right wing and [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1287.1999999999998s)]
*  you're going to say, yeah, yeah, I get it. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1292.52s)]
*  You see if that was Trump instead of the CNN logo and [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1294.28s)]
*  there was James Comey taking him down and punching Trump's face and stuff. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1297.24s)]
*  I think it was just trolling and it's no big deal. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1302.0s)]
*  And seashells that say 86, I think it's no big deal, it's just at worst trolling, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1304.28s)]
*  right? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1309.0s)]
*  And are the right wing going to do that? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1309.76s)]
*  No, no, they're going to see every one of those and go, I mean, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1311.24s)]
*  he's just saying punch them in the face and hurt them really badly and [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1314.08s)]
*  then all these things. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1317.56s)]
*  But it's all trolling, trolling, trolling, trolling. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1318.28s)]
*  Nothing counts, nothing counts, it was Trump, it's nothing counts. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1320.12s)]
*  Okay, how about when Liz Cheney, when he said about Liz Cheney, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1322.12s)]
*  they should train a gun on her face, okay? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1325.8s)]
*  Now, what did I say then? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1328.1999999999998s)]
*  I said, no, no, no, he didn't mean it like that. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1330.04s)]
*  I said, and then we got into a little bit of a debate here from what I recollect, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1332.08s)]
*  okay? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1336.36s)]
*  And but it was a tiny debate and I said, look guys, he means if she's such a hawk, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1337.08s)]
*  why doesn't she go into war? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1344.0s)]
*  And we've said that in the past about chicken hawks like Dick Cheney, etc. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1346.28s)]
*  And we had that debate and we were fair. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1350.08s)]
*  But a lot of some folks on the left say to us, don't be fair, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1352.04s)]
*  the right wing doesn't deserve fairness. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1356.1599999999999s)]
*  On a story like this, it does make you think. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1358.6799999999998s)]
*  So are we just both going to be blind? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1361.32s)]
*  We're just going to be both be biased? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1363.12s)]
*  And we're just going to tell you every time that Trump says something, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1365.08s)]
*  he meant to murder everyone and he meant to murder Liz Cheney. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1367.76s)]
*  And then you guys are going to say that you criticize Trump or Israel, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1371.0s)]
*  that made you murder and you're anti-Semite and etc. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1373.96s)]
*  And we're going to just inflate everything into some sort of ridiculous drama. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1377.2s)]
*  Okay, and that's what people want, yeah. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1383.3600000000001s)]
*  Really fast and this is going too far. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1385.56s)]
*  Remember when Trump supporters tried to run the campaign bus off the road? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1388.0s)]
*  And Trump reposted the image of it because he thought it was awesome that they tried [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1393.52s)]
*  to run the bus off the road, maybe everyone would die. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1396.8400000000001s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1399.1200000000001s)]
*  On that, see the Liz Cheney thing is he was saying if she wants war, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1400.32s)]
*  she should go to war and then guns would be trained on her face. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1405.24s)]
*  That doesn't mean train a gun on her face. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1407.8s)]
*  In the case of the bus, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1409.8400000000001s)]
*  they were literally trying to run the bus off the road. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1410.92s)]
*  That was super dangerous. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1413.56s)]
*  That was not seashells. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1415.56s)]
*  That was not symbolism or a metaphor. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1416.88s)]
*  If they actually ran the bus off the road, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1419.76s)]
*  a lot of people would have gotten really hurt and maybe died. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1421.44s)]
*  And Trump's like, that's awesome. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1424.32s)]
*  I like that you did. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1426.04s)]
*  We're doing actual violence. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1427.04s)]
*  That would be great if you did violence against the left. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1428.72s)]
*  So spare me. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1431.16s)]
*  And Trump like laughing at Paul Pelosi too. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1432.32s)]
*  You mentioned that earlier. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1434.64s)]
*  We smashed his head in with a fan of mine did it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1435.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's so funny. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1439.5600000000002s)]
*  Get any now you're concerned about violence. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1441.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know zero credibility, zero credibility. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1444.3200000000002s)]
*  One more. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1447.48s)]
*  One more because it's about calling for violence specifically for [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1448.0s)]
*  a candidate. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1450.0800000000002s)]
*  He was running against Hillary Clinton. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1450.8400000000001s)]
*  And he said if she gets in, there's nothing you can do. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1452.44s)]
*  Well, maybe the Second Amendment people, maybe they could do something. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1455.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1458.24s)]
*  What is that? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1458.76s)]
*  What is that supposed to mean? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1459.48s)]
*  There's no restaurant context. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1460.16s)]
*  I was in a lot of different restaurants. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1461.3600000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean anything. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1463.48s)]
*  That doesn't mean you're off the menu. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1464.32s)]
*  That means people who love guns could take her out. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1465.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that was actually one of the worst things he ever said. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1468.36s)]
*  because there is no other explanation for it. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1471.56s)]
*  But every time you told the right one, he said, so what? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1474.28s)]
*  So what? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1476.56s)]
*  So what? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1477.3999999999999s)]
*  Seashells. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1477.9199999999998s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1479.84s)]
*  You look like bitches. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1480.6399999999999s)]
*  If you're in the right way, you look freaking pathetic. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1482.08s)]
*  Seashells. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1485.28s)]
*  Seashells. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1486.12s)]
*  Of course, the Second Amendment would take out Hillary Clinton. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1487.36s)]
*  We murder her. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1489.6399999999999s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1490.52s)]
*  We lock her up. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1491.1599999999999s)]
*  You're going to charge Trump? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, seashells. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1494.8799999999999s)]
*  Come on, bitches. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1497.36s)]
*  Come on. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1498.7199999999998s)]
*  All right, Mas. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1499.8799999999999s)]
*  By the way, first of all, they talk about cancer culture. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1501.1599999999999s)]
*  They go, oh, you guys, you can't say anything. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1508.0s)]
*  You can't say anything. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1511.36s)]
*  And then to your point, this guy puts up these seashells, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1512.04s)]
*  and they're freaking out by it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1515.1999999999998s)]
*  And if I were his publicist, I'd be like, just go out and say [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1516.56s)]
*  86, 47 references when the Mets won in 86 and the Yankees [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1519.64s)]
*  in 47. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1526.6000000000001s)]
*  That's what I was talking about. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1527.64s)]
*  And of course, they say, no, you're trying to kill our guy. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1529.0400000000002s)]
*  It's such a ridiculous thing that these guys are doing, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1531.48s)]
*  and it is so hypocritical. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1535.24s)]
*  And we saw, also, by the way, whenever [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1537.4s)]
*  there's a mass shooter or even the guy who tried to shoot him, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1541.68s)]
*  they tend to have allegiances to the right wing. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1545.64s)]
*  I'm not saying there's not crazy people on the left wing, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1552.0s)]
*  but I am saying that up until now, anyone who's [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1554.2800000000002s)]
*  been doing anything less violent tends [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1556.68s)]
*  to be going off of Trump's playbook, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1559.4s)]
*  off of the far-right's playbook. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1562.6000000000001s)]
*  And so for these guys, again, to pretend like this is a thing [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1565.1200000000001s)]
*  is crazy, but more importantly, let's keep an eye on what they [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1569.44s)]
*  do, because if Comey does have to deal with some sort [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1573.08s)]
*  of legal repercussions, this is not a good thing for any of us, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1577.8799999999999s)]
*  because they're going to find ways to come after you. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1582.44s)]
*  Yeah, last point is from one of our members. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1586.8s)]
*  You're right, he reminded me of this. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1589.44s)]
*  I had forgotten. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1591.0s)]
*  You're awesome for reminding me. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1591.6399999999999s)]
*  She's on TYT.com. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1593.0s)]
*  I want to give right wingers a history lesson, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1594.6s)]
*  and she included a picture of the IDF bomb with my name on it. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1596.56s)]
*  I think that's a little bit more of a threat than seashells [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1601.6399999999999s)]
*  with the numbers 86 on it. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1605.6799999999998s)]
*  When they put your name on a bomb, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1609.24s)]
*  that's a pretty significant threat. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1611.48s)]
*  And that's why I had all of the IDF arrested. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1614.08s)]
*  Okay, but go ahead, still pretend that this is a big deal, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1617.76s)]
*  cry and cry and cry, and then try to arrest them, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1621.36s)]
*  and the people talking about treason, and so okay, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1624.3999999999999s)]
*  now we're getting into real violence, etc. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1627.4399999999998s)]
*  And then say, I don't know why people think we're authoritarian. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1630.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know why that occurred to anyone. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1633.36s)]
*  Golly gee, we're pure. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1635.8s)]
*  And all of a sudden somebody came along and said, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1637.4399999999998s)]
*  just because we want to arrest the guy that Donald Trump doesn't like for [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1640.08s)]
*  seashells, all of a sudden we're authoritarian. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1643.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's how it works. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1645.76s)]
*  Okay, we got to take a break. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1647.8799999999999s)]
*  When we come back, as you can tell, I'm in a mood, so buckle up. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1649.52s)]
*  All right, back on TYT, Cenk, John, and Maz with you guys. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1654.28s)]
*  One super chat here, Neil Whittington wrote in, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1672.72s)]
*  dump Trump doesn't mean to murder him either, OMG. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1675.2s)]
*  Neither did dump Biden, okay? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1678.44s)]
*  Neither did a thousand things they said about Biden. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1680.48s)]
*  Anyway, great point. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1682.8799999999999s)]
*  John, what's next? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1683.68s)]
*  Great point, let's jump into the Congress. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1684.64s)]
*  Senator, what do you need to see in this bill to be on board? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1688.48s)]
*  The problem is, is it's asking conservatives like myself to raise the debt [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1692.3200000000002s)]
*  ceiling $5 trillion. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1696.72s)]
*  That's historic, no one's ever raised the debt so that much. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1698.28s)]
*  It's not beautiful, I'm sorry. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1702.92s)]
*  It's not a big beautiful bill, that's called rhetoric. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1704.28s)]
*  There's one thing that- It's a slave one. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1706.72s)]
*  There's one thing that really stupefies me. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1708.28s)]
*  So right there you have two Republican senators who are at least as of right now [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1711.32s)]
*  against Donald Trump's big beautiful bill. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1714.84s)]
*  Although at least one of them seems to be a little bit confused. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1717.56s)]
*  Paul right there was talking about how they shouldn't raise the national debt. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1721.56s)]
*  He seems to think a Democrats in charge cuz that's generally the only time they [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1725.8s)]
*  actually care about that, but I appreciate the consistency in this case. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1729.32s)]
*  In any event, the bill faced a major hurdle today. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1732.52s)]
*  Conversation on it is done for the week. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1736.04s)]
*  And both senators and some Republican representatives seem to have some major [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1739.0s)]
*  misgivings about this bill. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1742.6799999999998s)]
*  Cenk, we're going to dive into all of it, but what do you think is leading to the [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1744.76s)]
*  fact that they're so willing to push back against him? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1747.48s)]
*  Yeah, so there's something super strange going on. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1750.12s)]
*  We'll solve it over the next couple of weeks, but I've literally never seen this. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1753.56s)]
*  Those are two Republican senators arguing against a tax cut for the rich. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1758.52s)]
*  Kind of for the moment being. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1764.9199999999998s)]
*  But again, over 25 years of covering American politics, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1767.16s)]
*  I have never ever seen a Republican be against a tax cut for a rich. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1771.3200000000002s)]
*  So in this case, this is unresolvable because they want to give away [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1775.88s)]
*  at least 5 trillion to the rich. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1780.8400000000001s)]
*  But they don't have that much money to cut, so that means they're gonna put a huge hole [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1783.24s)]
*  in the debt and they're gonna make it much worse. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1787.16s)]
*  Normally what Republicans do is, there is no debt, not when we're in charge. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1790.8400000000001s)]
*  And the tax cuts will magically create revenue. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1796.76s)]
*  They won't take away revenue. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1799.72s)]
*  They just lie through their teeth. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1801.24s)]
*  They don't actually care about balancing budgets or anything. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1802.44s)]
*  So in this situation, we've got something super weird going on, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1804.92s)]
*  which is where Republicans are saying, yeah, this will add to the debt. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1809.56s)]
*  And so are we sure we should do massive multi-trillion dollar tax cuts? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1814.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1818.6s)]
*  I've never seen it before, so I can't explain it. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1819.24s)]
*  This is a new phenomenon. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1822.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1823.16s)]
*  Yeah, and so their problem seems to be on the costing too much side. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1823.64s)]
*  And then we will get to there's some Republicans that are on the, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1827.16s)]
*  we're cutting too much side in terms of Medicaid. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1830.2800000000002s)]
*  And others who grotesquely actually want to cut more. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1833.3200000000002s)]
*  So we're gonna get to all of that. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1836.2s)]
*  But before we jump to the House, let's have a little bit more from the senators about their problem. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1837.72s)]
*  It will be a record for Congress to raise the debt $5 trillion. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1841.4s)]
*  But also it indicates that this year, the deficit will be over 2 trillion. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1846.6000000000001s)]
*  But it means they're anticipating close to 3 trillion for the next year. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1851.4s)]
*  It's really a slap in the face that those of us who are excited about Elon Musk and Doge and all [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1854.8400000000001s)]
*  the cuts, where are the cuts? If the cuts are real, why are we gonna borrow 5 trillion? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1859.96s)]
*  If you raise it 5 trillion for two years, you just put it on the back burner. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1865.0800000000002s)]
*  But we're gonna coast through that money and we're gonna spend it all. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1869.24s)]
*  And that's not what the people want. That's not what our supporters want. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1872.3600000000001s)]
*  This is not serious. It's exacerbating the problem. It's not solving it. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1875.3200000000002s)]
*  I've got a great video on my ex page. All our Republican leaders saying we don't have a revenue [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1878.92s)]
*  problem. We have a spending problem. And this bill is primarily about tax cuts. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1883.8000000000002s)]
*  We can't afford to cut taxes when we're running over $2 trillion a year [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1888.8400000000001s)]
*  deficits for the next 10 years as far as the eye can see. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1893.0s)]
*  The only correction I would make to that is that they also are likely to have a major revenue [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1895.24s)]
*  problem because some estimates say that the massive cuts to the IRS could generate up to [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1900.44s)]
*  $500 billion less in taxes. That's the estimates that I've seen. That remains to be seen. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1905.8s)]
*  We need to figure out what actually happens. But that's the Senate. Over in the House, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1911.1599999999999s)]
*  they did their first vote at the committee level on this bill and it actually failed in the House [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1915.08s)]
*  Budget Committee. Republicans Chip Roy, Ralph Norman, Andrew Clyde, Josh Breachin joined [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1920.6s)]
*  the Democrats to vote down the bill. And so at least for now it has actually failed. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1927.0s)]
*  Now there are some Republicans who've been saying this cuts Medicaid too much. We're worried about [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1932.04s)]
*  the political ramifications of that. Cuts to Medicaid, by the way, are universally reviled. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1936.76s)]
*  The majority of Republicans are against them, let alone independents and Democrats. But that's not [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1941.6399999999999s)]
*  actually why these particular Republicans voted against it. This really, I think, crystallizes [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1946.6s)]
*  the problem that Mike Johnson has that you have those who are worried about it going too far. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1952.2s)]
*  And then you have this group that think that it doesn't go far enough. And they have a variety [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1956.2s)]
*  of different concerns, but here are a few of them. One says they wanna speed up the phase out of [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1960.52s)]
*  clean energy tax credits enacted under Joe Biden, because we wanna really cook this planet as fast [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1966.28s)]
*  as possible. Immediately remove immigrants in the country illegally from any Medicaid access, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1972.04s)]
*  rather than allowing states several years to comply. And moving up the Medicaid work [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1977.6399999999999s)]
*  requirement start date. So rather than giving states four years to phase this in, make it [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1982.6s)]
*  immediate so that the estimated nine to 14 and a half million people who will be thrown off of [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1987.8s)]
*  Medicaid, thanks to this, can be thrown off as soon as possible. Don't let them suck off the [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1993.1599999999999s)]
*  teat of the government for a couple more years. Throw them out in the streets immediately. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=1998.9199999999998s)]
*  Let them start to get sick. Let them start to die. Millions and millions of them being [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2002.9199999999998s)]
*  Trump voters. Make that immediate. Really make the cruelty as fast as possible. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2007.48s)]
*  Anyway, you can see I'm not a big fan of the bill. But anyway, it is suffering a little bit. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2012.28s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2017.0s)]
*  Yeah, so the polling is gonna show you here why the Republicans have an unsolvable riddle, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2017.8s)]
*  okay? So we're gonna get to that in a second. First of all, is this really cutting [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2025.72s)]
*  Medicaid? Yeah, 10 million people are gonna be cut off the rolls. Now, think about [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2031.88s)]
*  the paradox they're setting up here. They're saying, well, we understand you might need [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2038.6s)]
*  Medicaid sometimes. And so that's why we have the program. But you know what? We gotta make [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2042.28s)]
*  sure though that you're going to work and trying your hardest because we don't want any giveaways. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2047.32s)]
*  All right, maybe that sounds reasonable to you, right? And I think in some circumstances, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2052.6s)]
*  I would say, yeah, after a certain amount of time, etc. on some government programs. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2059.24s)]
*  But on Medicaid, the whole point is if you can't afford healthcare, we don't want you to die, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2064.84s)]
*  right? So that's about healthcare, it's not about anything else. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2070.04s)]
*  So and that's absolutely critical. They say now you gotta go get a job. Now the thing is, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2073.24s)]
*  in one of the provisions here, if you get over $15,000, they start cutting your Medicaid. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2077.64s)]
*  $15,000 a year is minimum wage. So if you get a job, they kick you off of Medicaid. If you don't [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2082.92s)]
*  have a job, they kick you off of Medicaid. Perfect system. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2088.92s)]
*  Yeah, because you know why? Because they don't give a damn about you. They just care about the [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2093.08s)]
*  rich. So that's why that what Ron Johnson Rand Paul did this similar line that they usually do. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2098.44s)]
*  The real problem is the cuts we haven't cut from the American people enough to give to my rich [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2104.68s)]
*  donors yet. They're still stuffing their mouths and we need to give them a nice big buffet. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2109.08s)]
*  So we're going to take it from the most needy. So Rand Paul's like he's complaining about the debt, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2113.96s)]
*  but he'll shut up later and he'll pretend that the tax cuts don't create debt. That's my guess. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2119.4s)]
*  That's what they do, like literally 100% of the time until today. Ron Johnson, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2123.4s)]
*  maybe he's just a knucklehead. He's not that bright. Maybe he slipped up and said, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2127.96s)]
*  the tax cuts are too large. He's not supposed to say that. He's supposed to say, no, the tax [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2132.6s)]
*  cuts are great. They will create revenue magically. They will trickle on you later. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2137.96s)]
*  Okay, but he's not saying that. So that's why I'm totally surprised by that. But the rest of the [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2143.32s)]
*  Republicans as usual, they didn't change at all. You think they're more populist? No, they're not [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2147.56s)]
*  populist. You think that they're like it made any difference? No, like so for Trump, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2152.04s)]
*  you can make an argument that he is really trying for peace negotiations. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2157.88s)]
*  You can make a counter argument, right? But it's debatable. On Republicans in Congress, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2163.08s)]
*  in my lifetime, including now with the exception of that one Ron Johnson clip, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2169.8s)]
*  it has been 100% of the time where they say, yeah, no, everything for the rich. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2173.64s)]
*  The biggest tax cuts you can imagine. And how do we get to the $37 trillion in debt? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2178.6s)]
*  Largely through tax cuts for the rich and for corporations. That was the number one reason. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2183.72s)]
*  Spending was number two. Number one is we just keep giving them massive, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2189.4s)]
*  massive multi-trillion dollar tax cuts. You know how much Trump put on the debt last time [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2193.72s)]
*  he was in office? Just four years, $8 trillion. The most of any president in history. Now, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2199.48s)]
*  does the American people know that? And it gets so frustrated because both mainstream media and [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2206.28s)]
*  the Democratic Party. Why didn't you talk about how Trump added $8 trillion to the debt? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2210.52s)]
*  Why didn't you say that every single time? This idiot added $8 trillion to the debt. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2215.4s)]
*  Eight out of the 37 out of our entire history by this moron who can't do math. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2220.84s)]
*  And who's so greedy, he gave himself a whole bunch of tax cuts and all those rich friends, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2228.76s)]
*  a whole bunch of tax cuts and just piled onto the debt. The Democrats instead went. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2233.4s)]
*  And why? Because secretly that goes to our donors too. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2241.32s)]
*  Otherwise you'd fight back and mainstream media is like, well, Republicans say this that [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2247.0s)]
*  $5 trillion in taxes magically creates revenue instead of costing revenue. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2251.96s)]
*  And the Democrats say, so the Republicans are right. No, there are actual facts. So we're gonna [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2256.92s)]
*  get to more here in a second, including the polling that's so important. But is it a Medicaid [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2263.16s)]
*  cut? Yes. And my guess, Moz, is what they're gonna do is what they do every single time, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2267.3199999999997s)]
*  which is they'll get to the finish line. There'll be a lot of fighting. Some will be real, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2272.8399999999997s)]
*  some will be fake. And then at the end, they'll go screw the deficit. Let's give the rich everything. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2277.3999999999996s)]
*  They're not gonna cut the cut, cut. They're gonna make the deficit lower? No way. They're gonna make [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2283.64s)]
*  the deficit much higher. And that's because they can't wait to pay back the bribes that all the [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2291.32s)]
*  rich people gave them to get elected. Moz. Well, Cenk, tariffs are gonna pay for all this. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2298.92s)]
*  What are you talking about? All the tariffs that have been canceled, right? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2305.0s)]
*  First of all, the national debt, $37 trillion. And I like it. I love the national debt because [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2310.28s)]
*  it makes me feel good about my own debt. So that's one thing to keep in mind. Why should [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2317.0s)]
*  we get rid of the national debt? Every time I get my credit card bill, end of the month, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2322.36s)]
*  I'm like, how much did I spend? And I go, well, this is not $37 trillion. So there's that if you're [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2325.08s)]
*  looking for silver lining. But it's amazing how much they're bending over backwards to find ways [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2329.96s)]
*  to be able to excuse this tax cut they're about to give themselves. And it's interesting how the word [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2336.36s)]
*  cut is used for poor, for the poor to cut their programs and benefits. And for the rich, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2342.36s)]
*  it's used to cut their taxes. And it's crazy where they're saying with the tariffs, they're [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2349.8s)]
*  gonna bring money in. Doge was supposed to cut money. Remember, Elon Musk famously said, I'm gonna [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2355.2400000000002s)]
*  cut two or $3 trillion in that rally that he was on stage with. I'm gonna cut trillions of dollars. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2360.1200000000003s)]
*  They're nowhere close to cutting that much. And the programs they cut are programs that benefit [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2365.7200000000003s)]
*  us and we need like USAID and other programs that were helping us. And they never look at, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2371.8s)]
*  for example, defense. They never look at defense because they can't because to your point, there's [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2377.0s)]
*  way too much money going in their pockets from the defense contractors or from the defense lobbyists. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2382.2000000000003s)]
*  And just it's just unbelievable that anyone that is on their side, any constituent that is on their [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2387.32s)]
*  side that is not a very wealthy person is not seeing that they're getting taken to the cleaners [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2394.44s)]
*  and that they're coming up with all of these excuses and all of these smoke, all the smoke and [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2401.24s)]
*  mirror to make it look like we have money coming in. He goes to the Middle East and says, I'm [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2406.68s)]
*  bringing in whatever $12 trillion. He's throwing these numbers around so that his constituents will [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2410.12s)]
*  be like, well, he's bringing in money that way. So yeah, let's give the rich another tax break. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2415.24s)]
*  It is just unbelievable. So they're working on the details of the exact plan now. But in the first [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2419.56s)]
*  cut of the outline of the bill that they did an analysis on, the top 1% was getting what percentage [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2426.52s)]
*  of the tax cuts, let alone the corporate tax cuts, which goes exclusive to corporations, right? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2433.16s)]
*  Was it like 10%? Well, maybe because the top 1% is wealthier. I get it if it's 10%. 20%, well, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2440.6s)]
*  that would be pretty disproportionate. 30% would be ridiculous. Yeah, it was 56%. 56% of the cuts go [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2446.92s)]
*  to the top 1%, the rich that don't need it at all. And they're gonna rob real Americans, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2453.0s)]
*  okay, that desperately need healthcare when their kids are sick. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2460.36s)]
*  They're gonna rob them to pay the richest people in the world. And so this is the great American [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2465.08s)]
*  robbery. Now, here's a problem they have. The polling on this is disastrous on the Medicaid [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2469.96s)]
*  part and on the taxes part, but I'll get back to taxes in a second. I wanna show you Harry Enton, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2476.04s)]
*  and then I'm gonna show you a hilarious Republican faux pas because of this. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2480.68s)]
*  But first, look at the polling that he's pointing out here on CNN. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2484.9199999999996s)]
*  Major spending cuts to Medicaid. Look at this, 76% opposed. You get 95% of Democrats opposed, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2487.56s)]
*  79% of independents. And you even get a majority of Republicans, 55% opposed major spending cuts [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2496.2s)]
*  to Medicaid. This simply put is not popular on any part of the aisle. Do you know somebody or [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2504.8399999999997s)]
*  you yourself ever been on Medicaid or on it currently? And this I think basically says it [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2509.96s)]
*  all has been or is on Medicaid me or someone else close to me. Look at this, 62% of Democrats, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2514.52s)]
*  62% of Republicans. Medicaid is something that touches people from across the political spectrum [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2520.2s)]
*  from the left to the right. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2526.12s)]
*  So that's them going after the average American. And that's why the average American is dead set [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2527.48s)]
*  against this three quarters of the country saying don't cut Medicaid. That's why it was [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2533.4s)]
*  important for the Republicans to rebrand this as a Medicaid reform. So let's go to video B3 [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2538.68s)]
*  of Congressman Jason Smith and see how that rebranding is coming along. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2544.7599999999998s)]
*  You can look at Medicaid cuts, Medicaid reforms, I should say. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2548.2s)]
*  We're gonna cut Medicaid, I mean reform. We're just reforming Medicaid, you know what I'm saying? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2552.9199999999996s)]
*  We're gonna cut like at least 10 million people out of the rolls and they'll be reformed into [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2561.8799999999997s)]
*  probably massive illnesses and maybe their kids dying. But hey, to be fair, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2566.04s)]
*  the top 1% needed another $5 trillion. So that's the sick thing that's going on here. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2570.52s)]
*  So at the end of the day, this is unresolvable. There is no way to cut that much in taxes [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2577.24s)]
*  and to balance the budget. There just isn't enough money. There isn't 5 trillion in the budget to cut. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2585.48s)]
*  And you can't just trying to take it out of Medicaid is unpopular. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2590.7599999999998s)]
*  And last poll for you guys, at least tax cuts are very popular. I've been told by mainstream [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2594.2s)]
*  media my whole life how popular tax cuts are. And that's why the Democrats have to go along. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2600.3599999999997s)]
*  They don't have a choice. There was nothing they could do. There was nothing they could do, right? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2604.52s)]
*  So let's see if that's true. This is from Politico, so that sounds right. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2607.8799999999997s)]
*  76% of registered voters believe the wealthiest Americans should pay more in taxes, more. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2612.9199999999996s)]
*  So reviewing, 76% of Americans say you should not cut Medicaid. And 76% of Americans say you [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2622.36s)]
*  should tax the wealthy more. So instead, the populist Republicans will do the exact opposite. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2629.64s)]
*  Enjoy. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2637.56s)]
*  Ridiculous. Well, I think we should take our second break. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2638.68s)]
*  Another story coming up to end the hour after this. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2641.16s)]
*  Back on TYT, Cenk, Moz and John with you guys. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2668.2s)]
*  Moz, before I forget, where can people see you and touring information and all that? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2684.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm touring all over the country and all over the world. I'll be in Australia this summer. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2690.12s)]
*  I'll be in New York, DC, everywhere. They can go to mozjobrani.com for all the dates or they can [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2694.04s)]
*  follow me on socials at Moz Jobrani and I post funny clips, hopefully. And then come see me tour. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2700.84s)]
*  Hopefully, yes. I hope. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2709.56s)]
*  Listen, with social media now, you put it out there and you think it's funny, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2715.64s)]
*  but then the responses that come in, you're like, wow, people are angry. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2719.56s)]
*  I wouldn't know anything about that. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2723.7200000000003s)]
*  You would not, exactly. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2725.56s)]
*  All right, and everybody check out Damage Report every day at 1 PM Eastern. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2727.4s)]
*  One quick thing before we go to the rest of the stories. Darth Heffey wrote in on Twitch and I [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2732.2000000000003s)]
*  appreciate this and I also appreciate your handle, which is super badass. Anna sniffed out Tulsi when [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2736.2000000000003s)]
*  I started watching TYT in 2019. That's right, she did, because she often sees things before others do [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2741.32s)]
*  and is often punished for it. All right, John. Okay, let's jump into one more story that definitely [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2749.08s)]
*  is not going to utterly enrage Cenk. As I search my heart today in addressing you all, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2753.64s)]
*  my moral and political commitments guide me to say that the only thing that is appropriate to say [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2762.44s)]
*  in this time and to a group this large [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2771.0s)]
*  is a recognition of the atrocities currently happening in Palestine. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2776.36s)]
*  So that was a message, the beginning of a message. We will show you more being delivered [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2781.08s)]
*  as a graduation speech by Logan Rosos at NYU that has resulted in, at least as of right now, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2786.2s)]
*  the withholding of Logan's diploma for saying things that are so incredibly politically incorrect [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2791.8s)]
*  that your four years of education might just be wiped away as a result of it. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2799.24s)]
*  Because they say that he did not comply with school rules when it comes to his speech and [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2803.3999999999996s)]
*  their commitment to those rules is just infinitely larger than their commitment to free speech as a [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2810.2799999999997s)]
*  concept, unfortunately. And we're gonna have a lot to say as some congress people do, which [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2815.7999999999997s)]
*  we will also reveal to you. But first, we wanna give you more of what Logan had to say. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2820.52s)]
*  The genocide currently occurring [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2824.52s)]
*  is supported politically and militarily by the United States, is paid for by our tax dollars, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2829.16s)]
*  and has been live streamed to our phones for the past 18 months. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2836.44s)]
*  I condemn this genocide and complicity in this genocide. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2839.48s)]
*  Obviously unacceptable, should probably be locked up. But when Logan initially talked about the [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2843.56s)]
*  genocide, there were a number of people he heard applauded. They were actually apparently in the [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2852.28s)]
*  wider shot. There were some faculty members that applauded as well, although there were some boos [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2856.52s)]
*  too, both in the room and now coming from some representatives, including Representative Jared [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2862.28s)]
*  Moskowitz, who said he lied to the university. Second of all, he lied to everyone listening. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2868.6800000000003s)]
*  There's no genocide going on in Israel. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2874.92s)]
*  What a liar Moskowitz is, ridiculous. He's gonna do an anti-Semitic trope in a minute, keep going. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2877.8s)]
*  There is a war, it's unfortunate, seems to break his heart. And there are people in harm's way [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2885.56s)]
*  because of what Hamas did. Only Hamas, it is a one-sided conflict, no one else has done [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2890.84s)]
*  anything wrong. Enthusiastic, it was Hamas that set off that gender reveal bomb in a building, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2896.44s)]
*  I suppose. Yes, there are situations that I wish would improve like getting more food into Gaza, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2901.64s)]
*  which is just an abstract problem. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2908.8399999999997s)]
*  Nobody's causing it. Nobody's responsible for the food not getting in there. It's just like, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2911.08s)]
*  it's far, the roads aren't great. Nobody's blocking the food or the water or the medicine. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2916.6s)]
*  Nobody's targeting places where it's distributed, where refugees come to get the food. Nobody's [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2923.48s)]
*  blowing up the hospitals. It's all just an act of God. Well, maybe not God. It's an act of nature, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2928.12s)]
*  I suppose. It's an abstract problem that you can feel bad about in an abstract way. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2933.88s)]
*  But don't talk about it. Don't talk about it in front of a group of educated, passionate, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2938.6s)]
*  young people that clearly enjoyed hearing that message. Don't do that. He concludes by saying, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2944.6s)]
*  but at the end of the day, that's up to the university, whether they give him his diploma [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2950.2s)]
*  or not. In fact, they can give him his diploma. It's not going to matter. Good luck getting a job. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2953.4s)]
*  That was a stupid, selfish thing. Ruined the ceremony for a lot of families. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2960.44s)]
*  Here we were trying to enjoy the genocide. And all of a sudden you come and ruin it by telling [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2965.96s)]
*  us it's a genocide. It was selfish. He made it all about him. Yeah. Well, not him. Civilians [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2971.1600000000003s)]
*  being killed in Gaza, but that's selfish. I mean, he's just making it about the 53,000 [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2976.12s)]
*  already murdered, including 18,000 children and the 2.2 million people being starved to [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2981.4s)]
*  death over the last two and a half months. You see how selfish he is? When me, a lover of Israel, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2986.6800000000003s)]
*  says that his whole life should be canceled, not just his diploma, but he should never get a job [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2992.92s)]
*  again. That's not me being selfish. No, no, no, no, no, no. Look, they would have done this if [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=2997.48s)]
*  he'd criticized Norway or if he'd criticized cantaloupes. It was just because he lied that [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3004.28s)]
*  they were so upset. Yeah, sure. It just happens to be about Israel again. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3011.96s)]
*  Interesting. So, okay, did you notice the anti-Semitic trope he did there? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3019.2400000000002s)]
*  Basically saying you'll never get a job again. But wait a minute, that's what people say about [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3023.8s)]
*  Jews. If you ever say anything against Israel, Jews will make sure that you never work again. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3031.24s)]
*  Jews will make sure of this, that, and the other thing. And we say that doesn't happen. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3037.3999999999996s)]
*  And here's Jared Moskowitz, a Democratic congressman saying, no, it will happen. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3041.64s)]
*  We'll make sure that you never get a job if you ever criticize Israel or you're honest about [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3047.72s)]
*  Israel. That's one of the most anti-Semitic things a congressman's ever said. Are they [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3052.9199999999996s)]
*  gonna censure him? What do you mean he's never gonna get a job? How would you know that? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3058.92s)]
*  Are you gonna go and talk to every single person who could possibly hire [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3063.88s)]
*  millions and millions of people? What does it mean that you know that he won't be able to get a job? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3067.32s)]
*  And by the way, it's not theoretical. Billionaires like Bill Ackman have said, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3073.32s)]
*  for anyone going to peace protests, peace protests, that he circulated a memo in [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3080.2000000000003s)]
*  Wall Street saying never hire them. If they dare cross Israel in any way, shape or form, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3086.68s)]
*  if they dare be for peace, if they dare say that Israel starving children to death is a problem, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3093.08s)]
*  make sure they never work again. But I mean, what are you talking about? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3100.68s)]
*  But if you said, hey, Bill, aren't you doing the trope? You'd be like, anti-Semite? Come on, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3103.3999999999996s)]
*  that's not anti-Semitic. You know what is actually bigoted when you say, oh, this guy minds [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3109.96s)]
*  two million people being starved to death. They're only Muslims, who cares? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3116.44s)]
*  I mean, I care a little bit. What a tragic starvation. But don't ever mention it, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3120.28s)]
*  otherwise you'll never work again. You're doing so much damage, not only to everyone, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3126.28s)]
*  not only to this country. And by the way, if you're a US congressman, maybe you read the [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3130.92s)]
*  Constitution. You know the freedom of speech thing, a tiny little thing, the First Amendment? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3135.7200000000003s)]
*  There's no asterisks unless you criticize my beloved Israel. And yes, I work for them and [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3141.24s)]
*  not the US government. I said it. Why don't you concentrate on the US government, Jared Moskowitz? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3146.6s)]
*  Instead of somebody, not in Congress, at an NYU graduation and not in Florida, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3152.44s)]
*  where he's the congressman, but in New York, said one thing criticizing Israel, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3158.44s)]
*  as they're in the middle of the worst war crimes we've ever seen in our lifetime. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3163.48s)]
*  Yeah, you better not. There'll be consequences, Moskowitz says. He does more damage to Jews in [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3168.92s)]
*  America than anyone else can do. You gotta cut that kind of talk out, man. Jesus Christ. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3175.96s)]
*  We're trying to make sure that anti-Semitism doesn't rise while we make sure that Israel [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3182.7599999999998s)]
*  doesn't keep killing Palestinians. Those are both very hard tasks. But you're not helping [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3186.6s)]
*  when you go around. If you cross us, Jews will make sure you don't get a job. Why do you say that? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3191.8s)]
*  Why do you say that? That's so stupid. Now, when you go and I go and debate whoever the hell comes [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3196.68s)]
*  up, right? The Alex Joneses of the world, not that I'm going to do that. But when they pop up [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3202.92s)]
*  at different things and they say, what do you mean? Moskowitz says they won't give them a job. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3207.72s)]
*  And Bill Ackman literally wrote a memo saying they're not allowed to get a job. They cancel [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3212.04s)]
*  their careers. They arrest them. They deport them. What do you mean? How can you say that [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3215.96s)]
*  they're not doing this when they're admitting doing it? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3221.48s)]
*  Moskowitz, you're not supposed to say it out loud, you moron. And what are you gonna do? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3224.52s)]
*  That's your threat. That's your threat. So are you gonna go and call up [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3230.1200000000003s)]
*  Wall Street and go, make sure you don't hire this guy. He criticized Israel. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3233.5600000000004s)]
*  Cancel him, cancel him, cancel him. Is that what you're gonna do? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3237.0800000000004s)]
*  Because that's what you said. That's what you said. Okay, so no, in this country, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3240.28s)]
*  God help you. God help you if you criticize Israel. Because these are the monsters out there, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3246.6800000000003s)]
*  Moskowitz, who think genocide is no big deal. Starving kids to death is no big deal. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3252.76s)]
*  But saying that we're starving them to death, saying that it's a genocide, huge deal, huge deal. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3260.84s)]
*  You should never work again. No, brother, if you're pro-genocide like you obviously are, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3267.2400000000002s)]
*  you should never work again. The people in that district should fire you. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3272.6000000000004s)]
*  But okay, did I criticize Israel? Go ahead, Moskowitz, go ahead, go ahead. Even though you [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3277.32s)]
*  are the one who said the anti-Semitic trope. I know what you're gonna say, because it's what [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3282.04s)]
*  every vicious supporter of Israel says. Not every supporter of Israel is vicious. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3285.08s)]
*  People like Moskowitz are vicious. You're gonna say, I got a one trick pony, anti-Semite. No one [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3291.0s)]
*  should hire Cenk again. I'm gonna call everybody, make sure that he's not hired. Okay, I'm Moskowitz. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3297.96s)]
*  I'm in charge of the country, okay? No one is allowed to criticize my beloved Israel. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3302.84s)]
*  You'll all be fired. By the way, I don't do cast culture. I don't do anything like that. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3307.08s)]
*  Is that right? Because it certainly looks like it. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3311.0s)]
*  I mean, first of all, that kid was very courageous. Good for him for taking that [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3326.36s)]
*  opportunity to stand in front of all those people and say what he said. And we should [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3331.8s)]
*  be celebrating that as Americans, no matter what side you stand on with Israel and Palestine, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3335.88s)]
*  you should be celebrating his freedom of speech to say that and his courage [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3340.84s)]
*  to stand up there and actually say it. Now, there was a funny moment if you look at the video, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3344.6800000000003s)]
*  where there was a faculty behind him. And when he said something about the genocide, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3351.1600000000003s)]
*  the faculty, the guy just puts his head down. He's like, no, here we go. But hey, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3354.76s)]
*  this kid was courageous to stand up there and say that. And the truth is, when it comes to Moskowitz, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3360.36s)]
*  there's a lot of stuff I've seen of Moskowitz that I like. I think that he does a good job. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3365.32s)]
*  But in this case, you're absolutely right. What is he talking about? The fact is, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3369.48s)]
*  they jump on anything that you say. This kid was up there saying, look, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3375.96s)]
*  I have to take this moment to stand up for justice in this case. And I don't care, again, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3381.48s)]
*  whether you're Israeli or you're Jewish or you're Muslim or you're Palestinian. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3386.04s)]
*  We are seeing these killings of innocent people and women and children and it continues and it [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3390.6s)]
*  keeps going. And you gotta call it out. And I'm surprised at how the blind spot that so many [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3396.68s)]
*  people like Moskowitz have when it comes to this. Where's the humanity? Where is the sympathy that [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3404.68s)]
*  they feel for other people inside this country or around the world? And it just somehow gets lost. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3412.68s)]
*  You can't even say ceasefire. You say ceasefire, they go, how dare you say ceasefire? You want [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3419.48s)]
*  Hamas to kill us? No, I don't want Hamas to kill you. I want the hostages to come back. I want the [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3424.12s)]
*  killings to stop. I want the place to be rebuilt. We all want a solution. We want a peaceful solution. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3428.92s)]
*  But if you look at the facts and you look at Netanyahu and you look at his cabinet and you [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3434.28s)]
*  see that they're far right and they do want the annihilation of Palestinians, then you understand [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3438.36s)]
*  what this kid is talking about and you call a spade a spade. So it's upsetting to me to see [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3442.92s)]
*  some people who are on the left who don't see that. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3448.84s)]
*  I agree. Can we have a couple of points? Yeah, first of all, there's the genocide that we've [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3454.36s)]
*  all witnessed. We just have. If you can't identify this as a year and a half long series [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3460.2000000000003s)]
*  of intentional war crimes, then war crimes just don't exist anymore in an objective sense. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3465.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe people you hate can commit war crimes, but there's nothing that's objectively a war crime if [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3469.8s)]
*  what we've seen doesn't count. Let alone that Mosquitos knows that Donald Trump has already [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3473.8s)]
*  announced that they're going to ethnically cleanse Gaza. They're going to ship everyone out. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3478.52s)]
*  They're gonna pack them in cargo containers, send them to some slum somewhere and steal all [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3482.36s)]
*  their land. And everybody's just pretending that that's not a thing that Donald Trump has [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3486.52s)]
*  promised multiple times. It has not been discussed in the Israeli government [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3489.7200000000003s)]
*  already. But in terms of the message, let's also acknowledge that this is to some extent a [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3493.6400000000003s)]
*  consequence of the overall icing of free speech that we've experienced as a society. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3499.16s)]
*  NYU is terrified that if he did this speech, if it gets out, that federal funding can be [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3506.2s)]
*  cut to the university and everyone at the top will be fired. And the reason they believe that [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3512.8399999999997s)]
*  is because that's what the Trump administration is doing. And so the reason the Trump administration [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3517.56s)]
*  does it is so that then they're not the only ones that have stifled free speech. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3521.24s)]
*  But the NYU will try to stifle free speech. Everyone will be so terrified that the massive [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3524.68s)]
*  implacable boot of government will crush anyone who defies them that they then do the censoring [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3529.96s)]
*  for them. So I think that's part of why NYU has freaked out so much. But in one final little [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3535.8799999999997s)]
*  ironic thing, it's so interesting how incentives work out. Because Logan's goal, I assume, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3541.0s)]
*  was for as many people as possible to hear his message. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3547.72s)]
*  And the best he could probably hope for was the people in the room, maybe a TikTok or whatever. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3551.16s)]
*  And I don't remember what the principle is. Was it Bette Midler or whatever that didn't want [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3555.48s)]
*  photos getting out of her house or something? So she kept suing people and so a billion times [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3558.6s)]
*  more people saw the photos than would have otherwise seen it. If they hadn't freaked out, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3562.84s)]
*  who would know about the speech? Let me ask you a question. This is a graduation ceremony. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3567.72s)]
*  This has been graduation ceremonies at a lot of universities. What was said at the Rutgers [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3572.2799999999997s)]
*  graduation speech? Or BU, Villanova? I don't know because nobody freaked out about it. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3576.6s)]
*  But you guys freaked out about it. So many, many, many times more people will see it. There's a very [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3583.24s)]
*  real chance Logan Roses becomes a political player now as a result of this. At least he's [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3588.7599999999998s)]
*  gonna be interviewed by a bunch of people. So they have maybe unknowingly made his message [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3594.36s)]
*  a thousand times more in terms of its reach. And by the way, of course, you didn't hear about [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3599.3199999999997s)]
*  Rutgers or Villanova or anything like that cuz nobody criticized Israel. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3604.12s)]
*  But if you criticize Israel, then you're gonna have hell to pay. And this is America. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3607.4s)]
*  This is America. By the way, if you criticize America, there'd be no controversy at all. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3612.2799999999997s)]
*  You can say the worst things in the world about America. That's not gonna get you in any trouble. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3616.04s)]
*  So to John's point, okay, everybody's terrified because Trump is saying I'm gonna cancel your [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3619.7999999999997s)]
*  funding, etc, etc. And then Moskowitz, who's a Democrat, goes, let me help Donald Trump in [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3625.72s)]
*  terrifying everyone. Not only could NYU have all your funding pooled because of my beloved [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3631.24s)]
*  friend Donald Trump here who agrees with the genocide of Netanyahu and me, meaning that [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3636.9199999999996s)]
*  Moskowitz and Trump agree with Netanyahu's genocide. If you don't cry and tell me you [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3642.3599999999997s)]
*  don't agree with it, you obviously agree with it. In fact, you think that anyone who even mentions [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3646.68s)]
*  it should be canceled. So Moskowitz goes, let me help Donald Trump in terrifying everyone. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3651.4799999999996s)]
*  If you mention it, I'll make sure you never get a job. You don't get your diploma. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3656.52s)]
*  Me and all my powerful friends, he says, which I don't believe. But he's trying to terrify you [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3659.96s)]
*  and say, ha ha ha ha, the Jews run the world and we'll make sure you never get a job no matter [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3666.04s)]
*  where you go. Well, I don't believe you, Representative Moskowitz. I don't think that's [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3670.76s)]
*  how the world works at all, right? But you're using that threat in a sick, disgusting way [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3674.12s)]
*  that drives up anti-Semitism. And I don't want anybody to think this is about [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3680.84s)]
*  religion. Governments do terrible things, Netanyahu. And you said Trump, forget Trump, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3684.44s)]
*  Netanyahu and the cabinet have voted saying there will never be a Palestinian state. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3689.56s)]
*  Now, Netanyahu has said we're going to do an all out conquest of Gaza Strip. We told you it was [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3693.88s)]
*  always to take the land and now they've proved us right. But Moskowitz will say no, no, they [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3698.6s)]
*  accidentally took the land. Hamas made us take the land. Hamas made us destroy every hospital, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3703.08s)]
*  every school in Gaza. They made us starve Palestinian kids to death. They made us do it. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3709.0s)]
*  We're so innocent and moral, right? And by the way, Moskowitz, it's not we, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3714.44s)]
*  you're a US congressman. You're not an Israeli Knesset member, okay? But here in America, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3718.44s)]
*  there's beautiful, brave, bold Jewish Americans who are fighting back for peace and decency. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3724.84s)]
*  What do they want? They want the same thing I want, a safe haven for Jews in Israel [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3730.76s)]
*  and an independent and free Palestine. Ben Cohen just got arrested in Congress. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3734.44s)]
*  Yeah. That's an American hero. Robert Greenwald doing a movie about [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3738.44s)]
*  how Palestinian journalists are getting killed. And well, every kind of journalist is getting [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3742.6800000000003s)]
*  killed in Gaza in record numbers. Dave Smith and Bernie Sanders and the list goes on and on. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3747.08s)]
*  So don't think it's the Jews, it's not. It's just monsters like Moskowitz who think that [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3753.6400000000003s)]
*  a genocide is no big deal. And if you do enough propaganda, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3759.7200000000003s)]
*  you'll be able to run cover for his beloved Israel. Well, Moskowitz, if it's so beloved to you, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3763.6400000000003s)]
*  why didn't you go, okay? Because we love this country, okay? We wanna serve this country. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3769.24s)]
*  For example, I came from Turkey and I don't know where Moskowitz is from. I assume he was born here, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3776.68s)]
*  right? I was actually born in Turkey, and I lived there till I was eight. So normally you say more [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3782.12s)]
*  allegiance, right? Well, Erdogan is stealing democracy from Turkey. I'm criticizing the [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3787.24s)]
*  Turkish government. Can you criticize a government of your own ethnicity? Is that allowed? You can, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3791.7999999999997s)]
*  of course you can if you're not biased and you're actually an American and you use objective [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3798.76s)]
*  judgment, but not for Moskowitz. But here's the thing, Congressman Ben Cohen, Robert Greenwald, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3804.2000000000003s)]
*  us, every decent person can say never again. You on the other hand, don't tell me never again, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3810.6800000000003s)]
*  but with an asterisk. It's okay if it's Palestinians, cuz I'm racist against them. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3817.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think they're the violent ones as we just murdered 53,000 people. And if you say, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3822.5200000000004s)]
*  it's not murder, there's some Hamas in there. How about the 18,000 kids? I know you've got [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3827.16s)]
*  some sort of abuse. Hamas made us murder 18,000 kids. And yes, it's murder when you drop a bomb [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3831.96s)]
*  on a child and you light them on fire. Or a concrete slab comes and crushes their head [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3838.92s)]
*  and kills that baby. That's murder. Don't tell me you didn't intend to do it when Israel killed [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3844.52s)]
*  18,000 children. That was 18,000 mistakes? No, it wasn't. No rational human being believes that. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3851.88s)]
*  Only propagandists for a sick genocidal government believe that. And that is not all [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3860.6800000000003s)]
*  Israeli governments. That is the current genocidal Israeli government that has announced, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3866.2000000000003s)]
*  yes, we're going to push them out. We're gonna ethnically cleanse them. We're gonna steal that [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3871.96s)]
*  land. But if you say things that are true that they themselves said and voted on, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3877.16s)]
*  Muscovites will say, you're never gonna work in America again. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3881.8799999999997s)]
*  No, no, you don't get to decide that. You don't speak for all Jews. You don't speak for all [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3885.72s)]
*  Americans. You don't speak for anyone except monsters who love genocide. That's who representative [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3890.12s)]
*  Muscovites is. Yeah, I know, Maz is right. I've seen him do other things. That's clever. He's [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3896.68s)]
*  got fun little sneakers. And I was fine and I've complimented him in the past. But if you're gonna [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3900.8399999999997s)]
*  come here and threaten all Americans to take away our freedoms and our rights on behalf of [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3905.16s)]
*  another government, then you can kindly F off. Young Turks. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpxn1rytRQA&t=3911.16s)]
