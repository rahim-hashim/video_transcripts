"Without seeking approval of the San Francisco Board of Education, Superintendent of Schools Maria Su plans to unveil a new Grading for Equity plan on Tuesday that will go into effect this fall at 14 high schools and cover over 10,000 students. The school district is already negotiating with an outside consultant to train teachers in August in a system that awards a passing C grade to as low as a score of 41 on a 100-point exam. "

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.
TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# San Francisco Superintendent GIVES UP On Students With AWFUL Plan

*  ourselves on the back with this [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  ridiculous label of equity. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=22.3s)]
*  This isn't equity, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=24.1s)]
*  this is giving up on students. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=25.48s)]
*  San Francisco's superintendent [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=27.86s)]
*  of schools has decided to quietly [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=29.9s)]
*  implement a new system known as [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=32.339999999999996s)]
*  grading for equity, which severely [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=34.66s)]
*  lowers grading standards and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=37.46s)]
*  will impact approximately 100,000 [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=39.7s)]
*  high school students in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=42.62s)]
*  the city of San Francisco. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=44.42s)]
*  Now, Superintendent Maria Sue [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  didn't even bother seeking any [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  approval from the San Francisco [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  Board of Education before moving [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=53.18s)]
*  forward on this, in my opinion, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  terrible agenda. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=57.82s)]
*  Now, the voice of San Francisco, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  which reported on this story, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=62.82s)]
*  argues that grading for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=64.94s)]
*  equity de-emphasizes the importance [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=66.86s)]
*  of timely performance, meaning [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=69.86s)]
*  turning in your assignments on [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=72.32s)]
*  time, completion of assignments, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=74.58s)]
*  meaning finishing your assignments, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=77.38s)]
*  and consistent attendance. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=80.42s)]
*  So those three things are [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=84.5s)]
*  de-emphasized in regard to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=86.62s)]
*  the final grade students will get. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=88.96s)]
*  Because hey, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  we're grading for equity. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=92.0s)]
*  Let's pause for a second and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=93.72s)]
*  just acknowledge the fact that what [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=95.36s)]
*  this curriculum messages to the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=97.58s)]
*  world is, we don't think certain [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  students can rise to the occasion. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=102.08s)]
*  And so instead of finding ways to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  solve any issues that are standing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  in the way of them, excel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=110.32s)]
*  Rather than doing something about [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=112.56s)]
*  those obstacles, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=114.96s)]
*  we are going to lower the standards [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=116.86s)]
*  and then pat ourselves on the back [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=119.14s)]
*  with this ridiculous label of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=121.52s)]
*  equity. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=123.78s)]
*  This isn't equity. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  This is giving up on students, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=126.22s)]
*  okay? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=128.46s)]
*  So let me give you more details [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  about this because this specific [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=131.42s)]
*  curriculum includes, well, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=133.85999999999999s)]
*  grading for equity eliminates [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=136.1s)]
*  homework or weekly tests from being [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=138.46s)]
*  counted in a student's final [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=141.1s)]
*  semester grade. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=143.26s)]
*  Grades won't be impacted due to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=145.06s)]
*  late assignments, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=146.72s)]
*  showing up late to class or [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=147.78s)]
*  not showing up at all. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=149.18s)]
*  Only the score on a final exam [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=150.34s)]
*  counts, which by the way, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=152.78s)]
*  students can take multiple times. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=154.96s)]
*  So if you didn't like your original [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=158.02s)]
*  score, you can take it again until [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  you get a score you like. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=161.94s)]
*  But there's also a catch to the way [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=163.5s)]
*  these tests are scored. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  Because a student right now in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=167.86s)]
*  a regular traditional grading [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=170.02s)]
*  system would need a new grade [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=172.22s)]
*  and would need a 90 in order to get [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=174.3s)]
*  an A or at least 61 to get a D. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=176.58s)]
*  Well, under the San Landro Unified [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=178.66s)]
*  School District's grading for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=181.22s)]
*  equity system touted by the San [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=183.32s)]
*  Francisco Unified School District [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=185.42s)]
*  and its consultant, a student with [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=187.9s)]
*  a score as low as 80 can attain an [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=190.62s)]
*  A and as low as 21%, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=193.22s)]
*  21% can pass with a D. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=195.26s)]
*  So this is a very, very, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=197.46s)]
*  very, very, very, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=199.78s)]
*  very low grade, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=202.14s)]
*  very low grade, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=203.7s)]
*  and they can pass with a D. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=205.06s)]
*  I think that's crazy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=207.42s)]
*  So the school district is already [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=209.1s)]
*  negotiating with a consultant who [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=211.5s)]
*  is set to train the teachers about [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  grading for equity by August, and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=216.94s)]
*  the dude is a total idiot. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=219.74s)]
*  If you don't believe me, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=221.94s)]
*  I'll give you some of his quotes. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=223.14s)]
*  In fact, the consultant they're [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=224.94s)]
*  referring to is the guy behind this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  grading for equity program. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  His name is Joe Feldman, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=231.78s)]
*  the consultant. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=233.38s)]
*  He wrote in 2019 that in Placer [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=234.62s)]
*  County, another jurisdiction with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=236.82s)]
*  the grading system, students who [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  did not qualify for free or [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  reduced price lunch had a sharper [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  decrease in A's reflecting how [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=246.34s)]
*  traditional grading practices [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=248.62s)]
*  disproportionately benefit students [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  with resources because of the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=253.9s)]
*  inequitable inclusion of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=255.98s)]
*  extra credit and other resource [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=257.9s)]
*  dependent grading criteria. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  What? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=262.38s)]
*  That statement made no sense. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=263.88s)]
*  Okay, so if your argument is [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=266.82s)]
*  students who don't qualify for [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=268.82s)]
*  free or reduced price lunch tend to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=270.82s)]
*  come from affluent families who [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=273.18s)]
*  have more resources. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=275.42s)]
*  They could pay for tutoring, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=276.94s)]
*  they could pay for extra things [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  that help their kids excel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=280.53999999999996s)]
*  All right, we're having an [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=282.3s)]
*  interesting conversation. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=283.58s)]
*  But then he weirdly says, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=284.86s)]
*  but then he weirdly pivoted to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=286.66s)]
*  extra credit opportunities. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=289.06s)]
*  Yeah, teachers offer extra credit [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=293.66s)]
*  opportunities to everybody in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=295.18s)]
*  the class. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=296.42s)]
*  So I don't know how he's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=297.14000000000004s)]
*  connecting those two things. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=298.66s)]
*  But again, if a teacher offers [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=300.70000000000005s)]
*  extra credit, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=302.66s)]
*  it's offered to everyone in that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  class. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=305.66s)]
*  And I don't understand the point [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=306.74s)]
*  that he's trying to make here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=308.54s)]
*  This whole grading for [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=310.22s)]
*  equity scheme is a big racket, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  by the way, for Feldman himself. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=313.18s)]
*  And consultants like him. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=315.62s)]
*  He's the CEO of something called [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=317.82s)]
*  Crescendo Education Group, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=320.14s)]
*  which works with schools and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=322.18s)]
*  systems on grading practices. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  And he's selling a product. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=326.5s)]
*  I believe that product is snake [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  oil. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=329.82s)]
*  So I looked at his website, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=330.32s)]
*  very curious to see what kind of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=331.94s)]
*  services they offer. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=333.65999999999997s)]
*  So you're taking a look at [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=335.09999999999997s)]
*  a screenshot from their website as [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=336.74s)]
*  we speak, it says, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=339.02s)]
*  build teacher capacity for [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  improved grading. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=342.02s)]
*  So they offer workshops. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=343.74s)]
*  In the middle there, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=345.78000000000003s)]
*  they talk about one on one coaching [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=346.94s)]
*  that they offer. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=348.82000000000005s)]
*  Their consultants can coach [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  the teachers of this school [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  district so they know how to lower [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=352.90000000000003s)]
*  standards for the entirety of their [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  classroom and somehow rebrand that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=356.86s)]
*  as equity. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=359.02000000000004s)]
*  And then they offer online classes [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=361.26000000000005s)]
*  as well. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=363.18s)]
*  So these are all services you can [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=363.94s)]
*  pay for, it's a for [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=365.74s)]
*  profit private company. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=366.74s)]
*  Feldman, a former teacher and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=369.22s)]
*  principal with degrees from [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=371.02000000000004s)]
*  Harvard, NYU and Harvard. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=372.78s)]
*  Institutions that would never admit [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=374.5s)]
*  students who were able to pass [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=377.42s)]
*  high school but performed so [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=379.82s)]
*  poorly on their SATs because they [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=382.14s)]
*  maybe didn't learn anything thanks [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=384.58s)]
*  to this grading for [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  equity program. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=388.62s)]
*  So he charges as much as $10,000 [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=390.18s)]
*  per day for his consulting work, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=393.78s)]
*  $10,000 a day, okay. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=397.3s)]
*  Okay, education consultants say [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=401.62s)]
*  their fee averages between $5,000 [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=403.66s)]
*  and $10,000 a day. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=406.26s)]
*  Feldman says he might charge [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=407.94s)]
*  a couple $100,000 to help a district [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=410.3s)]
*  roll out his program over three [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=413.46s)]
*  years. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=415.98s)]
*  Quote, we are not making much [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=416.94s)]
*  money, he said. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=419.02s)]
*  If people think I'm buying a boat, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=420.62s)]
*  that is not happening. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=422.74s)]
*  I'm not trying to gouge districts, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=424.22s)]
*  you're getting paid $10,000 a day. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=426.1s)]
*  How many? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=427.94s)]
*  $10,000 a day. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=429.46s)]
*  It's not, it's like I can afford [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=436.02s)]
*  a yacht, okay. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=437.98s)]
*  Look, as you guys can tell, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=440.98s)]
*  this stuff really infuriates me. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=442.58s)]
*  And the reason why it infuriates [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=444.78s)]
*  me is because I'm sick of people [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=446.98s)]
*  grifting off very real issues that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=449.06s)]
*  we have in this country when it [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=451.42s)]
*  comes to inequality. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=453.42s)]
*  They have no interest in [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=455.65999999999997s)]
*  solving inequality. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=456.62s)]
*  In fact, they make inequality [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=457.42s)]
*  worse, especially in this instance [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=459.14000000000004s)]
*  where if a school district goes [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=461.38s)]
*  along with this, kids are not going [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=463.46000000000004s)]
*  to be equipped with what is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=466.02000000000004s)]
*  necessary to succeed in life. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=468.02000000000004s)]
*  Because let me tell you something, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=470.58000000000004s)]
*  every single day I'm expected to be [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=473.70000000000005s)]
*  on camera, camera ready, researched, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=476.58000000000004s)]
*  ready to go, 3 PM Pacific, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=479.94s)]
*  6 PM Eastern, every single day. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=482.54s)]
*  I would venture to say that if I [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=485.3s)]
*  just show up at like 330, 4 o'clock, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=487.74s)]
*  show up whenever I want, maybe my [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=490.7s)]
*  audience would not appreciate that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=493.14s)]
*  Because in real life, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=495.98s)]
*  you don't get graded on a curve, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=497.38s)]
*  okay? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=499.34000000000003s)]
*  In real life, there are expectations [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=499.86s)]
*  and you're supposed to meet those [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=501.7s)]
*  expectations. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=503.34000000000003s)]
*  And this guy, through his grift, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=504.14s)]
*  in my opinion, is totally screwing [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=506.5s)]
*  these students over. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=508.94s)]
*  So Feldman also forces teachers [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=510.34000000000003s)]
*  that he trained to be like, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=512.34s)]
*  teachers that he trains to buy his [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=513.9399999999999s)]
*  book for the trainings. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=516.18s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=517.86s)]
*  The syllabus for [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=520.9s)]
*  professional development program, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=521.54s)]
*  Grading for Equity, says it was [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=523.18s)]
*  designed to support educators in [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=524.74s)]
*  understanding the why and how of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=526.42s)]
*  implementing equitable grading [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=528.1s)]
*  practices. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=529.6999999999999s)]
*  It required teachers to read [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=530.4599999999999s)]
*  the book Grading for Equity by Joe [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=531.86s)]
*  Feldman and discuss it during [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=533.5799999999999s)]
*  monthly faculty meetings. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=535.02s)]
*  The course syllabus contains [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=536.5799999999999s)]
*  several links to resources, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=538.02s)]
*  including reading assignments, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=539.46s)]
*  TED Talks, and podcasts about [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=541.1s)]
*  eliminating grading or changing [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=542.6999999999999s)]
*  the current grading system. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=544.4599999999999s)]
*  And those resources is a slide [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=546.14s)]
*  showing navigating resistance and [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=547.54s)]
*  how to respond to people who are [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=549.3399999999999s)]
*  critical of equity initiatives in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=550.9s)]
*  different scenarios. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=552.66s)]
*  The slide reads, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=553.86s)]
*  a common refrain from white people [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=554.74s)]

*  resistance is, but [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=557.66s)]
*  I grew up poor. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=558.6999999999999s)]
*  The slide recommends using other [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=559.9s)]
*  people in the room to, quote, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=561.54s)]
*  dilute the fairness seeker's voice. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=563.02s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=567.38s)]
*  How about maybe addressing [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=568.5s)]
*  the substantive argument being [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=571.14s)]
*  made, but they can't, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=573.58s)]
*  they can't address it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=575.3s)]
*  So instead, they literally direct [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=576.82s)]
*  other people in the room to start [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=579.22s)]

*  the person who's raising a concern. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=583.46s)]
*  I mean, if you had a substantive [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=585.94s)]
*  rebuttal or response, you would [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=588.26s)]
*  engage in that response, but [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=590.74s)]
*  it appears there isn't a [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=592.86s)]
*  substantive rebuttal. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=594.66s)]
*  In fact, if this is such a great [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=596.58s)]
*  curriculum and such a great idea, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=598.54s)]

*  the DL? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=615.6999999999999s)]
*  Interesting, right? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=616.2199999999999s)]
*  It is, by the way, buried in [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=618.3399999999999s)]

*  life. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=666.18s)]
*  Teachers will have a choice to [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=666.68s)]
*  utilize grading for [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=668.34s)]
*  equity this fall, so [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=669.5s)]

*  But once a school district [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=672.54s)]

*  I've told this story before I'm [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=720.9s)]
*  going to say it again. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=722.5s)]
*  I was a very, very sensitive and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=723.46s)]

*  I entered fifth grade just, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=727.94s)]
*  I was pity party Anna, okay? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=730.22s)]
*  Just didn't think I was capable of [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=732.5400000000001s)]
*  anything, felt sorry for myself. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=734.94s)]

*  her name was Miss Robson, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=739.82s)]

*  she was a hard ass. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=742.94s)]
*  And she had no interest in anyone's [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=744.9399999999999s)]
*  pity party. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=747.14s)]
*  She had a massive sign in the front [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=748.6999999999999s)]
*  of the classroom that said, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=750.5s)]
*  I can and I will. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=751.9399999999999s)]
*  She didn't want to hear any whining. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=753.78s)]
*  She told every single student in [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=755.78s)]
*  that classroom that she believed [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=757.9s)]
*  that we were all capable of [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=760.0999999999999s)]
*  excellence. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=761.78s)]
*  And when you have educators tell [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=763.5s)]
*  you that they believe in you, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=765.26s)]

*  that motivates students. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=770.38s)]
*  When students know that they can [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=772.5799999999999s)]

*  geez, this is incredible. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=785.68s)]
*  So parents would absolutely push [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=788.06s)]
*  back on this plan and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=790.1s)]

*  to college and didn't know how to [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=917.5400000000001s)]

*  I'm not saying the teachers need to [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=956.4200000000001s)]

*  To help students catch up, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=971.86s)]

*  excellence from students in America. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=977.1s)]
*  Instead, we're lowering standards, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=979.86s)]
*  by the way, to the detriment of our [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=982.06s)]

*  why that's happening? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=990.5799999999999s)]
*  You want your kids to succeed and [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=992.4599999999999s)]

*  if you value the existence of [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WRRBGvBt4&t=1003.54s)]
