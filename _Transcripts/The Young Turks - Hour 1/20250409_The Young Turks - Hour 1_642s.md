"President Trump paused the sweeping reciprocal tariffs the U.S. imposed this week, saying dozens of countries had reached out to negotiate new trade deals.

Why it matters: It's the relief global markets, U.S. allies and many Trump advisers wanted, as fears of a global crisis mounted. But Trump didn't back off fully, keeping 10% baseline tariffs in place while increasing tariffs on China to 125%."

# BREAKING: Markets SOAR After Trump Announces Pause In Tariffs
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA)
*  Can you walk us through what you're thinking about why you decided to put a 90 day pause? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippie, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=5.92s)]
*  you know, they were getting a little bit yippie, a little bit afraid unlike these champions. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=12.16s)]
*  Because we have a big job to do. No other president would have done what I did. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=17.52s)]
*  No other president. I know the president, they wouldn't have done it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=20.96s)]
*  Yippie. You're talking about yippie. I mean, that's Donald Trump. Maybe the yippiest, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=23.36s)]
*  most complaining president of all time. But nonetheless, the yippers have gotten their way [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=31.92s)]
*  because the president announced today that he is implementing a 90 day pause on reciprocal tariffs [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=36.8s)]
*  that he had implemented against countries. And he says the only country that is an exception to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=43.68s)]
*  this 90 day pause, of course, is China. So the astronomical tariffs on Chinese goods [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=49.12s)]
*  being imported to the United States remain. And so far, the leadership in China has given [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=54.8s)]
*  us no indication that they plan to cave to the pressures coming from the Trump administration. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=60.4s)]
*  But nonetheless, all of those other astronomical, reciprocal tariffs that Trump had announced [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  during Liberation Day will be paused for 90 days. Instead, he is going to go forward with [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=71.44s)]
*  the baseline 10% tariffs on our trade partners. And he's encouraging these negotiations or [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=78.88s)]
*  renegotiations on trade deals to continue. Now, I want to be clear, anyone who thinks they know [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=86.32s)]
*  what's going to happen in the future as it pertains to these tariffs is lying to you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=92.56s)]
*  Because no one really knows what is ultimately going to happen. For me, I feel that it's pretty [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=96.8s)]
*  clear at this point that what Trump is trying to do is just renegotiate trade deals. And I think [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=104.8s)]
*  in some cases that makes a lot of sense. I actually don't think those astronomical tariffs [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=109.92s)]
*  on other trade partners are really going to be the end result of his tariff policies. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=114.4s)]
*  However, I do think he means business when it comes to China. And if you notice, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=119.44s)]
*  there was a dip in the bond market. And there's some suspicion that what led to that dip is China [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=123.76s)]
*  essentially selling off American bonds in order to bolster their economy as this trade war continues. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=130.24s)]
*  But again, when it comes to the other countries, they will now be facing a baseline 10% tariff, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=137.12s)]
*  as opposed to that baseline 10% tariff, in addition to those other astronomical tariffs [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=142.4s)]
*  that he had slapped on. Now, we don't know what the end result will be. But White House [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=148.24s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt thinks that everyone who panicked just doesn't get it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=152.96s)]
*  Many of you in the media clearly missed the art of the deal. You clearly failed to see what [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  President Trump is doing here. You tried to say that the rest of the world would be moved [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  closer to China when in fact we've seen the opposite effect. The entire world is calling [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=170.56s)]
*  the United States of America, not China, because they need our markets, they need our consumers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  And they need this president in the Oval Office to talk to them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=179.84s)]
*  You know what, Caroline Levitt is correct, okay? All you media folks who have been criticizing the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=183.04s)]
*  Trump administration, you just don't get it. Yeah, sure, sure. It is true that you had various [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump administration officials saying conflicting things at any given moment, simultaneously, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=197.6s)]
*  by the way. You've got Howard Lutnick saying, this is all about bringing jobs back to the United [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=205.28s)]
*  States, which will then be employed by robots. Then you have Scott Bessent, the Treasury [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=211.44s)]
*  Secretary, who clearly does not like these tariffs at all, telling the American people, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=217.76s)]
*  this is just an effort to renegotiate trade deals. You have Donald Trump saying anything [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=222.4s)]
*  at any given time, right? So the conflicting messages may have confused you, but let's just [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  keep it real. It's not about being confused, it's about just failing to understand the art of the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=233.68s)]
*  deal. Okay, when you get conflicting messages from the same administration, obviously that is going [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  to lead to some panic, because people are uncertain about what the future holds when it comes to these [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=244.96s)]
*  tariffs, whether Trump is actually gonna go through with the astronomical percentages that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=252.24s)]
*  he had slapped onto various trade partners. So again, we'll see what happens, but I do [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=257.04s)]
*  find it interesting how so far the administration's messaging after Trump reversed course on those [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=262.8s)]
*  tariffs, or at least implemented a pause of 90 days on those tariffs is, it's your fault. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  Media and the American people, stop your yipping. Now, the markets, by the way, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=277.44s)]
*  did react to the news the way you would expect. Dave Portnoy in a very celebratory mood today, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=282.48s)]
*  I wanna show you a screenshot of something he posted on X. I'm up $8.2 million today. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=288.4s)]
*  Where are all the people in my mentions now? It was like dancing around. Okay, but Dave, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=294.88s)]
*  don't you feel a little bit uncomfortable that the market or the stock market, I should say, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=302.56s)]
*  reacts so easily to any little piece of information that you might be up $8.2 million today, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=309.2s)]
*  but depending on what Trump says tomorrow, you could be down another $20 million. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=316.16s)]
*  That's the thing that I think people should kind of learn from this whole experience, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  For me, this bolsters why I love social security so much, even though I'm paying into it and I [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  haven't received a dime of social security yet. Because this is a universal government program [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  meant to provide fixed income to our country's elderly people and disabled people, by the way. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=340.48s)]
*  And it's not tied to the stock market. It isn't tied to these insane risks. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  And I just can't stand how the market goes up or goes down, depending on the smallest [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=353.76s)]
*  update to what the Trump administration claims they're gonna do. And we don't know if they're [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=358.64s)]
*  actually gonna go through with these processes or with these policies. But anyway, the market is up [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=362.32s)]
*  for now, and others are celebrating too. So Trump, in fact, is bragging about how he has led a record [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=368.0s)]
*  stock market recovery today as he's speaking to some of his buddies, some of his allies. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=376.64s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=382.24s)]
*  Yes, sir, Mr. Martin. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=398.24s)]
*  But you just gotta laugh. The market's up 2,500 points, nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=399.36s)]
*  And then, of course, everyone surrounding him is probably so relieved that he has [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=407.2s)]
*  decided to do this 90-day pause. He's like, yes, Mr. President, you're a genius. Yes, Mr. President, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=411.52s)]
*  you broke the stock market for some time, but then you fixed it, so you're a genius. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=415.92s)]
*  Okay, anyway, I wanna emphasize something though, because the stock market obviously [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=419.76s)]
*  is easily impacted by news, right? Anything that's happening in the news, it could be [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=427.28s)]
*  a simple announcement from the Trump administration. It could be suspicion that the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=434.0s)]
*  Trump administration isn't actually gonna go through with some of his policies. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=438.0s)]
*  Any little thing could either lead to panic or it could lead to confidence in the stock market, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=441.92s)]
*  where people start to buy shares again, invest in the stock market again. Again, it's super flimsy, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  okay? But it's not the real economy. Now, Trump's tariff policies eventually will have an impact on [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=455.52s)]
*  the real economy. And when I say real economy, what am I talking about? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, if tariffs are going to cut into the profit margins for US-based companies, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=468.32s)]
*  they're going to look to other areas for cost saving. And one of the things they might do is [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=475.2s)]
*  lay workers off. They might stop investing in their companies, just kind of hold off on [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=481.2s)]
*  spending money. And of course, that will have a ripple effect in the real economy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=486.96s)]
*  And obviously, that's going to impact American workers, at least in the short term, right? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=491.36s)]
*  So the argument that you'll hear from Trump supporters and the Trump administration is, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=496.96s)]
*  look, there might be some short term pain, but the long term idea is to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=502.32s)]
*  bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=506.24s)]
*  So theoretically, that could happen, but there's already been some indication that companies have [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  been resistant to that. And the fact that Trump keeps going back and forth, back and forth, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=516.72s)]
*  is not inspiring much confidence to bring manufacturing back to the United States, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  because no one really believes him. So look, we'll see how this all plays out. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=526.24s)]
*  We don't know what happens after those 90 days. What I can say is, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=530.72s)]
*  remember, we've got a midterm election coming up. And if he keeps doing this, pushing these [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=534.96s)]
*  tariffs back, well, then there's going to be additional pressure toward Donald Trump from [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=540.24s)]
*  Republican members of Congress to stop doing this, because it's going to hurt their chances of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=546.24s)]
*  getting reelected. To which I say, I mean, I guess have at it, Trump. If this is what you want to do, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=551.36s)]
*  have at it. But in 90 days, will he actually go through with making these insanely high tariffs [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  on our trade partners or goods produced by our trade partners that are then important to the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=562.88s)]
*  United States? Is he going to go through with the tariffs that will impact those products? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=567.76s)]
*  Who knows? But the threat of those tariffs, he believed, would bring various trade partners [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=572.56s)]
*  to the table to renegotiate deals. He claims that 70 different countries are currently renegotiating [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=578.8s)]
*  trade deals with the United States. I want to see a little more evidence before I believe that. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=583.92s)]
*  I'm not going to take it at face value. I do believe some countries have reached out to the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=588.16s)]
*  Trump administration countries like Japan, for instance, looking to renegotiate deals. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=591.92s)]

*  But do I actually think that he is going to go through with those high tariffs in 90 days? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=607.76s)]
*  Probably not. I think he's serious about tariffs against China. And I think there's good reason [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=613.68s)]
*  to be skeptical of some of our past trade deals with China and whether or not the US is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=619.36s)]
*  getting a fair deal there. So with China, I think the trade war is on. I think it'll remain. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=626.64s)]
*  But with other countries, it remains to be seen. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bo9wiAN1iA&t=632.8s)]
