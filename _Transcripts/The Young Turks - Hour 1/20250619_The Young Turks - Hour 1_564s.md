"The tax bill before Congress would partially exempt the U.S. Virgin Islands from a law meant to crack down on tax havens, after a lobbying campaign by the territory‚Äôs government and a large private credit firm that stands to benefit from the measure.
Over the past three years, an affiliate of the credit giant Golub Capital paid a Washington firm more than $500,000 to urge Congress to relax a global minimum tax approved as part of the 2017 GOP tax law, lobbying disclosures show."

# The DISGUSTING GIVEAWAY Hidden In Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A)
*  Taxpayers could be on the hook for yet another major giveaway to the ultra wealthy thanks to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=0.0s)]
*  a provision tucked away in Trump's big beautiful bill. Before we get into the specifics, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=6.72s)]
*  if you had to guess, who do you think is behind this, Cenk? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=13.6s)]
*  Now, it definitely wouldn't be a corporation that would benefit from this specific loophole, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=17.28s)]
*  and one that had given to politicians to create the loophole in the first place. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=24.16s)]
*  That I'm sure of, because then mainstream media would have warned us about that kind of corruption. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=28.24s)]
*  Yeah, no, it couldn't be. That's corruption, you can't do that. But let's find out. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=33.6s)]
*  So the measure in question would create an exemption for the US Virgin Islands in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=40.64s)]
*  pre-existing law designed to tamp down on offshore tax havens. Currently, companies that are subject [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=47.28s)]
*  to this global minimum tax are taxed at 10.5%. The measure the House passed would not substantially [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=55.28s)]
*  alter the global minimum tax or how it treats US territories broadly. Instead, it creates an exemption [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=62.72s)]
*  for certain income from, quote, services provided in the Virgin Islands, specifically for services, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=70.4s)]
*  income by a corporation based in the territory that was acquired by a, quote, closely held [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=78.64s)]
*  US corporation before December 31st, 2023. And that sounds pretty specific, but let's dig in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=84.88s)]
*  a little bit more, shall we? The provision has fueled criticism from public policy experts who [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=92.16s)]
*  say it appears designed to benefit a small number of US firms rather than to promote economic growth [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=98.16s)]
*  or some other public policy goal. The change could yield substantial benefits [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=106.56s)]
*  to a few US companies which would face a 2.1% tax on profits in the Virgin Islands rather than [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=112.16s)]
*  the current 10.5% minimum tax. So why do this? And why so specific? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=118.64s)]
*  Over the past three years, an affiliate of the credit giant, Gollum Capital, paid a Washington [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=126.88s)]
*  firm more than $500,000 to urge Congress to relax the global minimum tax. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=133.68s)]
*  Billionaire Lawrence Gollum and his brother David Gollum serve as the chief executive and president [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=142.08s)]
*  of Gollum Capital. They have given about $2 million to federal campaigns since 2020, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=147.52s)]
*  including more than $1.4 million to Republicans and conservative groups, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  according to data from the Federal Election Commission. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=158.88s)]
*  Now, proponents of this exemption say it'll help boost economic development in the Virgin Islands. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=162.24s)]
*  But this is so blatant and so narrow that conservative economic analysts say they don't [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=169.28s)]
*  buy it. Here's more. It does not make a lot of sense. I have no idea why this is in the bill, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=179.44s)]
*  says Kyle Palmer-Low, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=186.64s)]
*  think tank. What problem is it trying to solve? My guess is it's a US company or two with foreign [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  competitors that want a lower tax burden. Daniel Bunn, a policy expert at the Tax Foundation, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  a center-right think tank, agreed, telling the Washington Post, if you wanted to do an economic [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=206.56s)]
*  development policy for the Virgin Islands, you wouldn't do it this way. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=212.8s)]
*  It seems like a windfall rather than a fix to a glitch. It should be all territories or [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=217.12s)]
*  no territories. Now, Cenk, wouldn't you have it? It seems like another corporation, another special [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=223.84s)]
*  interest bought their desired legislation. Yeah, nobody could have seen that coming. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=231.52s)]
*  So first on mainstream, and I'm gonna show you the return on investment they got. First on [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=238.0s)]
*  mainstream media, to be fair, Washington Post covered this. And so we appreciate that good job [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=243.76s)]
*  by the Washington Post to do that. And where do we get our stories? We often get them from Reuters, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=248.32s)]
*  Guardian. We get them from a lot of different places, but from time to time, it'll be from [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=253.68s)]
*  text articles that Legacy Media wrote, right? But are you going to see this all over cable news? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=259.68s)]
*  No, my guess is you will never ever see it on cable news. And a lot of times what happens is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=265.52s)]
*  Washington Post or New York Times will write a good story, and then they'll never mention it again. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=271.04s)]
*  And then in the context of the next time they discuss a bill, they won't mention, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=275.92s)]
*  maybe the donors might be buying the entire bill. Well, I mean, why do you think we have [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=279.68s)]
*  the giant tax cuts in the first place? Why do you think Trump brought the corporate taxes from 35 to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  21? Because it was this story on steroids. The whole thing, all of government these days, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=289.44s)]
*  is this story on steroids. I think part of the reason they're doing this story is because it's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=296.4s)]
*  relatively, I mean, it's a big company. They have access to a lot of money, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=303.76s)]
*  But within the context of the giant companies that normally do these kind of deals and get [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=309.44s)]
*  the special loopholes, etc. They're not as large. So maybe it was, hey, we could do a one-off here, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=316.88s)]
*  as if, look at that, an exception that we found in the Virgin Islands, right? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=322.96s)]
*  No, but it's not the exception. This is how it works. And I love that their name is Gullum Capital. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=327.6s)]
*  It almost sounds like Gullum Capital. Precious, give me tax cuts. Look, they already have giant [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=331.68s)]
*  tax cuts. The reason why they're in the Virgin Islands in the first place is because they [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=339.2s)]
*  repatriate their tax at 10.8%, which is a joke. It used to be 35, now it's 21. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=342.48s)]
*  Now for this loophole, it's 10.9, but they want a new loophole that brings it down to a little over [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=348.88s)]
*  2%. So they save another 8% on top. So how much did they put in? And by the way, did they [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  just give to Republicans? Mainly Republicans, but there is a Democratic representative there [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=360.88s)]
*  in the Virgin Islands. And look at that, she's in favor of it because of jobs, right? In reality, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=365.12s)]
*  did she also get money from Gullum Capital? Yes. Did they put money into a nonprofit that she [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=371.2s)]
*  supports? Yes. Maybe that nonprofit does great work, God bless, okay? But overall, how much [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  did they put in to buy these politicians? A lot, $2.5 million in, okay? How much are they getting [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  back in this tax break? Yep, a billion dollars, a billion dollars. Now you see why, and that in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=389.2s)]
*  doesn't go to the American taxpayer, it goes to politicians, right? $2.5 million to politicians, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=398.8s)]
*  and you get back a billion dollars from the American taxpayers. Now do you see why Washington [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  is corrupt? That is what happens in every single story. You've got mainstream media reporting it [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=408.56s)]
*  in this story, but in reality, the entire budget bill and every bill of my lifetime has been that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  exact chart, right? Tiny amount of money going to the politicians, $2.5 million for them is good [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=422.48s)]
*  money. They're happy to receive those legalized bribes, and then a billion dollars of not their [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=427.92s)]
*  money, but your money going out the window. Can we bring that chart back up? I just think [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=433.68s)]
*  it's important to point out. Yes, this is totally lopsided. Also, we love Kate, our producer. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  We know she's rushed. There is no access on this. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  I just took, we love her. She puts in a ton of work, but I'm cracking up at this crap. I love it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=453.2s)]
*  This is the best. But yes, it really reflects just how cheap it is. And look at the ROI on that is [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=460.32s)]
*  crazy. All these people can be bought for so little. You spread that around the Republican party, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  you spread it around Virgin Island representative and officials there. The idea that this is somehow [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=471.76s)]
*  going to lead to economic development in the Virgin Islands is hilarious. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=478.8s)]
*  Give me a break. You could tax them locally. You could find some other way. That's really [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=483.36s)]
*  what you think. What do you think they're doing there? They're bringing the profits back home. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=488.88s)]
*  The people who work for them there are gonna get paid. What, only that workforce, only that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=493.2s)]
*  investment firm is going to spur your entire local economy? Give me a break. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  All that does is invite more tax cheats. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, just real quick on that. You know how many people the Gullum Capital employees in [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  the Virgin Islands, I mean, they're creating so much important jobs for the economy. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=514.72s)]
*  60. So a billion dollars for 60 jobs? Come on, it's a joke. And they're like, no, no, no, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=518.4s)]
*  we're planning to give an extra $100,000 to the poor in the Virgin Islands. You are. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=524.16s)]
*  With a billion dollars in proceeds, you're willing to give $100,000. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=528.4s)]
*  Will you throw in an extra nickel while you're at it? And you know what? If you're really [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=531.8399999999999s)]
*  wanted to spur investment and growth in the Virgin Islands, imagine if you took the billion dollar [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=535.92s)]
*  loophole and just gave it to the Virgin Islands. That would even create so many more jobs, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=543.2s)]
*  so much more growth. Instead, Gullum Capital is gonna get it, put it in their pocket, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=549.6s)]
*  and then they're gonna throw a couple of pennies at you while they're at it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=554.88s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. Totally not true, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=557.92s)]
*  but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyZH5nYlf3A&t=562.08s)]
