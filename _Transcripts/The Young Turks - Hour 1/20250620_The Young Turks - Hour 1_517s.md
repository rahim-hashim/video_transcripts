"President Donald Trump took direct aim at his Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Friday amid questions about how close Iran is to obtaining a nuclear weapon.
The U.S. intelligence community has stood by its opinion that Iran has a large stockpile of enriched uranium but isn‚Äôt close to building a nuclear weapon, but the president disputes that."

# Tulsi Gabbard RESPONDS After Trump Throws Her Under The Bus
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg)
*  One of the things that's made me most worried that Donald Trump is going to engage in bombing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran is his recent assertions that they are developing a nuclear weapon and could have [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=5.46s)]
*  them in weeks or months, even though that is not what our intelligence community thinks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  He reiterated that earlier today saying they could have it in weeks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=15.32s)]
*  And when he was told that our intelligence agencies, which just once again reiterated [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=18.68s)]
*  that that is not the case. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=22.78s)]
*  When he was asked about that, he said that our intelligence community is wrong. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=25.22s)]
*  And so this is feeling super run up to the war in Iraq, just again baseless belief that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=28.84s)]
*  we have to go in there because of weapons of mass destruction. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=35.08s)]
*  And one of the interesting sort of factional fights that developed from this was that to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=37.76s)]
*  assert that he had to contradict Tulsi Gabbard specifically who had testified in March that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=43.08s)]
*  they were not developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  And he seems dead set on the idea that she was wrong. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=52.04s)]
*  And that was fascinating. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=55.8s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard maybe being pushed out of the administration because she stood for the truth [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=57.0s)]
*  for once. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=62.6s)]
*  And we have a little bit of an update on that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=64.02s)]
*  But first here is Donald Trump being asked about this disagreement. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=65.28s)]
*  I think within a matter of weeks or certainly within a matter of months, they're gonna be [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=68.8s)]
*  able to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=72.92s)]
*  We can't let that happen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=74.16s)]
*  What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=75.4s)]
*  Your intelligence community has said they have no evidence that they are at this point. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=78.12s)]
*  Well, then my intelligence community is wrong. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=81.64s)]
*  Who in the intelligence community said that? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=84.12s)]
*  Your director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=86.74s)]
*  She's wrong. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  She's wrong. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  And remember, Tulsi Gabbard didn't just say that they don't have weapons. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  Like a week ago, she put out a really flashy Russian style video about World War III. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=96.46s)]
*  She seems to actually not want us to engage in actions that could lead to nuclear war. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  And so finally you have Donald Trump who seems to be willing to gobble up propaganda and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=107.3s)]
*  spread it baselessly to get us into a war. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=111.38s)]
*  And Tulsi Gabbard standing for the truth, which after the last few years is refreshing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=113.94s)]
*  And if that makes you uncomfortable, it's not actually going in that way because Tulsi [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=118.98s)]
*  Gabbard just tweeted. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=123.1s)]
*  The dishonest media is intentionally taking my testimony out of context and spreading [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=124.98s)]
*  fake news as a way to manufacture division. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=129.54s)]
*  America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=132.26s)]
*  within weeks to months if they decide to finalize the assembly. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=135.78s)]
*  President Trump has been clear that can't happen. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=139.78s)]
*  And I agree, they took it out of context. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=141.72s)]
*  She said in March, the US continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=146.52s)]
*  and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=150.92s)]
*  2003. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=154.64s)]
*  Yeah, she did more loser job. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=155.64s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=157.46s)]
*  This is utterly pathetic. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=158.46s)]
*  I'm so glad you read that second comment, John, because I was about to give her credit. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=159.5s)]
*  And I did when it first happened. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=166.0s)]
*  I was like, I thought Tulsi was going to be in favor of war against the Muslim country, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=167.66s)]
*  to be honest. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=173.33999999999997s)]
*  And so I didn't believe her that she was anti-war. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=174.64s)]
*  And so when she came out and said, no, Iran's not developing a nuclear weapon, I was like, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=177.32s)]
*  all right, we're credit is due, that's true. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=181.0s)]
*  And that's kind of an anti-war position. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=183.44s)]
*  I now take it all back. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so she's now bending an E and saying, she's totally lying, totally lying, 100% lying. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=186.88s)]
*  And by the way, it's important to note, on behalf of Israel, not on behalf of us, we [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=196.28s)]
*  got nothing to do with that war, nothing to do with that war. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=201.6s)]
*  So now let me go to Ted Cruz real quick. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=205.1s)]
*  So he was with Tucker Carlson, you guys know, yeah, Carlson humiliated him as Trey was referring [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=206.58s)]
*  to there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=211.16s)]
*  And when Tucker asked him, hey, what's so great about Israel? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=212.46s)]
*  I mean, that's a very rough paraphrase, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=217.24s)]
*  Ted Cruz was like, they're our greatest ally. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  Okay, yeah, but other than them giving you, did AIPAC giving you millions of dollars, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=225.64s)]
*  why are they our greatest ally? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=229.2s)]
*  He said, because they share intelligence with us. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, false intelligence in order to push us into a war, which was where we got the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=233.92s)]
*  fake intelligence about the WMD in Iraq. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=239.88s)]
*  And now we have fake intelligence about Iran to push us into a war with Iran. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  With allies like that, you don't need enemies, they just create enemies for you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  They create giant wars for you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=250.66s)]
*  And then what's the second reason he gave? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=252.64s)]
*  He said, the people that hate them also hate us. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=255.0s)]
*  Hmm, I wonder why. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=259.04s)]
*  Did it ever occur to you that the people who hate them hate us? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=262.04s)]
*  Because we back all of their wars against those people, and that we fund Israel and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=265.34s)]
*  their war crimes and their aggressive attacks against those countries? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=271.44s)]
*  Gee, did that ever occur to you, Ted? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=275.92s)]
*  So they're all enormously corrupt. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=278.28s)]
*  If you're trying to figure out who's better, Ted Cruz or Tucker Carlson on this, that is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=280.64s)]
*  not a close question. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=284.84s)]
*  You could say blind squirrel, you could say anything you want about Tucker Carlson. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=286.84s)]
*  There's a lot of terrible things to say about Tucker Carlson. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=289.64s)]
*  But on this, Ted Cruz is 100% corrupt and totally and utterly works for Israel. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=292.61999999999995s)]
*  And just the fact that Tucker Carlson doesn't work for Israel is shocking in Washington [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=298.94s)]
*  that anyone that has any degree of power and is on the right wing doesn't work for Israel. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=303.76s)]
*  So super last thing is, you really wanna unite, and you guys do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=309.14s)]
*  Bill Lowry just became a member, hit the join button below on YouTube, we appreciate [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=313.36s)]
*  you, Phil. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=316.6s)]
*  Then wrote in, this is at least an opportunity to form groups and plan protests and whatever [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=317.6s)]
*  else we can do to show our disgust with the thought of entering a foreign war unprovoked. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  Look, we started unitedagainstwar.com. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  Dave Smith, who's a prominent libertarian, came on the show a couple of days ago and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  says, I'll unite against war. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=333.24s)]
*  Yes, the libertarians are against it, progressives are against it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=334.88s)]
*  What would be amazing is if MAGA actually lived up to what they were gonna say. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump is asking you, if you're MAGA, to put pressure on him so he could decide who's stronger, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  MAGA or the neocons. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=349.52s)]
*  So MAGA, are you just gonna let the neocons win? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=351.18s)]
*  Or you're just gonna surrender to them? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=354.28s)]
*  Or are you gonna go out there? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=356.64s)]
*  I mean, imagine seeing a right wing protest of a war. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=357.76s)]
*  I'm not sure I've ever seen that in my entire life. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  Now I'm gonna ask you to imagine something that is, you're gonna have incredible difficulty [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=365.32s)]
*  imagining. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  Imagine a right wing and left wing protest together of a war. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=370.64000000000004s)]
*  Okay, I think that's what we should do on 4th of July. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=375.32000000000005s)]
*  Okay, but I don't know that I can get anyone else to join that protest. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  It might be just me out there, right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=382.8s)]
*  Because the left will say, no, I hate the right so much. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  I'll never have a beer with them, even if we're gonna ally against the war. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=388.52000000000004s)]
*  The right will say they hate the left and we'll all hate each other. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  And then Israel will win and we'll attack Iran and get into another giant war. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=394.88s)]
*  I'm trying unitedeswar.com, Trey, last word. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=399.76s)]
*  Yeah, well on that note, like John said earlier, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=403.67999999999995s)]
*  starting to feel very run up to the war in Iraq 20 years ago or whatever. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=406.08s)]
*  But just pretty much baldly lying about them having weapons of mass destruction and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=409.88s)]
*  everything. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  And of course that was never true, but in how back then there was no resistance to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=416.2s)]
*  it at all. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  And I feel like that is an important piece of context that makes it a little more, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if interesting is the right word this time around. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=423.08s)]
*  But obviously you guys know and remember in 2003, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=425.08s)]
*  it was a very bloodlusty time in America. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=428.32s)]
*  Peace was out, it was not a big time for being pro peace in 2003. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  And I know there was some opposition to it, but [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=436.52s)]
*  everybody on the right was 100% united. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  Cuz we wanted vengeance and they had nothing to do with it, it didn't matter. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  But none of that is happening right here in this scenario. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  And like you said earlier, more than half of MAGA is against this. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=447.2s)]
*  And I think you're right, I think there's polling that indicates that too. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=450.4s)]
*  I think most Americans do not want this to happen. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=454.4s)]
*  And I don't, I'm a dad in the wool lefty, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=458.12s)]
*  I don't really get what the problem is even supposed to be with [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=461.35999999999996s)]
*  agreeing with the other side on especially something like, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=466.24s)]
*  we're talking about war, maybe World War III. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=471.0s)]
*  You can't come together on something like that just because of whatever, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=474.68s)]
*  political affiliation or just not feeling comfortable with it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=478.84s)]
*  I don't get that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=482.68s)]
*  I think anyone who's got any sense should speak out against this particular [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  situation and politics aside and if we, the people who agree on that, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=488.68s)]
*  you're allowed to agree and that's okay. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=493.32s)]
*  It's war, it's bad, like, let's go. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=495.40000000000003s)]
*  And the right wing would be joining us in an anti war protest. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  We're kind of known for anti war protests. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=502.12s)]
*  Right. It's not like we didn't invent it, right? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=504.24s)]
*  Right. So unitedagainstwar.com, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=506.64s)]
*  we'll have the link in the description box. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=508.64s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbVmP1zreg&t=513.6s)]
