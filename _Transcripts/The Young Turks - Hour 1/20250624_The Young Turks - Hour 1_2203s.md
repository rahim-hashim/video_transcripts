"Whatever prevented the Washington media from telling the full story of Joe Biden‚Äôs declining health, that spell has been broken. Indeed, the same people who turned a blind eye to the president‚Äôs mental state are now buzzing about Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson‚Äôs forthcoming book, Original Sin, which promises an ‚Äúunflinching and explosive‚Äù accounting of Biden‚Äôs reelection campaign ‚Äúdespite evidence of his serious decline‚Äîamid desperate efforts to hide the extent of that deterioration.‚Äù

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.
TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.
TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# Was An Intelligence Agency Behind The Epstein Scheme?
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc)
*  Tara Palmieri joins me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=0.0s)]
*  She's an independent journalist, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1.32s)]
*  author of The Red Letter on [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=3.08s)]
*  Substack, host of The Tara Palmieri [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=4.48s)]
*  Show, but she was also at ABC News, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=6.44s)]
*  Politico, CNN, Puck, New York Post, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=8.42s)]
*  Washington Examiner, you name it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=10.72s)]
*  She was a White House reporter [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=13.08s)]
*  covering the Trump administration [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  in the first term for Politico. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=17.38s)]
*  And Sean Spicer said, quote, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=19.32s)]
*  she's an idiot with no real sources, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=21.34s)]
*  which is hilarious. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=23.76s)]
*  Tara, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=25.04s)]
*  And I'll ask you right away, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=28.52s)]
*  what do you say to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=30.28s)]
*  Sean Spicer back? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=31.419999999999998s)]
*  I just say consider the source. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=33.64s)]
*  He's suing you or something? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=35.36s)]
*  He threatened to, but yeah, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=38.8s)]
*  that went away pretty quickly. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=41.24s)]
*  I don't think it would hold up in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=44.56s)]
*  court, and also, again, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  consider the source, Sean Spicer. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=48.64s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  We actually had him on the show [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=55.4s)]
*  recently, we should get you guys [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=56.64s)]
*  together, or maybe we shouldn't. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=57.8s)]
*  I don't know about that one. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=59.04s)]
*  I don't know why I got under his [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=61.08s)]
*  skin, I gotta say, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=63.28s)]
*  it was really strange to me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  He really just didn't like me very [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=67.72s)]
*  much, and I felt like I was pretty [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=69.96s)]
*  fair, but- [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=72.36s)]
*  Yeah, so Tara, that's actually [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=73.6s)]
*  part of what I want to start with. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=75.28s)]
*  You also covered the FC files, and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=77.12s)]
*  I want to get to that too, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=78.4s)]
*  that's super interesting. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=79.24s)]
*  But so we had on here, Sam [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=80.6s)]
*  Donaldson, probably nearly 20 years [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=84.36s)]
*  ago on the Young Turks. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  And he told a great story about [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=88.96s)]
*  Ruin Arledge, legendary head of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=90.6s)]
*  ABC News for a long time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  That when Sam Donaldson was [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=95.28s)]
*  the White House reporter for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=96.8s)]
*  ABC at the time, whenever Reagan [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  called to complain about Donaldson, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=100.88s)]
*  Ruin Arledge would give him a raise. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=103.28s)]
*  And then later- [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's the way it should be. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=106.96s)]
*  Yeah, and later when he covered [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  the Clinton administration, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=110.16s)]
*  Ruin Arledge did the same exact [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  thing. So it didn't matter if it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=113.52s)]
*  was a Republican or a Democrat. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=114.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  But if the administration complained [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=116.28s)]
*  about it, you got a raise. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=117.52s)]
*  So I'm a little afraid that we've [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=118.28s)]
*  lost those days. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  But you've covered it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=121.44s)]
*  You've been in a lot of our [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=122.8s)]
*  mainstream media organizations or [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=124.08s)]
*  legacy media or [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=125.72s)]
*  whatever we want to call them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=126.44s)]
*  So what's your sense of it? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=127.88s)]
*  Are we still as aggressive against [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=129.48s)]
*  both parties and the powerful or [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=132.0s)]
*  not as much? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=134.12s)]
*  It's hard because there are these [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=136.32s)]
*  very insider organizations now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=139.4s)]
*  There's so many of them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=141.88s)]
*  It's so fragmented. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=143.16s)]
*  And they really are selling on [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=145.08s)]
*  access, right? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=147.28s)]
*  There's just so [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=148.96s)]
*  many news organizations from [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=150.24s)]
*  Politico to Punchbowl to Axios. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=152.4s)]
*  Everybody is just trying to get [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=155.24s)]
*  that last scrap, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=157.0s)]
*  that last little scoop, right? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=157.96s)]
*  And everybody wants access. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=159.84s)]
*  And President Trump is obviously [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=162.36s)]
*  not only threatening to cut off [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=164.4s)]
*  access, but he's also threatening [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=166.24s)]
*  to sue on top of all that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=168.32s)]
*  And it is suing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=169.96s)]
*  Look what happened with CBS having [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=170.8s)]
*  to deal with this whole thing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=173.24s)]
*  And so it's putting these major [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=174.6s)]
*  news organizations in a position [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=176.44s)]
*  that is not choosing news, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  They're choosing their business [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  over the news actual investigative [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=183.32s)]
*  journalism and bringing information [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=186.36s)]
*  to the public, I think. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=189.44s)]
*  And that's not to say that everyone [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=192.08s)]
*  is corrupt and you can't believe [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  anything that you read in the news. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  I do think there are a lot of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=197.8s)]
*  really well-meaning journalists. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=199.0s)]
*  But I think sometimes when the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=200.4s)]
*  story gets all the way to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=201.92s)]
*  management, they can slow roll it [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=203.0s)]
*  if they know it's going to be [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=204.4s)]
*  a problem. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=205.6s)]
*  They look at you like you are [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=206.24s)]
*  a problem when you bring in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=207.84s)]
*  the hard stories. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=209.2s)]
*  It would be a lot easier for [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=210.4s)]
*  them if you didn't. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=211.64s)]
*  And so you really have to find some [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=213.0s)]
*  bosses that really believe in you [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=214.76s)]
*  that want to make trouble. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, a good journalist makes [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=218.16s)]
*  trouble. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes, yes, couldn't agree more. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=220.64s)]
*  All right, so let's break that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=222.92s)]
*  down because you said a lot of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=224.0s)]
*  interesting things there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=224.88s)]
*  So people often talk about access, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=226.12s)]
*  but I think the folks at home, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  they don't know why the media or [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=229.84s)]
*  organizations are obsessed with [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=231.8s)]
*  access. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=233.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=233.96s)]
*  What is it about access that's so [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=235.08s)]
*  important to these media [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=236.68s)]
*  organizations? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  I personally don't understand why [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  they're so obsessed with access to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=241.08s)]
*  President Trump when he tweets [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  everything out. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=244.0s)]
*  There is no mystery. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  There is no, he answers the phone [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=245.68s)]
*  for anyone. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  I called him two weeks ago, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=249.56s)]
*  he answered the phone and we spoke. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he's literally the most [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=252.08s)]
*  successful person of all time. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=253.8s)]
*  So this idea of trying to get in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  with the administration is silly. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=257.24s)]
*  Plus, I don't think he really [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=259.16s)]
*  likes journalists too that are [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=260.56s)]
*  playing just for access to him. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=262.64s)]
*  He wants to be loved, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=266.52s)]
*  that's part of the Trump psychology, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=267.88s)]
*  right? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=270.24s)]
*  Trying to win daddy back, and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=270.96s)]
*  that includes with journalists. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  Why do you think Maggie Haberman [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=273.79999999999995s)]
*  has been one of the most successful [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=275.35999999999996s)]
*  journalists at the New York Times? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=277.12s)]
*  President Trump can't win her over. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=279.28s)]
*  And their relationship goes way [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=281.12s)]
*  back, actually, Maggie and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=282.88s)]
*  I used to work in the same newsroom [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=284.41999999999996s)]
*  at the New York Post. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=286.08s)]
*  And that's when I met Donald Trump, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  when I was 22 years old and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=288.88s)]
*  he used to call me all the time and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=290.04s)]
*  ask me to write about him running [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=291.48s)]
*  for president. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  And I literally had to say, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  Mr. Trump, we can't write about you [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  anymore running for president, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  because you're not. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  And so that's all to say is this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  president, his drug is media. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  That is his heroin. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=304.68s)]
*  He loves to talk to journalists, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  that's why he picks up [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=307.48s)]
*  the phone at midnight. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=308.36s)]
*  First of all, Tara, he called you [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  when you were 22, all the time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=312.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=315.0s)]
*  I was working at page six, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  I was working at page six, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  which is in the New York to him [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=319.72s)]
*  being in the tabloids and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  the gossip column, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  and there was nothing higher. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  And sure, I was the 22 year old [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=325.16s)]
*  working at page six. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes, okay. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  And both of those things are things [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=329.24s)]
*  he's very attracted to. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=330.68s)]
*  Anyways, but you're right, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=332.12s)]
*  the page six stuff with Trump is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=333.92s)]
*  hilarious when he would pretend to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  be John Barron and call in about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  how he was dating Madonna and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  stuff. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=340.56s)]
*  Doesn't get any funnier than that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=341.48s)]
*  He stopped pretending with me. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  I think he was at his political [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  stage at that point and thought, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=345.68s)]
*  write this down. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm about to be the president of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=348.44s)]
*  the United States. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=349.52s)]
*  It was not, it was less about his [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=350.12s)]
*  love life. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=351.52s)]
*  He was married to Melania. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=352.16s)]
*  I guess his playboy days were [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=353.76s)]
*  allegedly behind him, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=355.48s)]
*  not so much as we saw, but. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=356.56s)]
*  But it was a bit of a different [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=358.0s)]
*  agenda. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=360.68s)]
*  But okay, so for Trump, you don't [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=361.44s)]
*  need that much access and [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=363.44s)]
*  he's going to give it to you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=365.0s)]
*  anyway. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=366.56s)]
*  But is it because the editors, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=367.12s)]
*  the publishers think overall in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=369.28s)]
*  politics, breaking a story is so [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=371.44s)]
*  important to their business model, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=374.0s)]
*  and the only way to break stories [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=377.24s)]
*  is if you have access to the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=379.4s)]
*  politicians with those stories. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=381.2s)]
*  Is that why they're catering to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=383.4s)]
*  them more? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=385.24s)]
*  I think so. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=385.84s)]
*  I also think with President Trump, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=388.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it just gets so [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  much more complicated too. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=391.44s)]
*  I think you saw what happened with [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=393.2s)]
*  Politico where they cut the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=395.24s)]
*  subscriptions that the government [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=397.08s)]
*  agencies had to the Politico Pro. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=399.2s)]
*  That's a huge part of their [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=401.44s)]
*  business model. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=403.08s)]
*  He can be vindictive. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  The Associated Press out of the pool [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=405.32s)]
*  and the Associated Press, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=407.47999999999996s)]
*  their business model relies on them [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=409.11999999999995s)]
*  putting out wires, being present, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  physically present at events. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=413.67999999999995s)]
*  And if they're not able to be there [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=415.67999999999995s)]
*  to cover them, that puts them at [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  a huge disadvantage when they're [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=419.11999999999995s)]
*  competing against Reuters. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  And so I just think he really knows [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  how to play with the business [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=424.08s)]
*  interests of the press. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=425.4s)]
*  And I've always believed though, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=426.64s)]
*  access journalism is not [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=428.76s)]
*  the best journalism. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=430.32s)]
*  Even when Spicer and I, I'm not [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  even going to go into it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=434.04s)]
*  But even when I was reporting [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  mostly from the outside of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=436.8s)]
*  the White House, I still felt that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=438.42s)]
*  I was still breaking stories because [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  I had more time to pick up the phone [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=443.04s)]
*  or to go out and meet with people [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  who don't want to be seen talking [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=447.44000000000005s)]
*  to me, right? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=449.68s)]
*  I mean, those are the best sources [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=450.92s)]
*  and those are the best stories. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=453.12s)]
*  I mean, it's the real shoe leather [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  journalism. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=457.0s)]

*  the big stories, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=469.4s)]
*  they're behind the scenes hitting [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=470.24s)]
*  the phones and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=472.06s)]
*  trying to get the scoop. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=472.76s)]
*  And I think what you see in a lot [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=474.08s)]
*  of the briefing room is jousting. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=476.08s)]
*  It's important, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  it's important jousting. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=479.4s)]
*  We need that for public debate and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=480.56s)]
*  we need to hold people in power to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=482.28s)]
*  account. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=483.96s)]
*  I would never say it's not [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=484.8s)]
*  important, but there's a place for [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=486.0s)]
*  all of it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think we all just need to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=489.0s)]
*  understand where we sit into this [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  ecosystem and make sure that the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=492.44s)]
*  business interests don't become [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=494.24s)]
*  more important than the public [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=496.28s)]
*  interest, which is public service, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=498.16s)]
*  which is delivering information. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=500.32s)]
*  But yeah, access is journalism has [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=502.44s)]
*  always been a problem. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=504.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=507.4s)]
*  So you mentioned they might slow [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=508.24s)]
*  roll some hard stories. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=510.04s)]
*  So in this era, it's easy to kind [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=511.92s)]
*  of figure out what a hard story [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=513.6s)]
*  might be something critical of [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=515.12s)]
*  Trump, right? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=516.52s)]
*  But can you give us outside of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=517.24s)]
*  Trump, minus Trump, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=519.44s)]
*  examples of what might be hard [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=521.8s)]
*  stories where they go, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=523.76s)]
*  this is going to cause some issues [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=525.44s)]
*  for us? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  It's hard to say because I haven't [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=529.52s)]
*  worked in a newsroom in a while. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=531.96s)]
*  I mean, I remember when I worked [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=534.32s)]
*  at Politico, for example, and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=537.28s)]
*  I was covering Joe Biden, and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=540.12s)]
*  I broke the story about Hunter [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=542.52s)]
*  Biden and the gun and really the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=544.64s)]
*  thing that got him indicted. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=546.8s)]
*  That took a very long time to get [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=549.12s)]
*  published. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=550.84s)]
*  I got the feeling that it was [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=551.44s)]
*  being slow rolled. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=552.44s)]
*  It was at the beginning of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=553.24s)]
*  the administration. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=554.12s)]
*  A lot of my colleagues didn't like [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  it. I mean, newsrooms are political [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=556.9200000000001s)]
*  on both sides. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=558.84s)]
*  And I've never been one to pick [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  a side based on the politics or [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=562.24s)]
*  who's in power, who's not. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=564.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't like group think, and [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=566.24s)]
*  I tend to gravitate towards [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=568.48s)]
*  the stories that are outside of [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=570.64s)]
*  the group think or maybe others are [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=573.2s)]
*  a little afraid to touch. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=576.2s)]
*  But I've seen it on both sides. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=579.0s)]
*  Now I was only at puck for, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=581.8399999999999s)]
*  I think like a month or two into [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=583.5999999999999s)]
*  this Trump administration, but [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=585.5999999999999s)]
*  I never felt that they tried to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=587.9599999999999s)]
*  stop me from reporting anything [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=590.2399999999999s)]
*  really. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=592.5999999999999s)]
*  I was pretty tough on the Trump [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=594.0s)]
*  campaign, although I was honest. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=595.88s)]
*  I was one of the few reporters that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=598.4s)]
*  was saying they're winning. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  People hated that. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=601.56s)]
*  And people hated when he [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=603.2399999999999s)]
*  reported that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=604.68s)]
*  But it was true. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=606.1199999999999s)]
*  I was like, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=607.48s)]
*  this is what's happening. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=608.08s)]
*  And even on Reddit, people are [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=610.32s)]
*  like, what's wrong with this woman? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=612.12s)]
*  We hate her. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=614.36s)]
*  And then guys, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  it's an inconvenient truth. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=616.0400000000001s)]
*  But the Trump team also hated me [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  because I was talking about how [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=620.32s)]
*  they were making money and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=621.96s)]
*  the drama behind the scenes and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=623.44s)]
*  the concerns and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=625.2800000000001s)]
*  the messy ground game. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=626.32s)]
*  I mean, I think we're poor and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=628.24s)]
*  then let the pieces fall where [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=630.24s)]
*  they could fall, right? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=632.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=634.1600000000001s)]
*  you kind of sound like a reporter. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=635.0s)]
*  Where you're supposed to accurately [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=637.24s)]
*  report. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=638.6s)]
*  These are the problems that they're [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=639.28s)]
*  having, but they are winning and [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=640.96s)]
*  they were winning. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=642.44s)]
*  Yeah, they did win. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=643.56s)]
*  Believe me, I know. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=644.8s)]
*  We took tremendous heat for [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=645.6s)]
*  saying he's winning. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=647.72s)]
*  The polling is clear, certainly in [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=649.6s)]
*  the beginning, in the middle, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=651.72s)]
*  certainly when Biden was in the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=653.68s)]
*  race, it wasn't even close, right? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=655.48s)]
*  But people often don't want to [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=658.0s)]
*  hear the truth. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=659.48s)]
*  Okay, one more thing about legacy [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=660.4s)]
*  media before we move to the files. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=662.28s)]
*  So, from my taste, they don't cover [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=664.88s)]
*  money in politics almost at all, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=669.08s)]
*  right? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=672.88s)]
*  And I don't get it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=673.76s)]
*  I mean, I think I do, but [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=675.92s)]
*  from a news perspective, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=677.52s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=679.28s)]
*  Because 95% of the time, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=680.56s)]
*  the person with more money wins [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=681.96s)]
*  the race. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=683.52s)]
*  And I wouldn't report that like, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=684.4s)]
*  it's a wonderful thing. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=685.8s)]
*  This person is leading the race [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=686.76s)]
*  because they've raised more money. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=688.12s)]
*  I would wonder, well, yeah, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=689.96s)]
*  then who do they owe, right? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=691.2s)]
*  But that part of the story never, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=692.44s)]
*  ever, ever gets told. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=694.2s)]
*  And then in the legislation, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=695.6800000000001s)]
*  my God, the lobbyists have massive, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=697.7600000000001s)]
*  massive influence. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=699.96s)]
*  And they pretty much tell [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=701.72s)]
*  the politicians what to do. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=702.84s)]
*  But whenever I read legacy media, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=704.0400000000001s)]
*  that's not the story I see. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=706.36s)]
*  The story I see is about how [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=708.44s)]
*  they're having a debate about [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=709.96s)]
*  policy or ideology. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=711.8800000000001s)]
*  So what do you make of that? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=713.72s)]
*  Why do you think that that is not [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=715.5200000000001s)]
*  as emphasized in legacy media? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=717.2s)]
*  Okay, so the sources to the stories, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  a lot of them, are the consultants [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=722.0s)]
*  around these politicians, right? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=724.56s)]
*  The lobbyists, for example. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=727.16s)]
*  And if you start writing about [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=728.96s)]
*  their money, you will be cut off. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=731.4s)]
*  That's who really cuts you off. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=734.84s)]
*  That's who really takes away [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=736.92s)]
*  your access. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=738.36s)]
*  Those are the people who really [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=739.08s)]
*  make it difficult for you. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=740.76s)]
*  If you mention they have [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=742.48s)]
*  pass-through accounts that are [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=743.84s)]
*  making millions of dollars are [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=745.6s)]
*  super PAC. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=747.52s)]
*  Or you talk about who's donating to [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=749.04s)]
*  their PACs or this or that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=751.2s)]
*  I mean, Ken Vogel at the New York [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=753.24s)]
*  Times is a great reporter. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=755.44s)]
*  He's really on this. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=757.16s)]
*  He really has covered money and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=758.96s)]
*  influence in politics for [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=760.76s)]
*  a really long time. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=762.32s)]
*  But a lot of journalists, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=763.84s)]
*  especially beat reporters, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=765.32s)]
*  they fall into the trap of not [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=767.16s)]
*  wanting to cover their sources. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=768.84s)]
*  Because their sources benefit from [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=771.52s)]
*  this kind of big money, PAC money. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=774.2s)]
*  From lobbying money, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  they benefit from all that. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=779.08s)]
*  It's the swamp. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=780.72s)]
*  The swamp feeds itself and [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=781.8000000000001s)]
*  the journalists are part of it too. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=783.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great answer. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=785.2s)]
*  There's a couple of things in there [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=787.28s)]
*  that I hadn't considered. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=789.16s)]
*  Since I'm not in that world, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=791.0s)]
*  the power of the consultants is [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=792.6s)]
*  something I read about but [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=794.2s)]
*  didn't experience in the way that [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=795.48s)]
*  you describe. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=797.28s)]
*  It's like a mafia. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=798.08s)]
*  It really is. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=799.6s)]
*  No, it's not a mafia. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=800.84s)]
*  People don't die because of it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=801.76s)]
*  But their careers can be ended in [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=802.9200000000001s)]
*  a lot of ways, right? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  I think there's a real power of [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=806.28s)]
*  the consultancy class. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=808.36s)]
*  But they're also blamed. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=810.4399999999999s)]
*  They're always the first to be [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=811.9599999999999s)]
*  blamed too when a candidate loses. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=813.6s)]
*  I mean, there's a circular firing [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=815.3199999999999s)]
*  squad happening right now within [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=817.24s)]
*  the Biden world and the Harris world. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=819.0s)]
*  How can you spend over a billion [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=821.56s)]
*  dollars and still lose, right? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=823.16s)]
*  Who made money? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=824.76s)]
*  Which PAC made all this money? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=826.0799999999999s)]
*  Who cleaned up at the end? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=827.68s)]
*  There's a lot of anger at that [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  super PAC. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=830.88s)]
*  I'm blanking on the name of it [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=832.24s)]
*  right now, but- [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=833.3199999999999s)]
*  It was run by Biden's, yes, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=834.0400000000001s)]
*  Future Forward. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=835.72s)]
*  It was run by Biden's former [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=836.84s)]
*  communications director, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=838.52s)]
*  Anita Dunn. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=840.2s)]
*  Where did all that money go? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=841.24s)]
*  That's what everyone always says, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=842.84s)]
*  right? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=844.52s)]
*  But you know that someone walked [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=845.0400000000001s)]
*  away a lot richer. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=846.64s)]
*  And the candidate loses and [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  that makes people angry. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=849.24s)]
*  Because you can walk away rich as [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=850.64s)]
*  long as your candidate wins. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=852.52s)]
*  Because once you're in power, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=854.36s)]
*  then everyone gets wealthy through [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=855.76s)]
*  the influence game, access to power, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=857.44s)]
*  again. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=859.2800000000001s)]
*  That's so sick. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=859.7800000000001s)]
*  It's all about getting that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=861.32s)]
*  money back. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=863.28s)]
*  It's all about that access game. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=864.08s)]
*  And it works for [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=866.04s)]
*  the journalists too. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=866.72s)]
*  I mean, that's part of the reason [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=867.92s)]
*  why I don't live in Washington. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=869.52s)]
*  I just think that there's something [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=870.84s)]
*  about it, it rubs off on you. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=872.4s)]
*  I go there frequently, but for [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=874.08s)]
*  work to do reporting, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=875.88s)]
*  to meet with sources. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=877.16s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=878.5600000000001s)]
*  I think you got to get out of there, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=879.8s)]
*  take a shower and rearrange your [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=881.5600000000001s)]
*  look and realize this is not [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=883.36s)]
*  normal. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=884.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, no, that is a [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=885.48s)]
*  really interesting way of framing [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=888.28s)]
*  it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=891.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=892.52s)]
*  I think there was, and [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=893.4399999999999s)]
*  if you notice by the way, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=894.64s)]
*  for those of you at home, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=895.92s)]
*  how many stories have been written [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=897.4s)]
*  where they named the consultants [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  that kept a lot of money and [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  got super rich off this campaign, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=903.0799999999999s)]
*  even though Kamala Harris lost? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=905.24s)]
*  I haven't seen any. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=907.36s)]
*  I don't know if there's been one or [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=908.8s)]
*  two, but I've seen zero. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=910.36s)]
*  It's rare. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=911.6s)]
*  It's rare, you just see it from [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=912.56s)]
*  time to time. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=914.24s)]
*  My former colleague Teddy Schleifer [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=915.0799999999999s)]
*  at the New York Times, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=917.3199999999999s)]
*  he's written about it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=918.64s)]
*  I've written about it as well, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=920.16s)]
*  particularly after the campaign [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=922.12s)]
*  when people realized that Kamala [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=923.88s)]
*  Harris was in debt after all of [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=925.46s)]
*  that. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=926.92s)]
*  I mean, people were furious. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  I got tons of phone calls. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=929.48s)]
*  But yeah, a lot of people are, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=931.88s)]
*  they're not really willing to sell [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=933.52s)]
*  out their sources. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=935.3s)]
*  And believe me, if someone's a [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=936.52s)]
*  former communications director and [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=937.84s)]
*  they're working a super bag, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=939.4s)]
*  they know how to work journalists [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=940.68s)]
*  to make sure their names are not [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=942.12s)]
*  in the story. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=943.28s)]
*  So- [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=943.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's another huge part of [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=944.36s)]
*  it. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=946.08s)]
*  Once you're a source, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=946.58s)]
*  you get more protected. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=947.44s)]
*  Okay, so now let's, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=948.68s)]
*  speaking of protected and [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=950.0s)]
*  let's go to Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=951.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  So you've covered this for [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=955.0s)]
*  a while. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=956.62s)]
*  So first fun question, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=957.2399999999999s)]
*  what do you think? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=958.8399999999999s)]
*  Are the files, A, relevant when we [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=960.4s)]
*  finally see them? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=962.7199999999999s)]
*  Is there something real in [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=964.1999999999999s)]
*  the files? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=965.64s)]
*  And of course, you're guessing it's [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=966.9599999999999s)]
*  your estimation based on covering [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=968.5999999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=970.2399999999999s)]
*  And B, are we ever going to see [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=970.7399999999999s)]
*  the files? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=972.12s)]
*  Okay, so there's no John Doe list. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=974.4s)]
*  I'm so tired of hearing people say [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=978.4399999999999s)]
*  the list, okay? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=980.28s)]
*  There is no list. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=981.4s)]
*  Everybody needs to get over that, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=983.52s)]
*  there is no list. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=984.8s)]
*  Now, I've gone through almost all [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=985.76s)]
*  the public files. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=987.64s)]
*  And those are the files that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=989.12s)]
*  Pam Bondi put out. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=990.4399999999999s)]
*  There was nothing new. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=991.4s)]
*  It was a complete joke when she did [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=992.4s)]
*  that and she used these right [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=994.28s)]
*  leaning influencers as props in [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=995.92s)]
*  front of the White House with [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=997.72s)]
*  her classified binder. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  Nothing in there was classified. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1000.56s)]
*  It was Virginia, Juffre Roberts, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1002.0s)]
*  all of those were court documents [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1004.1999999999999s)]
*  basically. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1006.1999999999999s)]
*  She's a very good friend of mine. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1007.36s)]
*  I worked on the podcast with her, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1009.0s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1010.92s)]
*  Definitely check it out. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1012.4799999999999s)]
*  We traveled all over and [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1013.3199999999999s)]
*  we found witnesses to corroborate [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1014.52s)]
*  her case and the case of so [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1016.1999999999999s)]
*  many others. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1017.52s)]
*  And they ended up using it actually [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1018.12s)]
*  to prosecute Glaine Maxwell. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1020.4799999999999s)]
*  The only person by the way who is [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1022.92s)]
*  behind bars right now despite [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1024.76s)]
*  the fact that this is the largest [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1026.6s)]
*  sex trafficking operation maybe in [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  our modern time right now. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1031.0s)]
*  It's unclear at least in America. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1033.04s)]
*  But the point is that no one has [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  paid the price for this. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1036.72s)]
*  And there's absolutely, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1039.24s)]
*  absolutely evidence that hasn't [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1041.0800000000002s)]
*  been released. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1043.8400000000001s)]
*  There's photographs, I'm sure. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1045.56s)]
*  There are videos. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1048.04s)]
*  The girls told me that they [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1049.28s)]
*  basically filmed everything. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1050.68s)]
*  There were videos of everything. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1053.32s)]
*  They were constantly collecting [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1054.4s)]
*  compromise. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1055.88s)]
*  So I'm sure the FBI has that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1056.8s)]
*  Problem is there are minors, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1059.16s)]
*  involved in this. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1061.0s)]
*  And so I could see why they don't [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1062.3600000000001s)]
*  want to make that footage, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1064.68s)]
*  that data public. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1066.84s)]
*  Because there are a lot of [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1069.2s)]
*  women's names. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1070.96s)]
*  There are the names of children, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  now women. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1074.52s)]
*  There are graphic photos. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1076.28s)]
*  I remember Virginia telling me [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1078.1599999999999s)]
*  that she was brought into the FBI. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1080.24s)]
*  And they saw a picture of her being [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1082.24s)]
*  raped by a very prominent person. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1085.0s)]
*  I don't want to mention it right [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1089.96s)]
*  now because I feel uncomfortable [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1091.3999999999999s)]
*  speaking about her and [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1092.8799999999999s)]
*  her experience and her death. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1093.84s)]
*  Something that she didn't talk [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1095.32s)]
*  about publicly. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1096.6s)]
*  But yeah, they have photographic [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1097.6s)]
*  evidence. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  That's probably what they're [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1101.8799999999999s)]
*  withholding, and the videos, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1104.1999999999998s)]
*  that footage. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1106.7199999999998s)]
*  They could certainly try to [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1108.28s)]
*  prosecute these people. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1109.48s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple things about [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1111.28s)]
*  that. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1112.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know what's stopping them. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1113.28s)]
*  I mean, the names that I've heard, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  I can understand why they're not [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1116.6799999999998s)]
*  prosecuting them. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1118.28s)]
*  They're very powerful people. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1119.12s)]
*  Yeah, so well, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1121.12s)]
*  a word you use might explain it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  You use the word compromise. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1125.24s)]
*  And that's having compromising [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1127.16s)]
*  information about a public [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1129.16s)]
*  official that you could then use, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1131.0s)]
*  presumably to blackmail them and [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1133.2s)]
*  influence them. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1135.24s)]
*  And so who was collecting this as [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1136.24s)]
*  compromise? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1139.24s)]
*  Epstein was, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1141.88s)]
*  he was absolutely collecting it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1142.64s)]
*  Just Epstein or do we think there [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1144.4s)]
*  was someone behind Epstein? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1146.52s)]
*  You think Massad? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1150.4s)]
*  Is that what you're thinking? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1151.8400000000001s)]
*  I know that he was helping the CIA. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1152.8s)]
*  I remember seeing that in some of [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1156.9199999999998s)]
*  the data, in some of the documents [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1158.8s)]
*  that he had offered some [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1160.8799999999999s)]
*  information to CIA. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1162.32s)]
*  I don't know exactly what it was, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1163.68s)]
*  but it was factored into his [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1165.56s)]
*  sweetheart deal. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1167.1599999999999s)]
*  He did travel a lot. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1168.32s)]
*  He was friends with Ehud Barak. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1170.28s)]
*  He was constantly among [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1172.44s)]
*  powerful people. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1175.24s)]
*  He picked up things and [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1178.76s)]
*  he passed it along and [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1179.84s)]
*  that was a factor in his [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1180.68s)]
*  sweetheart deal. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1181.76s)]
*  Do I think he also did that with [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1183.68s)]
*  other intelligence agencies? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1185.16s)]
*  I don't think Epstein was a [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1187.6s)]
*  particularly upstanding gentleman. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1188.8s)]
*  So I think it's possible. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1190.68s)]
*  I just don't have any, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1193.72s)]
*  I've never had any data to suggest [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1195.64s)]
*  that or know anything about that. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1198.2s)]
*  But I know that the people he [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1200.92s)]
*  spent time with certainly had [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1202.84s)]
*  those contacts. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1205.16s)]
*  He knew people at the highest [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1207.12s)]
*  levels of many governments. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1208.52s)]
*  And I could see them seeing him as [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1210.56s)]
*  being a useful person. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1212.32s)]
*  I mean, it's really unclear to me [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1213.6399999999999s)]
*  how a guy who was a high school [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1215.44s)]
*  math teacher suddenly becomes [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1217.08s)]
*  a billionaire, right? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1218.72s)]
*  He was a high school math teacher. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1220.12s)]
*  Right, he was a high school math [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1222.48s)]
*  teacher. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1223.84s)]
*  No, I know that's what's funny. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1224.36s)]
*  I mean- [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1225.72s)]
*  Lex Wexner is the only reason he [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1226.24s)]
*  has billions of dollars. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1228.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1230.08s)]
*  I mean, he was teaching at Dalton [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1231.24s)]
*  trying to pick up students. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1232.96s)]
*  They had to get rid of them. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1235.12s)]
*  Bill Barr's father actually was [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1235.96s)]
*  like you're done, you're out. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1237.6s)]
*  So hold on, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1240.12s)]
*  I want to talk about that more. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1240.76s)]
*  So first for the audience, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1242.28s)]
*  Ahud Rock's former [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1243.9599999999998s)]
*  Prime Minister of Israel and [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1245.1599999999999s)]
*  the person who gave Epstein [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1247.04s)]
*  the sweetheart deal back in I think [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1248.7199999999998s)]
*  2008 in down in Miami was Acosta [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1250.8799999999999s)]
*  who then later became Trump's labor [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1252.84s)]
*  secretary in his first term. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1255.08s)]
*  And he was a- [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1257.04s)]
*  And his lawyer was Ken Starr. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1257.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1260.0s)]
*  Epstein's lawyer was Ken Starr, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1260.52s)]
*  who you all know. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1262.36s)]
*  Yeah, that is so curious, right? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1263.4399999999998s)]
*  So tell- [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1266.6s)]
*  Well, he hired Republicans and [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1267.12s)]
*  Democrats when he did this. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1268.8s)]
*  He made sure to have the full [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1270.72s)]
*  gambit. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1272.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1273.8799999999999s)]
*  So that he could work every angle. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1274.4s)]
*  So tell us about Lex Wexler. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1276.12s)]
*  You said he picked him up and [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1278.48s)]
*  turned him into a billionaire. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1279.8s)]
*  Who is he? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1281.36s)]
*  Lex Wexner is the billion, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1283.64s)]
*  excuse me, yeah, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1286.48s)]
*  the billionaire behind Victoria's [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1288.32s)]
*  Secret. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1291.96s)]
*  He created Victoria's Secret. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1293.12s)]
*  And now he's disgraced, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1295.32s)]
*  I believe the board took it away [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1297.32s)]
*  from him. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1299.56s)]
*  But I mean, he's obviously someone [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1300.76s)]
*  that Epstein would be attracted to. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1303.0s)]
*  He's the man who creates Victoria's [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1305.32s)]
*  Secret Angels, right? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1307.92s)]
*  He had access to the runway show, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1309.44s)]
*  the lifestyle. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1312.0s)]
*  And they became very good friends. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1313.76s)]
*  In fact, Jeffrey Epstein helped [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1316.0s)]
*  introduce Les to his wife, Abigail. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1318.56s)]
*  And it's very weird because most [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1322.12s)]
*  people say that Les was not exactly [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1323.76s)]
*  a party animal. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1325.6399999999999s)]
*  He wasn't like Jeffrey who liked [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1326.44s)]
*  to be out and about. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1328.04s)]
*  But they were very close to the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1329.0800000000002s)]
*  point where they had houses right [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1330.8400000000001s)]
*  next to each other. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1332.8400000000001s)]
*  And there was a tunnel that [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1334.16s)]
*  connected the two houses on [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1335.3600000000001s)]
*  the Upper East Side. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1336.64s)]
*  These are the largest mansions in [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  and Epstein bought Les's apartment [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1339.8400000000001s)]
*  for $20 million markedly under [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1342.48s)]
*  rate, like underpriced. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1344.64s)]
*  Their relationship is very weird [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1346.4s)]
*  to the point where some people [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1348.44s)]
*  suggested that they might be [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1350.24s)]
*  lovers, that they were that close. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1352.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1354.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, the underground tunnel, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1354.76s)]
*  connecting their houses. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1356.32s)]
*  I mean, especially knowing Epstein, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1357.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean that reeks of creepy. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1361.0s)]
*  So, but if Les wasn't into that [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1363.6399999999999s)]
*  lifestyle, but somebody's [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1368.36s)]
*  collecting comprimont, maybe [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1372.04s)]
*  connects to the people who are [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1375.24s)]
*  collecting the comprimont. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1377.6399999999999s)]
*  But it's impossible not to ask [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1380.24s)]
*  questions because there's a- [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1382.04s)]
*  The biggest bucket of comprimont [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1383.8s)]
*  the world has ever seen. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1386.64s)]
*  And the idea that the intelligence [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1389.3600000000001s)]
*  agencies would not be interested [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1391.6000000000001s)]
*  in that is preposterous. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1393.96s)]
*  And then he shows up dead in [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1395.56s)]
*  a maximum security prison in [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1397.24s)]
*  America with the video camera not [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1399.14s)]
*  working in the hallway and [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1401.34s)]
*  the guards on break and [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1403.0s)]
*  his roommate removed. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1404.4s)]
*  All right, so let me ask you that. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1405.96s)]
*  I'm with you though. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1406.76s)]
*  I think it's very suspicious. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1407.48s)]
*  I'm not very conspiratorial. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1408.92s)]
*  I'm really not. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1411.04s)]
*  I try to live in the fact world, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1411.84s)]
*  but there are a lot of coincidences [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1413.44s)]
*  in that story. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1416.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's, and there was the [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1418.2s)]
*  cop from Long Island inside of the, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1421.88s)]
*  who people say, I mean, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1425.2800000000002s)]
*  CBS News suggested he could have [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1427.0800000000002s)]
*  been paid off privately. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1429.44s)]
*  You know, that's to do it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1431.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't know as much about that [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1432.52s)]
*  one. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1433.88s)]
*  So look, for just real quick, so [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1434.4s)]
*  you know, Tara, I said lime on the [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1436.92s)]
*  air when we found out that he got [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1439.6000000000001s)]
*  I said if the camera in the hallway [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1442.72s)]
*  is working, then it was a suicide. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1444.8s)]
*  If the camera in the hallway was [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1447.04s)]
*  not working, then he was killed. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1448.96s)]
*  And when we found out later the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1451.36s)]
*  camera isn't working, I'm like, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1453.08s)]
*  there are no coincidences that [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1455.08s)]
*  large, like the most valuable [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1456.84s)]
*  prisoner. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1458.72s)]
*  He bragged that he was Trump's boy, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1459.48s)]
*  that Trump was his boy and that he [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1461.32s)]
*  would never prosecute him. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1463.08s)]
*  He did that just years before he [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  was arrested. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1466.6s)]
*  Yeah, and then all of a sudden he's [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1468.08s)]
*  so despondent that he's going to [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1469.6s)]
*  kill himself when he thinks Trump's [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1471.0s)]
*  never going to prosecute him. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1472.72s)]
*  And by the way, he's a very good [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1473.88s)]
*  reason for believing that they were [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1474.96s)]
*  friends for a long time. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1476.32s)]
*  And when Ghislaine Maxwell was [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1477.32s)]
*  arrested and they asked Trump about [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1478.8s)]
*  it, he said twice that she's [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1480.48s)]
*  a very fine person. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1481.84s)]
*  So again, he knows her. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1483.24s)]
*  I mean, that is an unbelievable [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1484.88s)]
*  thing to say about the top groomer [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1487.04s)]
*  of our lifetimes. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1489.36s)]
*  For the president to say that is [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1491.48s)]
*  just stunning. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1492.88s)]
*  But tell me more about the cop. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1493.64s)]
*  I'm happy you called her a groomer [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1494.8s)]
*  by the way, because that is what [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1496.28s)]
*  she was. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1497.68s)]
*  And she's often in a inappropriate [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1498.2s)]
*  and disrespectfully to these [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1500.6s)]
*  girls called a madam. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1502.7199999999998s)]
*  And it's like, no, you cannot be [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1504.52s)]
*  a madam to a 14 year old, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1506.4399999999998s)]
*  they're children. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1507.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1509.48s)]
*  textbook rumor, textbook. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1510.56s)]
*  Yeah, horrible what she did. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1512.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and not a fine person, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1514.4399999999998s)]
*  a terrible person, right? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1515.8799999999999s)]
*  So okay, so you were saying about [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1517.9199999999998s)]
*  the Long Island detective. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1519.4399999999998s)]
*  Tell me more about that. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1520.76s)]
*  Well, there's a cop in Long Island [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1522.6799999999998s)]
*  and I remember that 60 minutes at [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1524.1599999999999s)]
*  a very long piece about what you [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1525.7199999999998s)]
*  talked about. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1527.4399999999998s)]
*  The fact that he would have to have [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1528.6s)]
*  hung himself with the sheets and [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1530.76s)]
*  the guards were asleep and [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1533.52s)]
*  the cameras off. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1535.92s)]
*  And the way that these, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1540.4s)]
*  what happens inside of prisons. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1542.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1544.36s)]
*  pedophiles don't do well in prison, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1545.12s)]
*  by the way. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1546.44s)]
*  They're often the first to be [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1546.96s)]
*  killed. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1548.6s)]
*  They even for criminals who commit [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1549.16s)]
*  murder and do other heinous acts, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1551.52s)]
*  the lowest of low in a prison is [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1553.84s)]
*  a pedophile. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1555.84s)]
*  And so they are often targeted. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1557.6s)]
*  But there's a possibility, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1559.76s)]
*  they suggested that this police [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1561.64s)]
*  officer from Long Island could have [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1563.84s)]
*  been paid off by someone to do this. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1566.56s)]
*  Now, he wouldn't obviously get [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1569.4s)]
*  the money directly, but [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1571.1200000000001s)]
*  it would be go to his family. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1572.4s)]
*  So I always thought, check out [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1574.1200000000001s)]
*  around his neighborhood and see if [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1575.52s)]
*  they all of a sudden have new cars [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1577.2s)]
*  or they're updating their houses or [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1578.8s)]
*  they're buying a boat. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1580.52s)]
*  But that's sort of how it's done. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1581.68s)]
*  It's not like this idea that [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1583.32s)]
*  they're climbing into the jail [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1587.0s)]
*  house. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1590.12s)]
*  It's like they had El Chapo in [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1592.36s)]
*  there. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1594.04s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy to think about [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1594.56s)]
*  the level. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1596.8s)]
*  This prison has held some of [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1597.6s)]
*  the most important detainees we've [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1601.0s)]
*  ever really had. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1605.24s)]
*  And I just think- [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1607.04s)]
*  Yeah, there's one thing- [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1608.28s)]
*  It's a coincidence. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1609.64s)]
*  Yeah, Tara, in my opinion, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1611.4s)]
*  there's one thing that's just [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1612.84s)]
*  inarguable. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1614.2s)]
*  There is no force on Earth that can [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1615.6399999999999s)]
*  kill someone inside a maximum [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1617.56s)]
*  security prison in America and [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1619.12s)]
*  not have either the Democrats or [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1620.9199999999998s)]
*  the Republicans turn them in. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1622.84s)]
*  And that's one of the- [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1625.7199999999998s)]
*  It wasn't a maximum security [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1626.3999999999999s)]
*  prison and it did have its flaws. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1627.6799999999998s)]
*  I do remember that the New York [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1629.3999999999999s)]
*  Post pointed out that this prison [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1630.8799999999999s)]
*  wasn't a great one. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1632.6399999999999s)]
*  But still, you have a very high [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1633.9599999999998s)]
*  profile prisoner in there. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1635.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and so I hear you on that and [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1638.8s)]
*  it's a good clarification and [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1640.6799999999998s)]
*  correction that it wasn't maximum [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1642.4399999999998s)]
*  security, by the way, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1644.4s)]
*  he should have been in maximum [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1645.68s)]
*  security, right, especially given [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1647.24s)]
*  what happened. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1649.16s)]
*  But still, having that person [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1650.1200000000001s)]
*  killed inside a prison and [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1652.0800000000002s)]
*  then neither side outs who did it, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1653.8400000000001s)]
*  it's gotta be an intelligence [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1656.2s)]
*  agency. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1658.24s)]
*  There's no other force on Earth [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1658.8000000000002s)]
*  that could do that other than [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1661.1200000000001s)]
*  either CIA or Mossad or both. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1663.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, I suppose it could be [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1666.16s)]
*  a different intelligence agency. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1667.2800000000002s)]
*  Or you pay someone to do [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1668.68s)]
*  the inside job, or you're right. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1669.88s)]
*  Or someone- [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1671.88s)]
*  But why wouldn't they release [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1673.4s)]
*  the files then if it's some rando? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1675.0400000000002s)]
*  No, to kill Epstein? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1678.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1679.96s)]
*  I don't know, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1680.48s)]
*  I think there's just really, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1681.5600000000002s)]
*  really powerful people, I think, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1683.64s)]
*  that are involved in that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1686.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, there you go. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1688.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think they're on both sides [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1689.72s)]
*  because even the way he handled [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1691.5600000000002s)]
*  the first case against him, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1693.44s)]
*  which was somehow brought down to [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1695.16s)]
*  prostitution of a child, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1697.0800000000002s)]
*  of a 14-year-old. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1698.6000000000001s)]
*  As if you can solicit, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1699.68s)]

*  prostitution. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1703.0800000000002s)]
*  That's what his first charge was [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1704.28s)]
*  back in, it was 2001 or 2000, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1706.5600000000002s)]
*  yeah, no, no, it was 2008, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1708.88s)]
*  excuse me. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1710.96s)]
*  2008, I think. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1711.8000000000002s)]
*  Exactly, 2008. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1712.8000000000002s)]
*  And first of all, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1715.5600000000002s)]
*  that's an absurd charge. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1716.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1718.24s)]
*  A 14-year-old can't be [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1718.76s)]
*  a prostitute. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1720.0s)]
*  But they worked every political [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1721.1200000000001s)]
*  angle they could possibly work. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1723.16s)]
*  They hired the lawyers when they [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1725.2s)]
*  had to deal with at the county [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1726.92s)]
*  level, the Democrats, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1728.44s)]

*  lawyers they could possibly find. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1731.72s)]
*  When they had to go to and [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1733.72s)]

*  the top Republican lawyers they [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1737.4s)]

*  They worked it all the way up to [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1740.1200000000001s)]
*  the AG when George W Bush was [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1741.68s)]
*  president. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1743.2s)]
*  So it was like he had the money to [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1743.8000000000002s)]
*  buy everyone, everyone was bought. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1746.48s)]

*  that. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1752.2800000000002s)]

*  it doesn't take one year, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1768.0s)]

*  we know that they were with [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1792.8s)]
*  underage girls. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1794.56s)]
*  So what's the reason not to release [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1795.8799999999999s)]
*  the names? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1798.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1799.04s)]
*  I think maybe, I hope that it is [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1800.56s)]
*  to protect the women. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1804.96s)]
*  I mean, some of them, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1810.16s)]
*  this is traumatic to have [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1811.44s)]
*  information to have out there [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1812.96s)]
*  without your consent. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1815.72s)]
*  I mean, a lot of women don't talk [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1816.84s)]
*  about sexual abuse or [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1818.4399999999998s)]
*  the violence committed against [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1819.56s)]
*  them because it's re-traumatizing. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1821.1999999999998s)]
*  But Tara, we already know that they [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1823.56s)]
*  got traumatized and we already know [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1825.48s)]
*  unfortunately a lot of the women's [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1827.4399999999998s)]
*  names. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1829.56s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that they [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1830.12s)]
*  want all the details of it out [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1831.4399999999998s)]
*  there. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1832.6399999999999s)]
*  No, but it doesn't have to be [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1833.24s)]
*  details, it could just be the names. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1834.3999999999999s)]
*  And I don't see how that further [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1835.8s)]
*  traumatizes anyone, because it's [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1837.1999999999998s)]
*  not the names of the victims, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1838.8s)]
*  it's the names of the clients. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1840.04s)]
*  It's very complicated. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1841.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, it took me a really long [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1842.84s)]
*  time to earn the trust of the [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1844.48s)]
*  victims, the survivors. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1846.04s)]
*  But a lot of them still, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1847.72s)]
*  they don't want to talk about it. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1849.52s)]
*  There's been a number of suicides, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1851.96s)]
*  it's not just Virginia Joufray. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1854.48s)]
*  It's really hard psychologically [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1856.92s)]
*  what they've been through. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1859.44s)]
*  And I don't know, listen, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1861.88s)]
*  I don't know that the government [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1863.56s)]
*  has decided that they want to think [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1865.48s)]
*  about the psychological impact on [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1867.44s)]
*  these young women. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1869.44s)]
*  But I do think that if you got [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1870.64s)]
*  a phone call from the FBI and [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1872.4s)]
*  hey, we're going to release [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1874.72s)]
*  the details around your assault and [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1876.36s)]
*  the person who did it. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1878.56s)]
*  And this is going to cause [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1880.0s)]
*  a news cycle. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1881.44s)]
*  And this is going to cause [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1882.48s)]
*  reporters to call you or this or [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1884.28s)]
*  that, it's really, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1886.76s)]
*  it's really, really hard. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1888.64s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1891.0s)]
*  There's a reason they go by [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1892.84s)]
*  Jane Doe. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1893.96s)]
*  I know, usually Jane Doe's come [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1894.72s)]
*  forward and they say I'm the Jane [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1896.64s)]
*  Doe, and I'm going after John Doe, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1898.68s)]
*  right? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1900.76s)]
*  But when the details of their [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1901.36s)]
*  cases come out without [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1903.52s)]
*  their permission, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1905.0s)]
*  that's when it gets difficult, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1906.24s)]
*  even when they are Jane Doe's. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1908.32s)]
*  Yeah, listen, that is definitely [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1910.28s)]
*  true of the women and I can [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1912.32s)]
*  understand why they would be [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1913.96s)]
*  re-traumatized if you got into [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1915.68s)]
*  the details or their names, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1917.72s)]
*  their identities, the acts, etc. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1919.48s)]
*  But I'm not buying that the US [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1921.8799999999999s)]
*  government is so concerned about [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1923.8s)]
*  re-traumatizing the victims that [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1925.96s)]
*  that is why they're hiding the [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1928.32s)]
*  names of the guilty. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1930.48s)]
*  I think they're hiding the names [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1932.28s)]
*  of the guilty because they care [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1934.1599999999999s)]
*  more about the clients that did [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1936.0s)]
*  these terrible things than they [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1937.84s)]
*  care about the women who suffered [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1939.6399999999999s)]
*  from it. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1941.56s)]
*  Listen, you may be right, and [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1942.12s)]
*  I'm not trying to cover for [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1944.12s)]
*  the US government, but I see that [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1945.84s)]
*  side of the coin. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1948.2s)]
*  But I think that what they should [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1949.56s)]
*  do rather than release the names [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1951.76s)]
*  is actually stand up a trial and [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1953.96s)]
*  actually indict these victims, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1956.12s)]
*  because I think that's a [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1958.32s)]
*  good way to do it. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1959.72s)]
*  Actually indict these people, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1960.92s)]
*  make them pay for the crimes [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1962.5800000000002s)]
*  rather than just shame them [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1964.0400000000002s)]
*  publicly and then they can deny it. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1965.44s)]
*  They actually put together a case, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1967.2800000000002s)]
*  prosecute them, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1969.3200000000002s)]
*  like a Jigalane Maxwell. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1970.3600000000001s)]
*  Isn't that amazing that they're not [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1972.24s)]
*  prosecuting these known pedophiles? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1974.72s)]
*  They know that they did it, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1977.64s)]
*  they literally have them on tape. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1979.64s)]
*  And they're saying, golly gee, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1982.2s)]
*  we just can't. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1984.2s)]
*  No, there's the American [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1985.68s)]
*  government, however they're [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1986.8000000000002s)]
*  compromised, whether it's CIA or [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1988.44s)]
*  anything else, is definitely [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1990.24s)]
*  compromised in this case. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1992.36s)]
*  There is no other logical [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1994.32s)]
*  explanation for why not to [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1996.1200000000001s)]
*  prosecute pedophiles when you have [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=1998.1200000000001s)]
*  them on tape as pedophiles. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2000.96s)]
*  It's just not, no, they're [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2003.32s)]
*  protecting those people for [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2005.32s)]
*  whatever reason. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2007.4s)]
*  And they're- [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2009.0s)]
*  I have to, yeah, I agree. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2009.96s)]
*  And I have to say that I have never [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2011.52s)]
*  seen the tapes, to be clear. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2013.36s)]
*  I just know from the girls that [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2015.0s)]
*  everything, they believe everything [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2016.96s)]
*  that they see, yeah, that's because [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2020.0400000000002s)]
*  it was taped because it was [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2021.92s)]
*  compromised. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2023.4s)]
*  But so anyways, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2024.1200000000001s)]
*  it's super interesting. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2025.16s)]
*  I love that we had this [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2026.8400000000001s)]
*  conversation. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2028.1200000000001s)]
*  To me, everybody can draw different [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2028.92s)]
*  conclusions. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2031.48s)]
*  The conclusions that I draw have [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2032.88s)]
*  become even more firm. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2035.0400000000002s)]
*  That there's, I would be shocked, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2036.96s)]
*  shocked if it wasn't an intelligence [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2039.44s)]
*  agency. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2041.92s)]
*  I mean, theoretically, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2042.64s)]
*  I guess it could be the British. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2043.68s)]
*  They don't seem as likely, but [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2044.8000000000002s)]
*  they had Prince Andrew, right? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2046.2s)]
*  But it's gotta be an intelligence [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2047.48s)]
*  agency. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2049.16s)]
*  No one else could kill someone in [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2049.7599999999998s)]
*  a US president like that and [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2051.68s)]

*  he was a secretive guy. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2064.3599999999997s)]
*  I did another podcast on Robert [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2065.72s)]
*  Maxwell, Galen Maxwell's father, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2067.56s)]

*  a part of Mossad. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2070.96s)]
*  He died mysteriously falling off [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2072.08s)]
*  his yacht. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2075.0s)]
*  No, of course he did. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2076.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and the Lady Galen, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2078.44s)]
*  he named after his daughter and [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2080.36s)]

*  connected Lady Galen with Jeffrey [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2084.48s)]
*  Epstein. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2086.96s)]
*  So it's never been proven, but [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2087.96s)]
*  he's believed to be the matchmaker [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2089.7200000000003s)]

*  was formed. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2095.04s)]

*  But you can understand where she [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2103.56s)]
*  came from. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2105.08s)]
*  Daddy was a lot like Epstein. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2105.64s)]

*  dad was a Mossad agent. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2117.48s)]
*  And then the rest of it kind of [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2119.6s)]
*  falls into place. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxPEXgszEKc&t=2121.24s)]
