TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

*  What's amazing about that guys is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=82.0s)]
*  that no one else on that panel [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=86.02s)]
*  realizes that that's not even [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=88.58s)]
*  remotely true. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=91.22s)]
*  That's not within miles of true, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=93.18s)]

*  I mean MAGA is pro war, right? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=102.18s)]
*  Right, MAGA is pro war. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=104.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, totally agree. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=105.86s)]
*  And even Scott Jennings is like, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=107.34s)]
*  yeah, MAGA is great and Sununu who [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=108.82s)]
*  fought Trump the entire time, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=110.34s)]

*  So when Trump said it, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=113.42s)]

*  Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=129.6s)]

*  a rude awakening, potentially could [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=146.82s)]
*  get a rude awakening tonight. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=148.7s)]

*  populist is going to be on that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=152.26s)]

*  to use their own nukes and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=522.96s)]
*  be held culpable for that? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=524.48s)]
*  No, they're going to get a moron [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=525.88s)]
*  like Donald Trump to do their dirty [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=527.88s)]
*  work for them so that when the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=529.96s)]

*  it's not against Israel. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=533.3000000000001s)]
*  They would say, well, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=535.12s)]
*  I had nothing to do with it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=536.64s)]
*  I'm not America, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=539.12s)]
*  And that rage is going to be [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=541.72s)]
*  directed to all of us. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  And then mainstream media is going [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=544.52s)]
*  to come and tell you they hate us [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=545.5799999999999s)]

*  They hate us because they hate us. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=549.9s)]
*  Look, are they going to do that? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=551.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=552.2199999999999s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  That is, look, it's just one [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=553.3399999999999s)]
*  reference. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=555.3s)]
*  Don't over panic about it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=555.9799999999999s)]
*  But it was a weird, weird thing. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=559.14s)]
*  Guys, I got to show you [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=560.6999999999999s)]
*  the Charlie Kirk poll. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=561.42s)]
*  So later in the show, in fact, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=562.6199999999999s)]
*  the next story we'll do after [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=564.18s)]
*  the break is about MAGA that's [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=565.5799999999999s)]
*  turned on Trump. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=567.26s)]
*  And that's why you're seeing this [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=568.3s)]
*  battle in this war between neocons. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=569.9799999999999s)]
*  Everybody we just read from is [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=571.78s)]
*  neocon or a Christian Zionist all [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=573.84s)]
*  either working for Israel or [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=576.24s)]
*  have some deranged genocidal [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=578.32s)]
*  fantasies of their own like [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  Huckabee does, okay? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=582.7600000000001s)]
*  So Charlie Kirk asked his own [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=584.6800000000001s)]
*  audience, I remember Charlie Kirk [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=586.12s)]
*  said, I love Israel, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=587.6s)]
*  I love Israel, Israel the greatest. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=590.44s)]
*  But I'm a little concerned. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=590.96s)]
*  Why is he a little concerned? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=592.0s)]
*  because his own audience is like, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=592.88s)]
*  are you kidding me, Charlie? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=594.32s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=595.7600000000001s)]
*  We all said anti-war. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=596.96s)]
*  So he does a poll. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  And let's find out, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=600.44s)]
*  is MAGA really anti-war or not? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=601.48s)]
*  Maybe it's 50-50, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=603.46s)]
*  maybe it's 90-10. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=604.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what it was, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=605.46s)]
*  90-10 against the war. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=608.0600000000001s)]
*  Charlie Kirk's audience, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=610.22s)]
*  deeply right wing, 90 to 10, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=612.7s)]
*  not interested in this war, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=615.34s)]
*  not interested in Huckabee's BS, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=617.7s)]
*  not interested in all these neocons. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=620.2600000000001s)]
*  And a lot of what MAGA is saying [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=623.0200000000001s)]
*  all over the internet, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=624.5400000000001s)]
*  I know if you haven't seen it, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=625.7s)]
*  you think, really, that can't be. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=627.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, four years ago, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=628.86s)]
*  they all agreed with Trump no [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=630.0200000000001s)]
*  matter what. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=631.34s)]
*  Well, it's a different MAGA. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=632.6s)]
*  And this time around, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=634.44s)]
*  they mean a lot of what they say. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=635.92s)]
*  And so what they're saying is, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  listen, brother, we didn't pick you [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=640.64s)]
*  to be America's second. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=642.84s)]
*  We said anti-war, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  we meant anti-war. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=645.52s)]
*  And if you're pro-war and [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=646.92s)]
*  you're just going to serve Israel, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=647.96s)]
*  we're not interested. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=649.8000000000001s)]
*  So that's why there's this huge [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=651.52s)]
*  drift, and that is why they're [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=653.16s)]
*  trying to keep Trump in a little [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=655.08s)]
*  bit of a cocoon, where they're [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=657.08s)]
*  like, don't, don't, don't, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=658.96s)]
*  just watch TV. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=660.62s)]
*  Turn on Fox News for him, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=662.06s)]
*  turn on Fox News. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=662.9s)]
*  That's why Steve Bannon and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=663.9s)]
*  Tucker Carlson are attacking Fox [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=665.04s)]
*  News, which is what we're going to [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=666.38s)]
*  show you next. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=667.7s)]
*  So they're like, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=668.5s)]
*  don't talk to Tucker, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=669.98s)]
*  Tucker's kooky. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=671.38s)]
*  Tucker's not even on TV. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=672.54s)]
*  That's why Trump said, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=673.58s)]
*  Tucker's not even on TV, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=674.48s)]
*  because somebody whispered that in [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=675.62s)]
*  his ear. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=676.98s)]
*  Don't do and don't watch anything [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=677.8199999999999s)]
*  that isn't on TV, because then you [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=679.62s)]
*  might find out that your base has [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=681.3s)]
*  left the building, okay? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=682.8199999999999s)]
*  So he doesn't realize it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=684.86s)]
*  But when those new poll numbers [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=686.62s)]

*  like 29 or something? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=695.38s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=696.6s)]
*  Yes, I do, because no one wants [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1q_H83m0&t=697.8000000000001s)]
