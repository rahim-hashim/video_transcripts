TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

TYT is also available as a podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, TuneIn, Amazon Music, and more.

# Cenk Explains Why He‚Äôs REMOVING A Contributor From TYT Network
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ)
*  Recently, Francesca Fiorentini asked us at TYT to take her podcast, Abituation Room, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=0.0s)]
*  off the network. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=7.68s)]
*  And we happily agreed to that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=8.68s)]
*  And today, I'm going a little further, and I'm gonna take Francesca off the network entirely. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=10.44s)]
*  So you won't see her on any of the TYT shows going forward. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=15.92s)]
*  So I want you guys to know why I'm doing that and how this whole situation isn't really [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=19.68s)]
*  about Francesca. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  It's about TYT, our community, and what we stand for. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  And so we're for open minds and open hearts. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=30.52s)]
*  And so I want all of you to know that, and I wanna build a community that believes in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=33.76s)]
*  that and invites people in that believe in the same things. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=40.68s)]
*  And by the way, if you don't believe in the same things, then you say, no, no, no, I have [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=44.0s)]
*  a strict ideology and I have no open mind about that, no problem. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=46.96s)]
*  There are tons of shows out there for you guys. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=51.36s)]
*  So first of all, we've had some disagreements, I certainly have, with some of the far left. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=54.04s)]
*  But I think they've been relatively small. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=58.6s)]
*  But if you think that they've been large, no problem. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  So they've been around the issue of crime. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=63.96s)]
*  Did crime rise between 2019 and 2023? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=66.88s)]
*  Well, that's a fact, it did. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=69.68s)]
*  But it's okay, we could have different interpretations of it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=74.88s)]
*  That's not an issue at all. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=77.16s)]
*  We certainly are against police abuse and we've fought against it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=79.2s)]
*  I would argue at least as much as any show on the planet and perhaps a lot more. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=84.0s)]
*  And I take great pride that Benjamin Crump, among others, said that Trayvon Martin would [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=89.16s)]
*  not have gotten anywhere near the national coverage that he did if it wasn't for the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=94.04s)]
*  Young Turks. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  So nevertheless, we could have disagreements about specific policy issues. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=98.52s)]
*  And we do on slogans and framing, etc. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=102.68s)]
*  For example, defund the police, Latinx. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  These are normal disagreements within any community. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=108.0s)]
*  I certainly would never wanna shut that down because we're again for open minds. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  And of course, we've had some disagreements on the issue of trans. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=115.88s)]
*  Let me just transgender rights. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=118.64s)]
*  Let me just say quickly what my position is, cuz a lot of people outside of the network [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=120.44s)]
*  have been misleading you about this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=125.44s)]
*  So I'm for 100% constitutional rights for transgender Americans, because why they're [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=127.72s)]
*  Americans just like the rest of us? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  And they should have the same exact rights as us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=134.46s)]
*  They should be protected in bathrooms. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=136.56s)]
*  They should definitely be allowed to serve in the military. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=137.88s)]
*  And I happen to think that they should be allowed to play, transgender girls should [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=140.26s)]
*  be allowed to play in women's, in girls' sports, in high school. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=144.45999999999998s)]
*  Now, my position on that is not overall popular in the country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=149.1s)]
*  I understand that, and I have a strategy for hopefully how to win on that in the long run. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=152.7s)]
*  But I don't believe that they should be mandated to play in college and professional level. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=158.06s)]
*  I think the league should get to make those decisions on their own. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=164.62s)]
*  I think that that is a small disagreement. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=167.66s)]
*  Obviously, others think that's a giant disagreement. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=169.66s)]
*  But that's again not the issue here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=172.54s)]
*  I think what the issue is, is when others among the issues is when others say only my [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  opinion is the correct one, the moral one. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  Everyone who disagrees with me is unintelligent, immoral, collaborator, etc. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=185.14s)]
*  Well, we'll get to the specifics on Francesca in a second. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=189.38s)]
*  I'm saying that generally. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=191.9s)]
*  And then they speak for the left. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=194.46s)]
*  Well, let's find out if they do speak for the left. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=196.14s)]
*  This is a little bit of Francesca, a little bit of Emma Vigeland from Majority Report [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=198.02s)]
*  and spliced in is the actual facts about what the American people think and interestingly, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  what Democratic voters think. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  First let's watch this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=209.02s)]
*  I'm a big messy fan, so, but let me- [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=210.02s)]
*  Answer my question. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  Would you allow him if he said I'm a woman to play in the American women's basketball [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  team? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, right now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  Hell yeah, are you kidding me? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  Transgender female athletes in women's sports. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  Only 18% of the country says that they should be in fact allowed to participate in women's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=226.94s)]
*  sports. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=232.94s)]
*  Your argument is really bad on this and you're out of your depth. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=233.94s)]
*  You're correct that trans women should be able to compete in women's sports, but your [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=235.7s)]
*  argument for it is just scientifically and factually incorrect. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=237.78s)]
*  I'm actually not bad about this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=239.66s)]
*  I'm 100% right on this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=241.06s)]
*  I don't give a **** the scientific explanations. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=242.84s)]
*  People, if they identify as a woman, get to compete in sports. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=245.22s)]
*  If that's not fair in the short term for a variety of little competitions, I don't give [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=247.82s)]
*  a ****. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=252.02s)]
*  My goodness gracious, 79%. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=253.02s)]
*  You rarely get 79% of the country to agree on anything. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=255.58s)]
*  Because the societal interests of including trans people in society trumps stupid competition, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=259.42s)]
*  full stop. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=264.1s)]
*  So I'm right about this, you're wrong about this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=265.1s)]
*  You'd let Lionel Messi play in the women's national football team and destroy women's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=267.38s)]
*  football forever. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=271.3s)]
*  You'd let Usain Bolt- [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=272.3s)]
*  I mean, it'd be very difficult to get a ticket, which would suck. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=273.3s)]
*  I wanna do a little checklist here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=276.3s)]
*  You'd let Usain Bolt compete as a sprinter in the American women's Olympic team? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=281.98s)]
*  You would let Floyd Mayweather compete as a boxer in the women's American boxing team? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=283.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=288.70000000000005s)]
*  Opposing them in women's sports. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=289.70000000000005s)]
*  You get 67% of Democrats, so two-thirds there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=290.70000000000005s)]
*  You get 64% of independents, you get about two-thirds there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  So I'm right about this, you're wrong about this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  Okay, generally speaking, if you wanna say that you're right about something, sure, everybody [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  has their own opinions, then it's their opinions. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=304.82s)]
*  That's why they think that they're right. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=306.90000000000003s)]
*  It's another thing to say that you speak for the left. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  As you just saw there, 67% of Democrats have a position that is actually to the right of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=310.82s)]
*  mind. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=316.34s)]
*  I say that trans girls should be allowed to play in girls' sports in high school. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=317.34s)]
*  67% of Democrats say no, not allowed in any women's sports. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=320.86s)]
*  So I'll work on my Democratic brothers and sisters, and I'll try to get them to my position [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=325.9s)]
*  on that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=331.42s)]
*  Nothing wrong with disagreements. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=332.42s)]
*  And if Emma Francesca and others can convince 79% of the nation that is opposed to that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=334.9s)]
*  to come over to that side, fantastic, happy to have it, okay? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=341.02s)]
*  So I think where the issue comes in is when things get personal. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=345.29999999999995s)]
*  So we got three rules, generally speaking, on air here at TYT that are relatively bright [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=348.32s)]
*  lines. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=354.46s)]
*  So one is, and I say relative, I'll explain that in a second. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=355.46s)]
*  One is no lying, two is no threats of physical violence. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=358.66s)]
*  And number three is don't denigrate personally the other host in the network over and over [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=363.82000000000005s)]
*  and over again. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=369.62s)]
*  And I say relatively bright lines because it should be relatively easy to follow, but [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=370.62s)]
*  I get that people have disagreements about, hey, what's a lie? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=373.94000000000005s)]
*  Are what they say about crime stats a lie or not? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=377.74s)]
*  No, I'm not going to nitpick that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=380.02000000000004s)]
*  And we get into heated debates from time to time, me and Ben Glebe in the past, me, Ben [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=382.06s)]
*  Manquitz, me, Michael Schor, etc. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=386.85999999999996s)]
*  And I love those debates. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=389.73999999999995s)]
*  And somebody might cross the line and say something they shouldn't know, but we usually [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=390.9s)]
*  hug it out. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=393.9s)]
*  And so I'm not nitpicking here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=394.94s)]
*  What we're looking for is, hey, are we all rowing generally in the same direction or [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=396.78s)]
*  someone was drilling holes in the boat? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=402.14s)]
*  And so are you doing it over and over again on purpose to try to create an issue? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=405.02s)]
*  Or even if you're not trying to do it, you are creating an issue by constantly attacking [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=410.7s)]
*  our own. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=414.9s)]
*  I have applied this two other times, which I'll tell you about in a minute. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=415.9s)]
*  This all started, unfortunately, when I went on Francesca's show. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=420.46s)]
*  And we had what seemed like a normal conversation and debate about this issue until it made [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=424.06s)]
*  a turn. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=430.85999999999996s)]
*  And this is part of the turn. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=431.85999999999996s)]
*  Let me show you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=432.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm reminded of the book by, I think his name is Michael Schneider on tyranny. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=433.85999999999996s)]
*  And he wrote, it's like 20 lessons from the 20th century about authoritarianism and fascism. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=439.56s)]
*  And one of the things that has come to mind when you say my strategy will protect us is [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=444.7s)]
*  he has this chapter. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna bring it up, the first part of it called Do Not Obey in Advance. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=451.65999999999997s)]
*  And he writes, most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given in times like these individuals. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=454.97999999999996s)]
*  Think ahead about what a more repressive government will want and then offer themselves without [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=460.48s)]
*  being asked. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=465.26s)]
*  A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=466.26s)]
*  In other words, you don't have to do the sort of crackdown on the left around speech cuz [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=470.54s)]
*  I'm gonna do it for you or you don't have to come to me. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=477.54s)]
*  Again, you're misstating it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=480.98s)]
*  I'm doing the exact opposite. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  You're cracking down by saying, Cenk, you're out of bounds. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=484.3s)]
*  So you should stop your stupid opinion. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=487.38s)]
*  And because you're implicating me. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=489.54s)]
*  I can't believe that a guy who I like did used to admire and who I thought had a lot [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=491.58000000000004s)]
*  of fight is trying to scratch the back of people who absolutely would never do the same [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=496.34s)]
*  for them. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=503.09999999999997s)]
*  So we just spent an hour and a half of me explaining how I'm not scratching their back. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=504.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm trying to get- But I can show you more clips, man. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=507.97999999999996s)]
*  Their populist degree with us on things we believe in and we've always believed in. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=509.97999999999996s)]
*  And you go back to scratching their back. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=513.3s)]
*  At least the trains will run on time. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=515.1s)]
*  The train's running on time, presumably a reference to Germany. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=518.98s)]
*  I'm the collaborator and I'm scratching the right wings back by having my opinion. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=522.42s)]
*  The opinion I've always had and the opinion I've had for years and you guys have seen [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=527.98s)]
*  for years on the show. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=531.26s)]
*  But if you don't agree with Francesca in that particular case and some other folks in the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=533.7s)]
*  extreme left, well, you're not allowed to have that opinion. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=539.56s)]
*  That is immoral by definition. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=543.56s)]
*  And how dare you disagree with them? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=545.62s)]
*  That makes you a right winger, a collaborator, etc. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=547.72s)]
*  But if you say, hey, Cenk, look, I know that she's quoting someone collaborating with [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=549.66s)]
*  another authoritarian government and saying that that's what you're doing and you're helping [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=554.38s)]
*  the right wing. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=557.48s)]
*  And then she's not open to the idea of, hey, maybe there's a different strategy and a different [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=558.5799999999999s)]
*  opinion on this. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=563.5s)]
*  That gets us the same result protecting trans folks or whichever topic we're talking about. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=564.86s)]
*  Okay, and at that point, I certainly hadn't done anything. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=569.86s)]
*  I think that that was, I didn't appreciate that, but that's okay. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=573.42s)]
*  We kept going and she's been on the network since. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=577.56s)]
*  Then she started to do more and more and more and it got more and more personal. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  So after that discussion, this happened. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=586.1199999999999s)]
*  I like that we can both be very Mediterranean about it and get super mad, but then rein [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=590.52s)]
*  it in and be cool and then be like, we're like, yeah, we're just going to yell and then [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=594.8399999999999s)]
*  we're going to be fine and then we're going to get over it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=598.64s)]
*  So that's the kind of beer I like to have. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  Two days later. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, I have my own thoughts on why he's doing it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  I think if you think your brain was broken by the 2024 election, I think we're looking [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  at a case where someone's brain was broken even harder. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=616.16s)]
*  Okay, so but look guys, if she had said that about another host, I probably would have [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=620.44s)]
*  drawn the line there. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=625.88s)]
*  But it's about me, so I wanted to give more leeway, my brain is broken. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=626.88s)]
*  And by the way, that's still okay, the first time she's getting super personal collaborator, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=630.12s)]
*  maybe that's a political opinion. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=636.08s)]
*  Now we're a broken brain even though we were supposed to have a beer and we were supposed [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=637.44s)]
*  to hash it out and be okay afterwards, but apparently not okay afterwards. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=640.92s)]
*  But then that was the tip of the iceberg. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=644.68s)]
*  She continued again and again. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=646.32s)]
*  Here's the next one. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=648.32s)]
*  I do think it's sad that even though they allow people like us into the fold and the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=649.32s)]
*  fray, they refuse to learn from us or listen to us. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=654.52s)]
*  And I think that when you have been doing this work for so long, and you still cannot [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=658.2s)]
*  grasp the idea of intersectionality, how race and gender and class all intertwine with one [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=664.6s)]
*  another and how the right, the fascist goal is to divide us based on these lines. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=671.7800000000001s)]
*  I don't even know if you're smart, you know what I mean? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=678.76s)]
*  I don't even know, first of all, I don't know who your political mentors are. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=685.32s)]
*  I don't know who you look up to. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=688.8s)]
*  I don't know what your touchstones are. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=690.44s)]
*  I don't know if you know your history in terms of civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=692.12s)]
*  struggle in this country. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=697.44s)]
*  I don't know anything. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=699.4s)]
*  I call into question all of that. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=701.12s)]
*  It sounds like you are just an opportunistic mouthpiece who wants clicks time and time [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=703.44s)]
*  again. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=709.52s)]
*  Okay, so obviously it's getting deeply personal there, opportunistic mouthpiece, can't grasp [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=711.96s)]
*  simple concepts, not smart. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=717.88s)]
*  But guys, and I'm not angry, look, people have different opinions and they wanna make [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=720.32s)]
*  it personal, it is what it is, right? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=725.16s)]
*  I'm more sad about it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=727.92s)]
*  I'll say something at the end about that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=729.8s)]
*  But to me, the attitude that is toxic, and that's what I don't want at TYT, I wanna build [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=733.32s)]
*  a community that is really open to conversations is they refuse to learn from us. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=739.28s)]
*  So the idea is, well, obviously I'm right and the only moral center of the universe. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=747.52s)]
*  And I already told him that, and this guy wouldn't even learn from me. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=753.6s)]
*  It's just such a deeply arrogant thought that if someone disagrees with you, they need to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=758.56s)]
*  be re-educated. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  And maybe they haven't read any books at all. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=767.12s)]
*  Okay, did she stop there? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=769.48s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=771.2s)]
*  And yes, as I told Cenk, I do feel very implicated. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=772.2s)]
*  I have felt implicated by their takes specifically around crime and policing in years past. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=776.68s)]
*  Definitely by this new heel turn since Trump's reelection and absolutely by the misrepresentation [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=784.68s)]
*  of the Los Angeles fires and who the responsibility lies on. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=793.72s)]
*  It is enraging to say the least. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=798.96s)]
*  The Los Angeles fires are not the responsibility of the mayor. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=804.8s)]
*  They're apparently responsibility of Republicans. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=809.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=811.2s)]
*  I don't know what her thought on that is and I don't know why she's enraged by that, but [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=812.2s)]
*  that's okay. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=815.36s)]
*  It's apparently I've taken a heel turn. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=816.36s)]
*  By the way, all those folks, not just Francesca, but others I told you were right wing. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=817.36s)]
*  You watch the show every single day you see us criticizing Trump and Elon Musk over and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=820.9599999999999s)]
*  over and over and over again telling you how they're gonna do a four and a half trillion [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=825.12s)]
*  dollar robbery in those tax cuts. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=828.1999999999999s)]
*  Yesterday we talked about how they're already hammering social security and costing good [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=830.12s)]
*  Americans what they need from social security. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=836.4399999999999s)]
*  How they're gonna cut $800 billion from Medicaid. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=840.4799999999999s)]
*  How there's a series of robberies on the way, etc. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=843.1999999999999s)]
*  But it's okay. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=845.62s)]
*  Let's just simplify things and say anyone who disagrees with us a little bit is a right [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=846.78s)]
*  winger. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=850.24s)]
*  But the good news is at least Francesca will not be implicated anymore. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=851.24s)]
*  And I never understood that because she's been saying this for a long time now that [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=854.8s)]
*  she was implicated by us. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=858.16s)]
*  Then why keep taking the check? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=860.52s)]
*  And it's not a big check in Francesca has had a career before us. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=861.88s)]
*  She talks about that. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=866.02s)]
*  Of course, of course she did. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=867.02s)]
*  And she'll have a career after us. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=868.02s)]
*  There's no problem with that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=869.72s)]
*  So why if you think we're collaborators and we've taken a heel turn and we're working [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=870.72s)]
*  with fascists, why did you choose to get implicated with us all these days? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=874.78s)]
*  But good news, no longer implicated. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=880.26s)]
*  Believe it or not, she did not stop there. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=883.42s)]
*  This is now another show. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=885.74s)]
*  Watch. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=887.9399999999999s)]
*  So Cenk's line up until this point has been no, no, no, it's at the collegiate level and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=888.9399999999999s)]
*  above. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=893.22s)]
*  I think once you get to the college level and above, that's when it's bad. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=894.22s)]
*  So he would be on board with what the NCAA said recently. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=896.18s)]
*  But you're so dumb. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=900.22s)]
*  You're so dumb. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=903.22s)]
*  I don't even know how to explain it to you anymore. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=905.78s)]
*  Unless, unless, this is the other option, unless you also are a transphobe. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=908.94s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=915.02s)]
*  Unless you also are kind of a misogynist. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=916.02s)]
*  Because if you disagree with Francesca or anyone on that part of the spectrum, well, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=921.22s)]
*  you must be a misogynist. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=926.22s)]
*  You must be collaborating with the fascists. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=928.04s)]
*  And obviously you must be unintelligent. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=930.72s)]
*  Now if I had called her dumb, I wonder what her reaction would have been. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=932.76s)]
*  My guess is nuclear. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=937.6s)]
*  But I didn't call her that because we have a disagreement. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=939.68s)]
*  We have a political disagreement. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=942.24s)]
*  You don't need to make it personal. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=943.84s)]
*  Not done yet, one last one. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=946.04s)]
*  What has it got you? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=948.92s)]
*  What did it get you? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=950.8s)]
*  When you go and share a stage with Dr. Phil, what did it get you? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=952.64s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=959.04s)]
*  You know why? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=961.08s)]
*  Because you look like a bitch. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=962.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=965.4s)]
*  You look like a bitch. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=967.12s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=968.12s)]
*  That's just what it comes down to. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=970.92s)]
*  You don't look like a fighter. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=972.1999999999999s)]
*  You don't look smart. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=975.08s)]
*  You look like a bitch. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=977.84s)]
*  That's just the reality. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=980.8s)]
*  I've tried to tell it to you nicely. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=982.24s)]
*  I've tried to tell it to you cordially. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=984.2s)]
*  I've tried to tell it to you on your show, on my show, on every show. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=987.0s)]
*  And so either you, A, are a bitch, or [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=991.92s)]
*  B, you actually agree with the right. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=997.56s)]
*  And I'm starting to think, in fact, I do think it's the latter. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1003.2s)]
*  Okay, so again, if I had called her that, that would have been a different situation, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1006.68s)]
*  right? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1013.3199999999999s)]
*  But look, guys, also on the policy or the strategy, when you go talk to the right wingers, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1014.3199999999999s)]
*  first we did that, and I mainly did that. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1020.8s)]
*  And there was a lot of blowback saying, don't ever talk to the right wing. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1023.3199999999999s)]
*  But they won the popular vote. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1027.28s)]
*  How are we going to win back the voters if we never talk to them? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1029.28s)]
*  If we don't win them back, we can't ever win an election. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1032.12s)]
*  And that doesn't mean the far end of MAGA, it means the independents that voted for Trump [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1034.6s)]
*  and maybe some right wing populists that voted for Trump. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1038.1999999999998s)]
*  Now I've noticed that that faction is now saying, well, I mean, of course we should [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1041.56s)]
*  talk to the right, but we should only yell at them or we should only accost them. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1047.1599999999999s)]
*  That seems like a really productive conversation. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1052.56s)]
*  And now I guarantee you they'll say, no, no, no, no, no, I don't mean just yell at them. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1054.86s)]
*  But just build coalitions, as Francesca said recently. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1059.36s)]
*  Apparently she's changed her mind about being a collaborator. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1062.92s)]
*  But not with Trump voters. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1067.0s)]
*  Well, who would it be if it wasn't Trump voters? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1068.88s)]
*  Those folks on the edge of the middle of the spectrum were that we gotta bring to our side. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1070.92s)]
*  We've gotta convince them that the populist left is right, not necessarily a populist [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1076.6000000000001s)]
*  right or parts where we agree, hey, great, let's work together on that. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1080.0800000000002s)]
*  So who are we building coalitions with if it isn't the other side or people who voted [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1084.14s)]
*  in the other direction? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1087.76s)]
*  And if we talk to them, what are we doing? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1088.76s)]
*  Are we literally screaming fascists in their face or are we having a human conversation? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1090.6s)]
*  So look, this is not an attitude that I agree with. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1094.9199999999998s)]
*  Again, there are other shows that love what she's saying. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1097.1599999999999s)]
*  And no problem, to each his own, it's a free country. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  Go and love that and yell and scream and do all the things that you wanna do. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1103.2199999999998s)]
*  But do you think that after you do a joint appearance with Dr. Phil or anyone else, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1106.28s)]
*  that the very next day all of them are just gonna show up and go, I changed my mind. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1110.76s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1114.08s)]
*  No, this is a gradual process where Americans begin to talk to one another and start to [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1115.08s)]
*  learn about each other and starts, that's what you mean. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1119.76s)]
*  That's how you perceived it. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  And we begin to have human conversations until we understand each other. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1124.6000000000001s)]
*  Again, if you don't wanna understand them and you don't wanna do that, plenty of other [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1127.84s)]
*  shows. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1131.84s)]
*  So she said, I tried to tell him nicely, did you? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1132.84s)]
*  Did you? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1135.96s)]
*  Cuz I might have missed that part. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1136.96s)]
*  All right, guys, you get it by now. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1138.64s)]
*  Look, there's two other times that I enforce this rule. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1140.32s)]
*  One was when Sam Seder was doing it to Jimmy Dorn. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1143.44s)]
*  They were both in the network. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1146.24s)]
*  And the same show was not only in the network as part of our YouTube partner group. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1148.24s)]
*  And that's what we were doing early on. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1153.72s)]
*  And I was happy and thrilled with all the folks that were in it before. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1156.04s)]
*  And then we stopped doing that since then. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1160.64s)]
*  So God bless, no problem with that. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1163.08s)]
*  And in terms of Sam and others leaving at different points from that network we were [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1165.56s)]
*  trying to set up. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1171.8s)]
*  But while they were in the network, I said, Sam, you can disagree with Jimmy all you want. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1174.48s)]
*  And in fact, I agree with you on the policy you're criticizing him on. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1178.32s)]
*  But stop doing personal insults. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1182.34s)]
*  You're doing personal insult after personal insult. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1184.64s)]
*  So I talked to him about that. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1188.94s)]
*  He wouldn't agree. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1190.72s)]
*  He loved the personal insults. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1191.72s)]
*  He wanted to keep going. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1192.72s)]
*  And apparently, that's a thing that he does like it. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1193.88s)]
*  That's what he likes to do every time, apparently. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1196.24s)]
*  And so, okay, that's Sam. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1198.44s)]
*  But we did enforce it before. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1200.68s)]
*  And then ironically, the second time we enforced it was against Jimmy Dore when he was doing [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1202.14s)]
*  it to Francesca. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1206.94s)]
*  And he'd called her a neffing liar. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1208.0200000000002s)]
*  And he said that she was a paid chill, which is a classic go to move for Jimmy. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1210.14s)]
*  Although he misspelled it paid chill, which sounds pretty nice. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1217.6200000000001s)]
*  And I said, Jimmy, you can't do that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1221.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, ironically, he's the only one who actually apologized and said, I won't do it [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1224.38s)]
*  again and he apologized to Francesca. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1228.74s)]
*  Francesca apparently thought, great, I'm allowed to do this, but no one's allowed to [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1231.22s)]
*  do it to me anyway. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1235.8600000000001s)]
*  You guys get it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1237.1200000000001s)]
*  So like I said, I want everybody wrong in the same direction cuz we're trying to build [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1238.3s)]
*  something here. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1242.64s)]

*  Cuz we want our movement to be strong. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1245.66s)]
*  We wanna get message to get out there. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1249.44s)]
*  We wanna win over those voters. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1251.8600000000001s)]
*  Because the bottom line in all of this is eyes on the prize. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1254.02s)]
*  You've heard me say that year after year after year. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1259.74s)]
*  What's the prize? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1262.38s)]
*  The prize, by the way, note to other online hosts, is not more subscribers. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1263.54s)]
*  The prize is passing bills cuz those are the only things that affect our voters, our audiences, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1269.66s)]
*  their actual lives. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1276.88s)]
*  Let's pass paid family leave. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1278.6200000000001s)]
*  Let's pass Medicare for all, higher wages, etc. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1280.1s)]
*  And I hope wherever you are on the left wing spectrum, or the middle, or wherever you are, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1283.44s)]
*  I hope that you agree. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1287.9s)]
*  And I hope that we all work together in trying to pass those bills. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1289.3s)]
*  So please, eyes on the prize. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1292.82s)]
*  And so look, I'm gonna show you two charts here for a reason. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1294.46s)]
*  Some media matters to this chart recently. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1297.94s)]
*  You guys, some of you might have seen it on air. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1301.4199999999998s)]
*  And it has the right wing shows online in red, and it has the left wing shows online [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1304.46s)]
*  in blue, okay? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1311.3799999999999s)]
*  What we did there, I hope you can see it, is we put a little bit of a green circle around [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1313.7s)]
*  the TYT show. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1317.6599999999999s)]
*  So the Young Turks is right next to Rogan. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1318.86s)]
*  We got 12 million subscribers, one of the largest ones in the whole chart. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1320.3s)]
*  But Rebel headquarters is also on there. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1324.9399999999998s)]
*  Damage Report is on there. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1327.3s)]
*  Indisputable Dr. Rashad Richie is on there. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1328.74s)]
*  And when you put them together, that's 18.8 million. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1330.9799999999998s)]
*  And it is one of the largest presence in online media, period. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1333.9399999999998s)]
*  If you include our alumni, people that have been in part of the TYT network in one way [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1341.06s)]
*  or another throughout the years, they were a 30.1 million subscribers with the way that [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1344.82s)]
*  Media Matters does it. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1351.5s)]
*  Today, actually, when you include all the platforms that we're on, some of which Media [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1352.82s)]
*  Matters did not count, we have 27 million subscribers. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1357.62s)]
*  Now, why do I tell you that? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1360.9399999999998s)]
*  Because guys, we're trying to build something. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1362.8999999999999s)]
*  Fox News has dominated this course in this country for at least 20 years, almost 30 now. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1366.54s)]
*  And they've made an enormous difference, and I think for the worse, for the much, much [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1373.82s)]
*  worse. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1378.3799999999999s)]
*  We're trying to build a network that makes a difference for the better. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1379.3799999999999s)]
*  But by the way, you don't have to agree with us, and you don't have to say, well, okay, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1383.06s)]
*  then great, and we should help you and support you. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1387.34s)]
*  No, you don't have to do that. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1389.26s)]
*  Build something of your own. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1391.1399999999999s)]
*  Instead of being destructive over and over and over again, how about you be constructive? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1393.82s)]
*  And you say, hey, Cenk, I don't like the way you guys are doing the TYT network. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1399.3s)]
*  And I see that you've had this huge success, and you've given rise to other progressives [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1403.32s)]
*  that are now having success. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1407.6799999999998s)]
*  And it seems like you helped to build something for our side. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1409.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, you know what though, these days I don't agree with you. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1411.56s)]
*  So I'm gonna build something larger. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1413.72s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1415.8s)]
*  I would love that. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1416.8s)]
*  And whether you build something larger or not, you built, let's say you, instead of [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1417.8s)]
*  building a media company or a media show, you built a platform that actually got Democrats [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1421.2s)]
*  elected, but progressive populist Democrats like Bernie Sanders, Ro Khanna, etc. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1426.72s)]
*  And then they got those bills passed. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1431.84s)]
*  My God, I would love you for it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1433.36s)]
*  Please do that. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1435.9599999999998s)]
*  Build something positive. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1437.28s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to do here, okay? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1438.28s)]
*  So and I don't say this just for Francesca, and the reason I'm doing this segment isn't [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1441.28s)]
*  just for her or to explain what's going on. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1444.28s)]
*  But I do wanna be clear with you. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1447.1999999999998s)]
*  It's mainly to tell you what we stand for. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1448.4399999999998s)]
*  Not just the media end of it, not just the host, but as a community. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1451.28s)]
*  We all have to be open minded and open hearted enough to get these things done and push forward. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1455.3799999999999s)]
*  So look, last thing is, I wish Francesca well. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1460.36s)]
*  She said those things and I get it, we've got bad feelings these days. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1465.12s)]
*  But all the power to her, okay? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1468.9599999999998s)]
*  If she can convince the country to be on her side on all these issues, even the ones we [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1471.76s)]
*  disagree on, terrific. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1476.86s)]
*  Go do try that. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1479.56s)]
*  Try to make that happen. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1481.6399999999999s)]
*  And no problem, happy to have it. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1482.9199999999998s)]
*  Like she said, good career before, I'm sure she will afterwards. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1484.8s)]
*  You can go check her out wherever she is. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1487.8799999999999s)]
*  So I don't have hard feelings, I'm not angry, I'm just done with it. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1490.12s)]
*  I want a positive atmosphere here where we fight for you guys. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1493.4799999999998s)]
*  And we do that in all different ways. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1498.28s)]
*  So if some hosts have a different idea on how to do it, great, let's have that conversation. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1501.26s)]
*  We've had that conversations, those debates, those discussions, so we can get to the right [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1505.6999999999998s)]
*  answer and so we could help you guys decide what you believe instead of what we believe. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1509.6s)]
*  So for folks who don't wanna be part of that, bless your hearts. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1514.32s)]
*  Go get them tiger, okay? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1518.56s)]
*  But for folks who think, yeah, that's a great idea. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1520.36s)]
*  And I'd love to pass the things that are in your populist plank. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1523.16s)]
*  Six incredibly popular policies, higher wages, anti-war, etc. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1526.2s)]
*  Get money out of politics. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1532.52s)]
*  So if we can do that together, whether we disagree on some issues or not, wonderful. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1534.36s)]
*  But whatever you do, please roll forward. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1539.62s)]
*  Please be mindful of others that are in this community. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1542.22s)]
*  Care for each other, love each other, and let's try to be positive together. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1547.4s)]
*  Let's go build something as we always do at TYT. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1551.88s)]
*  Love you guys, we'll be right back. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eaMiN30TuQ&t=1554.5600000000002s)]
