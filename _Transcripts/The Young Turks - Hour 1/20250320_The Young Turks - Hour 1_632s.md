"Federal prosecutors arrested and charged the alleged leader of a Los Angeles Crips gang subset who they claim posed as an anti-gang activist, the U.S. Attorney said.

Eugene Henley Jr., 58, also known by the alias "Big U," is the lead defendant named in a criminal complaint that was unsealed Wednesday. The court documents accuse Henley, a prominent leader of the Rollin' 60s chapter of the larger Los Angeles Crips, of running a "mafia-like organization" known as "Big U Enterprise."*

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Alleged LA Gang Leader Who Ran Non-Profit Charged With SEVERAL Federal Crimes
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM)
*  I'm gonna turn myself in to see [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=0.0s)]
*  what's going on. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=2.0s)]
*  They talking about I'm a fugitive. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=3.18s)]
*  Music executive Eugene Henley or [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=5.74s)]
*  Big U taking to Instagram moments [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=7.86s)]
*  before turning himself in and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=10.06s)]
*  just hours after federal [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=11.96s)]
*  authorities declared him [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=13.42s)]
*  a fugitive Wednesday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=15.0s)]
*  They just raided all my houses. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=16.7s)]
*  Mr. Henley operated Big U [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=18.18s)]
*  Enterprises, a mafia like [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  organization. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Federal authorities have arrested [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=26.3s)]
*  Eugene Henley, a Crips gang leader [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  who they accuse of murder, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  kidnapping, robbery, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=33.44s)]
*  extortion and fraud. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=35.18s)]
*  So Henley is facing RICO charges as [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=37.08s)]
*  a result of this lengthy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=39.339999999999996s)]
*  investigation that was carried out [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=41.04s)]
*  by federal authorities. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=43.46s)]
*  And it's a pretty embarrassing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=45.459999999999994s)]
*  moment for local government here in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  Los Angeles, especially considering [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=48.8s)]
*  the fact that his nonprofit was [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=50.86s)]
*  able to receive millions of dollars [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=52.5s)]
*  in taxpayer resources. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=54.5s)]
*  He then took that money and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  according to federal officials, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=57.36000000000001s)]
*  put it in his pocket. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=59.540000000000006s)]
*  So federal authorities likened [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  Henley's Big U Enterprise to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  a mafia like organization that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=65.84s)]
*  relied on his stature and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=68.10000000000001s)]
*  long standing association with [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=70.02000000000001s)]
*  the rolling 60s and other street [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  gangs to intimidate businesses and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=75.0s)]
*  individuals in LA. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  So Henley actually previously [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  served 13 years in prison after he [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=81.16s)]
*  tried to rob an undercover [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=83.4s)]
*  sheriff's deputy of 33 pounds of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=85.3s)]
*  cocaine in 1991. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=87.54s)]
*  So he was under the assumption that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=88.7s)]
*  he was going to meet with a drug [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=90.9s)]
*  dealer and the plan was to rob [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=92.7s)]
*  the drug dealer. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=94.58s)]
*  Turns out that the alleged drug [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=95.9s)]
*  dealer was actually a sheriff's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=97.86s)]
*  deputy working in a sting operation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=99.78s)]
*  And so Henley got arrested, served [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=102.44s)]
*  13 years in prison and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=104.6s)]
*  was released in 2004. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=105.98s)]
*  Now Andrew Rusa, a special agent [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=107.38s)]
*  with the FBI says that Henley [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=109.26s)]
*  simultaneously attempted to create [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=110.9s)]
*  an air of legitimacy for [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=113.08s)]
*  the Big U Enterprise by promoting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  himself as a reformed gang member [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=116.64s)]
*  focused on bettering his community. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=118.8s)]
*  Now during their investigation, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  authorities recovered 49 weapons, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=124.6s)]
*  5 pounds of meth, no, I'm sorry, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  10,000 fentanyl pills and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=129.64s)]
*  large amounts of cash. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=131.38s)]
*  And more than a dozen of Henley's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=133.48s)]
*  associates have also been arrested. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=135.32s)]
*  In fact, four of them were already [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=137.16s)]
*  in custody before this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=139.2s)]
*  investigation had finished. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=140.64s)]
*  And the affidavit is a 107 page [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  federal complaint. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=146.3s)]
*  In it, the authorities detail that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=150.54000000000002s)]
*  as part of Henley's purported grip [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=152.58s)]
*  on Los Angeles, his alleged victims [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=154.54000000000002s)]
*  were required to check in with [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  Henley before arriving in the city [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=158.34s)]
*  in order to obtain protection. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=160.46s)]
*  And at that point, he would [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=162.5s)]
*  allegedly extort all sorts of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=164.46s)]
*  people and that includes big names [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=166.66s)]
*  like celebrities, professional [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=169.0s)]
*  athletes, musicians. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=171.18s)]
*  And on top of that, he is accused [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=172.68s)]
*  of defrauding donors and taxpayers [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=175.02s)]
*  who he basically persuaded to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=177.64s)]
*  donate to his nonprofit and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=179.82s)]
*  charities. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=182.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=184.04s)]
*  Officials also claim Henley used [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=185.84s)]
*  his nonprofit organization [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=187.84s)]
*  developing options, which purported [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=189.68s)]
*  to help sat risk youth to dupe [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  taxpayers, the county of Los [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=193.76s)]
*  Angeles and NBA players. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=195.56s)]
*  He allegedly embezzled hundreds of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=198.12s)]
*  thousands of dollars worth of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=200.2s)]
*  funds and grants by transferring [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=201.94s)]
*  money into his personal bank [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=203.78s)]
*  account. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=205.33999999999997s)]
*  Y'all don't understand what the FBI [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=206.1s)]
*  do to black men who try to help [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  their community. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=209.26s)]
*  Yeah, but were you helping your [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=213.17999999999998s)]
*  community or were you stealing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=214.89999999999998s)]
*  money that was meant to help your [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=216.5s)]
*  community and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=218.14s)]
*  patting your pockets with it? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  That's the real question. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=219.98s)]
*  And that is what the federal [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=221.82s)]
*  authorities are accusing him of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=223.26s)]
*  doing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=224.98s)]
*  So after getting out of prison in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=225.77999999999997s)]
*  2004, following that 13 year prison [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=227.77999999999997s)]
*  sentence, he formed this nonprofit [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=230.08s)]
*  called Developing Options. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=232.4s)]
*  And it was a nonprofit that was [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=234.32s)]
*  supposed to provide underprivileged [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=236.44s)]
*  children with a safe outlet in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=239.12s)]
*  sports in order to prevent them [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=241.16s)]
*  from joining gangs. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=243.24s)]

*  taxpayer money gets funneled into [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=283.02s)]

*  other nonprofits that ended up [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=287.44s)]
*  defrauding taxpayers in the city. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=289.48s)]

*  in my opinion for [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  previous Los Angeles mayors. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=308.32s)]

*  But let's talk a little bit about [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  Karen Bass because before the FBI [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  announced the charges against [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=321.62s)]
*  Henley just days before, Karen Bass [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=323.62s)]
*  had this press conference where she [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=326.06s)]
*  was touting the GRID program and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=328.36s)]
*  how effective it is and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=330.38s)]
*  how wonderful it is. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=331.74s)]
*  We always hear about how great [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=333.18s)]
*  things are going in LA when you [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=334.74s)]
*  hear from Karen Bass, even as [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=336.38s)]
*  things are on fire and we can't get [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  police to show up when there's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=340.06s)]
*  an emergency. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=341.94s)]
*  But in her press release, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=343.82s)]
*  she didn't really mention anything [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=345.64s)]
*  about how you measure the success [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=348.32s)]
*  of these programs. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=350.76s)]
*  How do you keep track of these [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=353.52s)]
*  programs to make sure they're [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=354.92s)]
*  working? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=356.4s)]
*  And that's really the big problem [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=356.92s)]
*  that we're having in California in [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=358.88s)]
*  general, not just in LA, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=360.92s)]
*  when it comes to these public, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=362.46s)]
*  private partnerships. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=364.4s)]
*  Public private partnerships aren't [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=367.04s)]
*  just between the government and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=369.24s)]
*  a corporation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=371.04s)]

*  private nonprofits. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=375.14s)]
*  And we've got so [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=377.22s)]
*  many of them here in California. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=378.22s)]
*  Some of them that were established [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=380.5s)]
*  like in 2020 as the George Floyd [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  riots were happening, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=384.86s)]
*  It's a perfect opportunity to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  start a grift. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=389.18s)]
*  And when you don't have some sort [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=390.1s)]
*  of review process, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=392.38s)]
*  when there's no oversight to ensure [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=393.78000000000003s)]
*  that the money is being used the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=396.02s)]
*  way it's supposed to be used. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=397.9s)]
*  Well, then these individuals get [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  away with literally taking [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=402.22s)]
*  taxpayer money that was given to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=403.76s)]
*  them for a specific cause for [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=405.64s)]
*  a specific mission, and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=407.32s)]
*  they put it in their pockets. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=408.72s)]
*  That's how the state lost $24 [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  billion in five short years. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=412.68s)]
*  And that money was specifically [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=415.2s)]
*  allocated to help the homeless. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=416.52s)]
*  So not only were taxpayers robbed, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=418.24s)]
*  the homeless were robbed too. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=420.12s)]
*  But people weren't mad at [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=421.48s)]
*  Gavin Newsom about that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  They were mad at him for [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  having a conversation with [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  Charlie Kirk, but [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=428.0s)]
*  they couldn't be bothered to be [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  furious that that was [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=430.76s)]
*  the reason that that governor just [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=432.44s)]
*  squandered $24 billion in taxpayer [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=435.08s)]
*  money. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=438.0s)]
*  And now, by the way, the state is [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=439.72s)]
*  in so much financial trouble. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=441.96s)]
*  You have Gavin Newsom trying to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=444.52s)]
*  take out $6 billion loans in order [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=446.64s)]
*  to cover losses for [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=448.98s)]
*  our state Medicaid program. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=450.36s)]
*  This is the highest tax state in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=453.16s)]
*  the country. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=454.96s)]
*  LA, one of the highest tax cities [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=455.88s)]
*  in the highest tax state in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=458.12s)]
*  the country. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=459.96s)]
*  And we're having a conversation [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=462.44s)]
*  about we're not going to be able [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=464.04s)]
*  to cover what we need to cover [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=465.64s)]
*  with Medicaid, it's disgusting. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=467.04s)]
*  But let's get back to Karen Bass [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=468.92s)]
*  because when Karen Bass was asked [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=470.92s)]
*  about Henley and the fact that for [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=473.16s)]
*  years he ran this nonprofit, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=475.48s)]
*  received taxpayer money and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=477.48s)]
*  was transferring that money to his [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=479.48s)]
*  own personal bank accounts. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=481.78s)]
*  Bass's office was like, no, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=484.08s)]
*  we actually have a robust review [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=486.48s)]
*  process, okay. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=489.36s)]
*  So this is DeMarcus Finnell, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=492.16s)]
*  that's the press secretary for [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=493.86s)]
*  Mayor Bass. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=495.62s)]
*  The city has strict oversight in [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=496.4s)]
*  place, do they? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=498.2s)]
*  Do they have strict oversight in [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=500.0s)]
*  place? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=501.52s)]
*  This guy was receiving taxpayer [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=502.04s)]
*  money since 2011 and we're hearing [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=503.68s)]
*  now in 2025 that he was taking that [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=505.56s)]
*  money and putting it in his pocket. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=507.48s)]
*  What's the review process? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=510.28s)]
*  All right, let's continue. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=512.48s)]
*  However, the complaint alleges [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=513.28s)]
*  a sophisticated effort to thwart [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=515.12s)]
*  oversight for many avenues of [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=516.92s)]
*  funding, including the city. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=518.56s)]
*  No, it wasn't that complicated. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=520.5s)]
*  Homeboy took the money and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=522.58s)]
*  transferred it to his personal [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=524.28s)]
*  bank accounts. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=526.28s)]
*  There was no oversight, none, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=527.26s)]
*  none, none, unbelievable. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=531.3000000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't, look, and that's [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=535.7s)]
*  just the misuse of taxpayer money, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=537.7s)]
*  which is bad enough, but [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=540.02s)]
*  let's talk about murder, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=541.58s)]
*  which Henley's also accused of. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=543.26s)]
*  A years long FBI investigation has [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=546.66s)]
*  led to federal authorities [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=548.62s)]
*  accusing Henley of kidnapping and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  fatally shooting a young rapper by [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=551.9599999999999s)]
*  the name of Ray Sean Williams. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=554.06s)]
*  Shot him in the face allegedly. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  In January of 2021, Henley then [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=558.2399999999999s)]
*  fled after leaving the victim's [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=561.64s)]
*  body in a Las Vegas desert. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=565.0s)]
*  The alleged murder occurred due to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=568.3599999999999s)]
*  perceived disrespect over a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  diss track that Williams allegedly [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=572.88s)]
*  wrote about Henley. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  Now Henley was referenced as [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=577.0799999999999s)]
*  a fugitive yesterday as the FBI and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=579.3000000000001s)]
*  federal officials were announcing [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=581.7800000000001s)]
*  these charges. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=584.22s)]
*  But as you saw earlier in that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=585.38s)]
*  video, he did turn himself in. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=586.86s)]
*  He denies all of these charges. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=588.86s)]
*  It'll all be adjudicated in court. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=590.74s)]
*  If you want me to predict what [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=593.46s)]
*  the reality of the situation is, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=594.98s)]
*  I think he's probably guilty [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=596.82s)]
*  considering how long this [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=598.34s)]
*  investigation had gone on for. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=599.82s)]
*  Considering the evidence that [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=602.3000000000001s)]
*  the federal authorities claim they [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=603.84s)]
*  have, but here's what Henley says. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=605.58s)]
*  I ain't been nothing but [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=607.8s)]

*  somebody else don't like you. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=618.68s)]
*  Okay, yes, everybody is plotting [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  against Henley because he wants to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=621.92s)]
*  help his community, sure. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=623.52s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell below [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=625.16s)]
*  an angel gets his wings. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdcTQ-EWFBM&t=626.72s)]
