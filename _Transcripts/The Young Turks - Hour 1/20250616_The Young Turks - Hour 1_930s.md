"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) launched a scathing attack on what she called ‚Äúfake‚Äù MAGA Republicans she accused of betraying President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù doctrine by ‚Äúslobbering‚Äù for war with Iran.
Israel‚Äôs conflict with Iran has exposed fresh fractures within the MAGA movement as the potential for active U.S. involvement becomes a hot talking point that has split the president‚Äôs loyal followers."

TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# MAGA TURNS ON TRUMP!
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc)
*  I actually really love Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a deeply humane, kind person. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=2.2s)]
*  And I am saying this because I'm [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=5.28s)]
*  really afraid that my country is [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=7.68s)]
*  going to be further weakened by [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=10.06s)]
*  this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=12.3s)]
*  I think we're going to see the end [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  of American Empire, obviously. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=14.36s)]
*  Other nations would like to see [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=15.92s)]
*  that and this is a perfect way to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=17.44s)]
*  scuttle the USS America on [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=19.0s)]
*  the shoals of Iran. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  But it's also going to end, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=22.04s)]
*  I believe, Trump's presidency and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=23.68s)]
*  effectively end it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=25.68s)]
*  And so that's why I'm saying this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=26.8s)]
*  All right, so [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=30.0s)]
*  let's get into that part. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=30.56s)]
*  Israel's conflict with Iran is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=31.84s)]
*  exposing the cracks within [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=33.84s)]
*  the MAGA base as we've been [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=35.32s)]
*  discussing Trump's loyalists have [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=36.84s)]
*  found themselves divided, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=38.8s)]
*  including Tucker Carlson there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=40.4s)]
*  You just watched Tucker said more [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=42.6s)]
*  about why he feels this way. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=44.64s)]
*  But before we get to that jank, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  that last statement, that this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=48.72s)]
*  involvement deeper, going deeper [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  with Israel could end the Trump [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=53.64s)]
*  presidency, your thoughts? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=55.72s)]
*  Yeah, those are super strong [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=57.68s)]
*  words. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=59.28s)]
*  And so look, the Libertarians have [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=59.88s)]
*  left the building, we're going to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=61.78s)]
*  show you some of that in a second. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=63.6s)]
*  They're done with Trump. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=65.32s)]
*  And MAGA now still couching it in. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=67.76s)]
*  I mean, we really love Trump and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=69.6s)]
*  stuff, but his presidency is kind [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=71.52s)]
*  of over. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=73.6s)]
*  Wait till you see [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=75.68s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene, by the way, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=76.4s)]
*  also Jack Psobiak, Steve Bannon, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=78.2s)]
*  everyone, not everyone, but [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=80.12s)]
*  the great majority of MAGA and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  all of America first, some part of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=83.76s)]
*  MAGA is Israel first, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=85.8s)]
*  all of America first is like no to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=87.16s)]
*  this war, no, this is nothing new [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=89.2s)]
*  with America, I don't want to pay [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=91.2s)]
*  for it, we've got a lot more [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=93.2s)]
*  examples for you guys. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=94.98s)]
*  Yeah, so first up, we'll get more [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  of that conversation between [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=99.28s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=100.7s)]
*  The second you get enmeshed in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=103.68s)]
*  a real war, not a fake, let's go [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=105.68s)]
*  bomb the villagers and declare [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=107.68s)]
*  success, we don't even have a good [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=109.52s)]
*  track record, why the hootie is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=111.6s)]
*  still there? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=113.52s)]
*  There's a whole other question, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=114.52s)]
*  which is how prepared is the US [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=116.32s)]
*  military for a real conflict? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  And the answer is totally [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=119.8s)]
*  unprepared, scary unprepared, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  I don't think people understand [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=123.32s)]
*  But anyway, the only reason I'm [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  saying any of this is because I [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  really, really care. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  All right, so there's Tucker [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=132.28s)]
*  talking with Bannon, he also [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  criticized Trump in a newsletter. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=134.88s)]
*  Here's what he wrote, while [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=137.0s)]
*  the American military may not have [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=138.6s)]
*  physically perpetuated the assault, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=140.76s)]
*  years of funding sending weapons to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  the people, Trump just bragged about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=145.12s)]
*  on social, undeniably placed the US [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=147.12s)]
*  at the center of last night's event. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  Politicians purporting to be [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  America first can't now credibly [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=153.12s)]
*  turn around and say they had [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  nothing to do with it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump snapped back during [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  an interview with the Atlantic. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=160.8s)]
*  Well, considering that I'm the one [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  that developed America first and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=164.8s)]
*  considering that the term wasn't [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  used until I came along, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  I think I'm the one that decides [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=172.24s)]
*  For those people who say they want [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  peace, you can't have peace if [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=175.4s)]
*  Iran has a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=176.96s)]
*  So for all of those wonderful [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=178.2s)]
*  people who don't want to do [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=180.04s)]
*  anything about Iran having [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=181.84s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, that's not peace. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=183.68s)]
*  So then Tucker is back, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=186.44s)]
*  this time on X. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=188.04s)]
*  The real divide isn't between [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=189.88s)]
*  people who support Israel and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=191.52s)]
*  people who support Iran or [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=193.12s)]
*  the Palestinians. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=194.52s)]
*  The real divide is between those [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=195.64s)]
*  who casually encourage violence and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=197.48s)]
*  those who seek to prevent it, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=199.44s)]
*  between warmongers and peacemakers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=201.04s)]
*  Who are the warmongers? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=203.2s)]
*  They would include anyone who's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=205.32s)]
*  calling Donald Trump today to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=206.92s)]
*  demand airstrikes and other direct [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=208.4s)]
*  US military involvement and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=210.28s)]
*  a roar with Iran on that list. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=211.94s)]

*  Mirian Edelson. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=218.92s)]
*  At some point, they will all have [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=221.0s)]
*  to answer for this, but [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=223.12s)]

*  So there you have it, Newt Gingrich [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=514.54s)]
*  alluding to this preventative, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=517.62s)]
*  preempted war. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=520.6999999999999s)]
*  You got to replace the Ayatollah [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=521.6999999999999s)]
*  now you have to have regime change [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=524.3s)]
*  or else things are just going to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=526.9399999999999s)]
*  get worse. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=529.38s)]
*  This is necessary for Israel to [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=530.2199999999999s)]
*  amp things up and for [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=532.02s)]
*  the United States to help. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=533.18s)]
*  Yeah, so you see the old guard [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=535.5s)]
*  versus the new guard there. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  So the old guard Newt Gingrich, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=538.14s)]
*  Ted Cruz, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=539.66s)]
*  Yeah, war is awesome. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=541.98s)]
*  We have to serve Israel loyally. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=544.14s)]
*  Remember we're occupied and so [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  you've whatever Israel commands of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=548.74s)]
*  us we have to do. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=551.18s)]
*  We have to do regime change in [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=552.74s)]
*  Iran. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=554.54s)]
*  So no one's surprised by that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=555.3399999999999s)]
*  That was super obvious. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=557.3399999999999s)]
*  They're all corrupt. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=558.5799999999999s)]
*  They all get paid off by the special [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=559.54s)]
*  interests, the lobbyists, etc. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=561.6999999999999s)]
*  To say those things and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=564.14s)]
*  that's been true in America for [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=565.38s)]
*  so long. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=567.18s)]
*  So partly because of that, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=568.2199999999999s)]
*  partly because of how Maga stuck [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=569.62s)]
*  with Trump no matter what he said [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=571.1s)]
*  in his first term. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=572.5799999999999s)]
*  A lot of people on the left and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=573.78s)]
*  in the middle thought these guys [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=575.3399999999999s)]
*  are immovable, right? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=577.1s)]
*  And I said they were. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=578.86s)]
*  So I'm going to come back to that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=580.9s)]
*  in a second. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=581.9s)]
*  Let me actually finish off [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=582.42s)]
*  Gingrich and Ted Cruz for a second. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=583.74s)]
*  I don't want you to lose track of [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=586.5s)]
*  some switcheroo that they're doing [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=588.3399999999999s)]
*  right now. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=590.3399999999999s)]
*  And you saw it on those comments. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=591.06s)]
*  When Israel first attacked Iran, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=593.02s)]
*  they said, we have to take out [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=594.9s)]
*  their nuclear facilities. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=596.42s)]
*  They're going to have nukes any day [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=598.26s)]
*  now. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=599.66s)]
*  Then Netanyahu goes on Bear's show [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=600.18s)]
*  on Fox News this weekend. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=602.02s)]
*  And he says, just kidding, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=603.98s)]
*  they wouldn't have a nuclear [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=605.3s)]
*  weapon for at least a year. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=606.5799999999999s)]
*  Then why did you attack them now? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=608.8199999999999s)]
*  And you didn't say that a minute [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=611.02s)]
*  ago, you said that they were about [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=612.9s)]
*  to have the weapons, right? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=615.02s)]
*  And they said, well, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=617.42s)]
*  they have ballistic missiles, but [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=618.06s)]
*  almost everyone has ballistic [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=619.3s)]
*  missiles. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=620.5s)]
*  So should we attack everyone? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=621.3s)]
*  So that was the original reason, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=623.06s)]
*  but if you notice both when [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=624.8199999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu and now his servants, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=626.2199999999999s)]
*  Gingrich, Cruz, etc., [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=628.06s)]
*  they're all going, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=629.42s)]
*  we need regime change. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=630.78s)]
*  Wait, I thought you said it was [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=633.3399999999999s)]
*  take out the nukes and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=634.74s)]
*  the weapons of mass destruction. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=635.78s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=637.86s)]
*  instantly change to, no, we have to [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=638.86s)]
*  stay and fight there until we [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=640.94s)]
*  change their entire government and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=642.62s)]
*  presumably take over the country. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=644.7s)]
*  And can Israel take over Iran? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=647.66s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=648.98s)]
*  No, there's only one country [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=649.86s)]
*  powerful enough to take out their [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=651.34s)]
*  nuclear facilities and [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=652.86s)]
*  do a regime change. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=653.98s)]
*  That's America. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=655.1800000000001s)]
*  So now that we're in the war, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=656.78s)]
*  Israel sends all their dogs out to [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=658.86s)]
*  bark and yap and Ted Cruz goes, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=661.34s)]
*  regime change, regime change, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=663.58s)]
*  Sean Hannity, regime change. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=666.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, that's all normal. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=667.46s)]
*  That's what normally happens. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=669.1s)]
*  But now something unusual [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=671.34s)]
*  has happened. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=672.5s)]
*  I said in the beginning of [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=673.34s)]
*  the Trump administration that his [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=674.3000000000001s)]
*  coalition would not hold, that they [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=675.62s)]
*  would break from him and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=677.5s)]
*  they would oppose him at [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=678.62s)]
*  different times. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=680.02s)]
*  I further said that it would be on [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=682.26s)]
*  Israel and everyone said, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=684.46s)]
*  you're nuts, they're never going to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=686.58s)]
*  break their occult. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=689.1800000000001s)]
*  They will all listen to what Trump [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=690.98s)]
*  said, they're not actually anti-war [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=692.6600000000001s)]
*  and on Israel, are you kidding me? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=694.9000000000001s)]
*  They will loyally serve Israel. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=697.98s)]
*  Okay, you could hold on to your [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=701.94s)]
*  fantasies that they haven't broken. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=703.14s)]
*  But there's Dave Smith saying he [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=705.4200000000001s)]
*  should be impeached he voted for [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=706.7s)]
*  Trump. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=707.74s)]
*  There's Tim Dillon we showed you [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=708.78s)]
*  earlier, we got no business Iran. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=710.02s)]
*  This is not our war. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=712.34s)]
*  We got everybody saying it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=713.78s)]
*  We've got Tucker Carlson, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=716.5s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=717.58s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene was [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=718.58s)]
*  on this show, they said, you're [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=719.38s)]
*  crazy, she's not actually going to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=720.38s)]
*  oppose the war. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=721.5s)]
*  There she is opposing the war. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=722.34s)]
*  So look guys, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=724.58s)]
*  it isn't about told you. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=725.3000000000001s)]
*  It's about how do we assess what is [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=727.02s)]
*  true or not true? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=729.4599999999999s)]
*  How do we effectively fight back [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=731.54s)]
*  against things that we don't want? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=733.18s)]
*  So there's a lot that we don't want [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=735.42s)]
*  where the right wing is opposed to [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=737.62s)]
*  us. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=739.66s)]
*  So I don't want the National Guard [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=740.22s)]
*  and the Marines in the streets of [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=742.38s)]
*  LA or any other city, and [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=744.26s)]
*  I will fight them over that. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=745.78s)]
*  And we will fight very tough and [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=747.78s)]
*  very aggressively, okay? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=749.3399999999999s)]
*  But when they say they're anti-war [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=751.38s)]
*  and now all their media is saying [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=753.3399999999999s)]
*  they're anti-war, it doesn't even [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=755.14s)]
*  matter if they're lying, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=757.14s)]
*  like the media guys. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=758.46s)]
*  Because they're telling their [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=759.46s)]
*  audience is 24 seven, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=761.14s)]
*  Trump is wrong. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=762.38s)]
*  We shouldn't go into this war. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=763.82s)]
*  We should not back Israel. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=765.4200000000001s)]
*  So let's all wake up collectively [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=767.5s)]
*  together. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=769.58s)]
*  By the way, how did I know when no [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=770.78s)]
*  one else knew? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=772.1800000000001s)]
*  Because I did something crazy [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=773.74s)]
*  called talking to them and [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=775.26s)]
*  even more importantly, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=776.66s)]
*  listening to them. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=778.02s)]
*  No, you can't listen to them. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=779.46s)]
*  We have to be in our own tribes [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=781.78s)]
*  because our other tribe is evil. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=783.46s)]
*  They're evil, never listen to them. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=785.38s)]
*  Well, since you weren't listening, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=788.1800000000001s)]
*  you missed the fact that they're [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=789.82s)]
*  actually anti-war. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=791.26s)]
*  And they're super tired of serving [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=792.38s)]
*  Israel, not their politicians. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=794.1s)]
*  Their politicians are in lockstep. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=796.46s)]
*  By the way, a lot of our politicians [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=798.14s)]
*  are in lockstep with Israel, right? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=800.62s)]
*  But their voters are absolutely [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=803.9000000000001s)]
*  sick of it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=805.7800000000001s)]
*  And the Israeli supporters are in [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=806.5s)]
*  the middle of making a huge [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=808.58s)]
*  mistake right now. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=810.34s)]
*  They're starting to now do the same [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=812.18s)]
*  thing to them that they did to us. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=814.18s)]
*  They're starting to call the right [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=816.0999999999999s)]
*  wing and the libertarians anti-Semites. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=818.4599999999999s)]
*  Have at it, Hoss. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=822.38s)]
*  You go ahead, but [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=824.9399999999999s)]
*  that one trick pony is already dead, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=826.38s)]
*  okay? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=829.38s)]
*  And you're going to flog that dead [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=830.18s)]
*  pony, and then you're going to call [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=831.9s)]
*  all of America anti-Semites because [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=833.74s)]
*  we won't follow Israel's orders. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=835.78s)]
*  You're going to find out soon that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=838.78s)]
*  that's a very, very poor strategy. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=840.5799999999999s)]
*  If you thought that was a bad [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=842.5799999999999s)]
*  strategy to try with the left, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=843.78s)]
*  wait till you try it with the right [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=845.14s)]
*  and see how that turns out for you. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=846.66s)]
*  Okay, so let's review. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=848.6999999999999s)]
*  They won't turn on him, they did. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=851.2199999999999s)]
*  They won't fight each other. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=853.06s)]
*  They're at each other's throats. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=854.26s)]
*  You see that Tucker Carlson comment [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=855.74s)]
*  about Sean Hannity and Murdoch and [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=857.86s)]
*  calling out all those names, okay? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=859.9s)]
*  The coalition won't split, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=862.98s)]
*  it's split already. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=864.14s)]
*  I mean, you heard Dave Smith there [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=865.0999999999999s)]
*  and there's a lot more where that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=866.54s)]
*  came from. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=867.86s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene won't [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=868.42s)]
*  actually be against the war, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=869.9s)]
*  she's actually against the war. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=871.28s)]
*  So there's now a rebellion, and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=873.42s)]
*  the rebellion is joined. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=875.22s)]
*  So before it was the left that was [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=877.26s)]
*  anti-war, now libertarians are [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=879.02s)]
*  firmly anti-war, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=880.9s)]
*  they have joined the rebellion, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=881.9s)]
*  no question about it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=883.9399999999999s)]
*  Now, MAGA, half of MAGA is saying, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=885.9s)]
*  yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=888.46s)]
*  I don't even care what Donald Trump [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=890.5s)]
*  says. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=892.78s)]
*  No means no, we said no war, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=893.74s)]
*  this is definitely a war. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=895.38s)]
*  We don't need to get dragged into [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=897.34s)]
*  it, it doesn't need to be for [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=898.62s)]
*  regime change, it doesn't need to [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=899.5400000000001s)]
*  be to take out their nuclear [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=900.74s)]
*  facilities, it doesn't need to be [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=902.1s)]
*  for anything. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=903.5s)]
*  Maybe we should try America first [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=904.94s)]
*  instead of Israel first. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=906.98s)]
*  But I also want to mention Dave [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=908.7s)]
*  Smith, probably the leading [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=910.38s)]
*  libertarian in the country who [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=911.98s)]
*  flipped on Trump today, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=913.62s)]
*  he's going to be on the Young Turks [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=914.82s)]
*  tomorrow at 8 o'clock Eastern. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=916.4200000000001s)]
*  So don't miss that, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=918.4200000000001s)]
*  it's going to be an amazing [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=919.1s)]
*  interview. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ScOCNUTOc&t=920.02s)]
