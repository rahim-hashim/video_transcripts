"House Democratic leaders are ‚Äúpissed,‚Äù not necessarily at President Trump or the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, but at groups like MoveOn and Indivisible that are urging them to take a more confrontational approach to oppose the administration."*

The Young Turks are fearless in talking about the issues that matter. We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We cover politics, entertainment, sports, and pop culture; all through a progressive lens.

What does it mean to be a ‚ÄúYoung Turk?‚Äù

According to the American Heritage Dictionary;
1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 
2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations.

"Sharp-witted, persuasive, and inspiring, calling out toxic Republicans, politely-ineffectual Democrats, and mealy-mouthed media mavens in equal measure, JUSTICE IS COMING will give heart to Democrats and progressives who seek to change our politics and society for the better.

The media can‚Äôt stop talking about the gridlock in Washington, as if a handful of stubborn Republicans are the only thing standing between us and a fully-functional democracy. The reality is that our government has been taken over by big business and their allies in both political parties. The getaway driver in this heist was corporate media. The good news is that the American people are very progressive. And soon progressives will take over Washington as well! And when they do, the great majority of Americans will love it.

In JUSTICE IS COMING: How Progressives Are Going to Take Over the Country and America Is Going to Love It (On sale: September 19, 2023), The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur presents two ideas that counter everything we hear from pundits and politicians on a daily basis: one, progressives are correct on all issues, and two, America is actually a very progressive country. Millions of us know that we are a part of something larger, a movement that is already transforming Washington.

JUSTICE IS COMING, a compulsively readable manifesto, seeks to apply the momentum progressives have already built to a concrete progressive agenda that activists, voters, and citizens can all rally around. JUSTICE IS COMING looks beyond Trump to the larger historical forces that have given us this unique political moment, and explains why we should fight, how we should fight, and how we will win."

# These Two Companies Bought The Uniparty, and Now They're Coming To Rob You
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo)
*  I'm trying to figure out what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=0.0s)]
*  leverage we actually have. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=1.76s)]
*  What leverage do we have? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=3.84s)]
*  They control the House, the Senate, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=5.2s)]
*  and the presidency. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=7.76s)]
*  It's their government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  What leverage do we have? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=11.68s)]
*  While Democratic House minority [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=14.88s)]
*  leader Hakeem Jeffries makes clear [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=16.72s)]
*  that they don't really have a plan [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=18.72s)]
*  or strategy or intention on doing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=20.72s)]
*  anything on behalf of their [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=22.64s)]
*  Democratic base, he sure does seem [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=24.16s)]
*  to have a lot of time to raise [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=26.32s)]
*  millions of dollars in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=27.92s)]
*  questionable lobbying firms. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=29.68s)]
*  In fact, we're talking about [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  lobbying firms that work on behalf [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=34.8s)]
*  of companies like Planeteer. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=36.48s)]
*  Palantir. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=38.24s)]
*  Sorry, we both struggle with it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=39.76s)]
*  Palantir, I think. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=43.6s)]
*  I think it's Palantir. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=45.12s)]
*  Palantir, I think you're more [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=46.56s)]
*  right, my bad. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=48.08s)]
*  Okay, and SpaceX as well, which I [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=51.04s)]
*  don't know if you guys know this, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=52.8s)]
*  is one of Elon Musk's companies. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=54.4s)]
*  Now here's what you need to know [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  about it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=57.44s)]
*  So on January 22nd, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=58.0s)]
*  a lobbying firm called Invariant [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=59.72s)]
*  hosted a fundraiser that featured [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=62.16s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=64.72s)]
*  House Minority Leader or Speaker, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=66.16s)]
*  Democratic representatives Pete [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=68.64s)]
*  Aguilar and Suzanne Delbin. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=71.12s)]
*  Now the fundraiser was for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=73.8s)]
*  the Democratic Congressional [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=75.32s)]
*  Campaign Committee, which I'm sure [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=77.2s)]
*  many of you are already familiar [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=79.36s)]
*  with, it's the DCCC. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=81.12s)]
*  And the DCCC, for those who might [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=83.0s)]
*  not know, is responsible for [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=85.4s)]
*  the House Democrats campaign arm. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=87.8s)]
*  Now according to the Federal [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=91.4s)]
*  Commission filing that Sludge [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=93.2s)]
*  looked into, the DCCC raised over [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=95.04s)]
*  $2.5 million from Invariant in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=97.44s)]
*  the month of January, okay? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=99.84s)]
*  Now Invariant represents quite [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=102.48s)]
*  a few moneyed interests. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  So it had almost 200 clients last [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=107.16s)]
*  year and two of them happen to be [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=109.56s)]
*  Planeteer, Palantir, which is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=111.84s)]
*  actually Invariant's campaign arm. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=114.2s)]
*  So it's Invariant's top paying [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=117.2s)]
*  client and SpaceX. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=119.56s)]
*  So Palantir is an analytics company [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  and defense contractor that's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=123.44s)]
*  co-founded by Peter Thiel. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=125.8s)]
*  According to its websites, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=128.2s)]
*  its software can be used to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  automate operations from the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=131.76s)]
*  factory floor to the front lines, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=133.76s)]
*  achieve AI driven combat superiority [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  from space to mud, and autonomously [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=139.12s)]
*  deploy, monitor and manage software [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=141.92s)]
*  across the entire space, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=144.68s)]
*  and across any environment. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=146.52s)]
*  Now the company's software is also [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  used by private companies as well [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=150.68s)]
*  as state, local, and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  international governments. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=153.84s)]
*  Palantir paid Invariant $720,000 [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=155.56s)]
*  last year alone for lobbying on [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=158.52s)]
*  behalf of the corporation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  And Palantir has been considered [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=164.08s)]
*  one of the top stock picks of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=166.24s)]
*  the Doge era. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  As the company's artificial [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  intelligence powered software is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=171.28s)]
*  well positioned to win contracts to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=173.28s)]
*  the private sector, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=175.32s)]
*  it's a way to get the transactions [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=176.48s)]
*  eliminated by Doge's slashing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=178.52s)]
*  So lots of money making [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=180.52s)]
*  opportunities here for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=181.84s)]
*  private industry and it's tied to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=183.2s)]
*  the fact that the Trump [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=185.2s)]
*  administration with the help of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=186.6s)]
*  Elon Musk who of course has [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=188.48s)]
*  conflicts of interest is mass [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=190.04s)]
*  firing federal employees. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=191.8s)]
*  Now Invariant lobbied for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=193.44s)]
*  Palantir on potential contracts [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=195.04s)]
*  with agencies like the National [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  Institutes of Health, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=198.88s)]
*  the Department of Defense, and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=200.32s)]
*  the Internal Revenue Service. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=202.48s)]
*  Pause for a brief tangent because [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=204.84s)]
*  Cenk, this is the thing, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=207.24s)]
*  We know that money in politics [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=210.08s)]
*  leads to pork barrel spending on [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=212.08s)]
*  behalf of corporate interests and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  that infects pretty much every [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=216.38000000000002s)]
*  federal government agency. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=218.28s)]
*  So do I think that waste, fraud, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  and abuse exists? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=221.84s)]
*  I do, I do think it exists. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm in favor of slashing that waste [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=224.72000000000003s)]
*  fraud and abuse. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=226.56s)]
*  But we also have to acknowledge [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  the fact that the root of that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=229.52s)]
*  problem is the lobbying that is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=231.12s)]
*  allowed in this country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=232.96s)]
*  And the money that flows into [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=234.52s)]
*  the campaign coffers of politicians [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=236.12s)]
*  in both political parties. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=238.12s)]
*  That is the heart of the issue [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=241.24s)]
*  That is what leads to the waste, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=241.84s)]
*  fraud, and abuse. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=243.28s)]
*  That is what leads to the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  redistribution of wealth of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=245.68s)]

*  citizens up to the very top to all [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=249.88s)]
*  these corporate donors, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  corporate executives. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  You get the point. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=255.4s)]
*  Yeah, so this is one of Peter [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=256.64s)]
*  Teel's biggest companies and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=259.32s)]
*  one of his biggest bets. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=262.04s)]
*  And he's not a minor investor in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=265.32s)]
*  this, he's a founder of it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=266.76s)]
*  So there's a big difference there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=268.0s)]
*  And so he's a founder in another [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=269.8s)]
*  entity called JD Vance. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=273.32s)]
*  He totally bankrolled his Senate [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=276.72s)]
*  campaign when he started paying [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=278.92s)]
*  JD Vance through campaign [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=281.2s)]
*  contributions. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=282.92s)]
*  By the way, JD Vance used to work [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=284.12s)]
*  for one of his investment companies [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=285.96s)]
*  as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=288.08s)]
*  So he's owned him, I mean, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=288.64s)]
*  been friends and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=289.96s)]
*  colleagues for a long time. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=290.74s)]
*  Then he gave him about 10 to 15 [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=292.64s)]
*  million dollars before he gave him [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  that JD Vance didn't even register. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=296.16s)]
*  Afterwards, he started climbing up [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  the ranks, came into second place [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  in that race, and then eventually [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=302.92s)]
*  got put over the top by the entire [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=305.0s)]
*  Trump ecosystem, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=307.08s)]
*  So Palantir has a lot of contracts [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  with the Pentagon, and by the way, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=312.8s)]
*  also kind of could be critical in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=316.04s)]
*  spying in on us. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=319.0s)]
*  So a lot of high tech, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=320.92s)]
*  intelligence work as well from what [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=323.4s)]
*  I've read in the past about them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=326.2s)]
*  And then you've got SpaceX, and so [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=329.56s)]
*  that's obviously Elon Musk. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=332.44s)]
*  So these are the new tech donor [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  class, and they've decided we can [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=337.4s)]
*  buy this government. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=340.4s)]
*  If Soros could buy it, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=342.56s)]
*  if all the other donors in the past [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=343.68s)]
*  could buy it, the oil companies and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=345.24s)]
*  the banks and APAC and all these [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=346.84s)]
*  other lobbies can buy it, wait a [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=348.24s)]
*  minute, we're richer than them. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  Why can't we buy it? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=351.52s)]
*  And to me, there was already a five [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=352.88s)]
*  alarm fire when I read the Hegseth [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=354.84s)]
*  plan on the Pentagon, how he was [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=356.84s)]
*  going to cut $50 billion a year, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  just kidding, not cut it, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=360.76s)]
*  but redirect it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=362.4s)]
*  To AI? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so let's all see it with our [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=364.35999999999996s)]
*  own eyes, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=366.79999999999995s)]
*  We're all going to watch it [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=369.64s)]
*  together. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  Doesn't matter if you're right wing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=371.24s)]
*  and skeptical and say, no, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  our donors are lovely. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=374.24s)]
*  And don't worry, your donors right [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=375.64s)]
*  now are also Democratic donors. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=377.24s)]
*  So the unit party's back, baby, and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=379.12s)]
*  they've just coalesced around [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=381.16s)]
*  a new donor class. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=382.68s)]
*  But if you don't believe it, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=383.92s)]
*  let's see what they redirect [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  the Pentagon spending to. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=386.64s)]
*  My guess is there'll be a lot of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=388.36s)]
*  Palantir in there and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=389.92s)]
*  some SpaceX in there. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=390.92s)]
*  And my further guess is that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  the Democrats won't object. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=394.04s)]
*  Why? They just got bribed [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=396.08s)]
*  not to object. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=397.72s)]
*  Bingo, bingo. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=398.64s)]
*  So look, right now there is a bill [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=400.24s)]
*  in the House of Representatives, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=403.72s)]
*  the budget bill, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=407.08s)]
*  that rhetorically speaking, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=408.64s)]
*  Democrats are going to push back [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=410.72s)]
*  on. But when push comes to shove, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=412.32000000000005s)]
*  do they really hate that budget [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  bill? Sure, I'm sure a handful of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=415.44000000000005s)]
*  those Democrats do hate that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=417.16s)]
*  budget bill. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=418.6s)]
*  But make no mistake about it, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=419.88000000000005s)]
*  they usually don't fight back [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=421.76000000000005s)]
*  aggressively or at all when it [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=423.6s)]
*  comes to cuts to things like [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=425.48s)]
*  Medicare, Medicaid, things like [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=427.24s)]
*  that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=429.44000000000005s)]
*  In fact, James Carville just wrote [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  an absolutely abhorrent piece in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=432.64000000000004s)]

*  Medicaid. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=443.0s)]
*  And then the competent Democratic [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=444.0s)]
*  party will come in and save the day [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=446.44s)]
*  once the American people see just [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=448.84s)]
*  how bad the Republicans are. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=451.24s)]
*  Yeah, but James, you're missing [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=453.56s)]
*  something critical there. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=454.96s)]
*  They're not competent. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's also true, but [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  even bigger part. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  That means Medicaid is already [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=462.32s)]
*  destroyed. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=463.96s)]
*  So then you're coming to take [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=464.88s)]
*  advantage of that situation for [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=466.76s)]
*  the power and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=469.0s)]
*  ego of Democratic politicians. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=469.8s)]
*  I'm not at all interested in that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=472.28s)]
*  I'm interested in stopping them [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=474.08s)]
*  from destroying Medicaid. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=476.2s)]
*  So like James Carville's like, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=478.2s)]
*  I came up with a great plan to make [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=480.24s)]
*  our careers better. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=482.4s)]
*  Wow, thanks a lot. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=484.52s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=485.96s)]
*  Could you come up with a plan to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=487.32s)]
*  make your voters lives better? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=488.84s)]
*  Could we do that for [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=490.68s)]
*  once in our lives? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=491.52s)]
*  And Carville's a guy we've agreed [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=492.48s)]
*  with a lot lately as he's [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=494.12s)]
*  criticized Democratic Party, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=495.32s)]
*  Biden and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=497.04s)]
*  Harrison how they ran their [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=497.52s)]
*  campaign. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=498.96s)]
*  But he's from the old school. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=500.03999999999996s)]
*  And unfortunately for [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  the last 40 years, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=503.56s)]
*  the Democratic Party hasn't been [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=504.91999999999996s)]
*  trying to help their voters at all. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=507.12s)]
*  It's time to wake up and see [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  the Democratic Party for what it is. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=511.56s)]

*  the party of FDR, those days are [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=515.72s)]
*  over, okay? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=518.1999999999999s)]
*  And the reason why those days are [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=519.56s)]
*  over is because their campaign [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=521.28s)]
*  coffers are stuffed with the same [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=522.96s)]
*  corporate cash that Republican [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=524.84s)]

*  if you don't believe me, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMmx3dyGPo&t=529.76s)]
