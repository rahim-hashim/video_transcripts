# Jesse Watters LOSES IT On CNN
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw)
*  One thing America can make, it's a bomb. Ask the Japanese, ask the Germans. I've never [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=0.0s)]
*  heard of an American bomb not working, have you? Everybody says direct hit, years to come [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=6.66s)]
*  back from it. And then there's CNN alone in the corner in last place, spewing enemy propaganda. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=12.58s)]
*  I don't think they can come back from this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=18.32s)]
*  Entertainment host Fox News' Jesse Waters, furious over CNN's recent reporting that stated [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=21.2s)]
*  the strikes on Iran only set back its nuclear program by a couple of months. Clearly Trump [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=26.96s)]
*  is God, what he says goes. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=31.96s)]
*  And the United States is the most technologically advanced country that gets everything right, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=34.72s)]
*  never manages a mistake. Cenk, we're gonna throw to you in a second, but first, let's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=39.68s)]
*  get more details, what Jesse Waters had to say about the strike, because the level of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  delulu, I'll say, is insane for this one. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  Jesse, it almost seems like CNN and the New York Times are using this leaked report, whatever [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=53.959999999999994s)]
*  it is, to cheer triumphantly that perhaps the the Bunker Buster bomber strike wasn't [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  quite as effective as the administration is claiming. What do you make of that? And will [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=66.88s)]
*  the president get credit if he did, in fact, dismantle Iran's nuclear program? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=71.44s)]
*  Of course, if there's one thing America can make, it's a bomb. If this didn't work and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=75.96s)]
*  it was a dud, Netanyahu would have been on the phone with Trump saying, let's do another [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  run. If it didn't work, the Iranians wouldn't have had a ceasefire. This was such a precise [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=85.28s)]
*  strike. They put these bombs down the mountain's ventilation shaft. Okay, this didn't have [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=92.28s)]
*  to explode and bore into the mountain. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=99.76s)]
*  They put these things untouched and it slid down the ventilation shaft and exploded in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  the main hall and then collapsed the roof of the cavern and caused a fire. You could [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=109.88s)]
*  even see the discoloration at the top of the mountain. This wasn't like carpet bombing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=116.0s)]
*  the North Vietnamese jungles. This was as precise a strike as you can get. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=120.36s)]
*  Cenk, I guess I don't understand why this was so important to the administration and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=125.96s)]
*  the man who leads it, President Trump. I mean, if they set him back a couple of months, wouldn't [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=131.76s)]
*  that be a success then get a ceasefire? I just don't understand why Jesse Waters has [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=136.84s)]
*  to carry the water for the president in this way. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=141.72s)]
*  A strike is a strike and things didn't go well. Do we have to debate the level to which [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=144.28s)]
*  they didn't go well? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=150.02s)]
*  Well, so there's a hilarious lie in there that we're gonna show you in a little bit [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=151.24s)]
*  from Jesse Waters. He actually contradicts himself. I love it. But first, to Sharon's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=155.28s)]
*  point, one of the things I want to discuss here is, look, I think that that was cherry [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=162.32s)]
*  picked intelligence and I'm glad that they're not listening to it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=166.68s)]
*  So I agree with the result of what Donald Trump and Jesse Waters want, which is let's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=170.76s)]
*  not bomb Iran anymore. The bombing worked well enough. Let's get out of there, okay? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=175.48s)]
*  But why do you have to attack CNN and New York Times and threaten to sue them or get [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=180.88s)]
*  the reporters fired? That's not necessary at all. You just say it's cherry picked intelligence. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=186.52s)]
*  What's wrong and you move on. But nope, nope, they always have to take it over the top. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=191.96s)]
*  They always have to try to get everybody fired and canceled and no one's allowed to criticize [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=197.24s)]
*  the president. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=202.52s)]
*  No one's allowed to dispute the president. Do we live in a democracy or don't we? Do [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=203.52s)]
*  you believe in freedom of speech or not? New York Times and CNN say it. So what? Say something [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  back, right? Instead of demanding that no one be allowed to say it. They're hilariously [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=212.28s)]
*  hypocritical on free speech. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=219.44s)]
*  But let me let you finish the rest of the story then I want to come back to the lie [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=221.76s)]
*  too. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=224.24s)]
*  Yeah, hypocritical somewhat. Well, dictatorship is what comes to mind, evidence of that. So [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=225.24s)]
*  let's get into it. CNN, the New York Times, according to the Times, the report by the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=233.24s)]
*  Defense Intelligence Agency focused largely on the state of the Porto plant, country's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=236.96s)]
*  deeply buried rather enrichment facility which produced the near bomb grade fuel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=242.6s)]
*  Multiple officials familiar with the intelligence report that spoke to both the Times and CNN [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  said early findings showed this. The strikes had set back Iran's nuclear program by months. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=254.0s)]
*  Officials said the strikes sealed off entrances to the facility but had not led to a collapse [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=261.0s)]
*  even open the possibility that Iran could eventually dig it out. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=267.8s)]
*  New York Times, CNN's report also stated this. Analysis of the damage to the sites and the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=271.76000000000005s)]
*  impact of the strikes on Iran's nuclear ambitions is ongoing. Could change as more intelligence [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=277.64000000000004s)]
*  becomes available but the early findings are at odds with President Donald Trump's repeated [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  claims that the strikes completely and totally obliterated Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  But ah-ha, Jesse Waters arguing that this reporting is just enemy propaganda trying [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=295.68s)]
*  to discredit Trump. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=301.2s)]
*  The woman is the same reporter who said the laptop was Russia and now she says our bombs [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  don't work. You'd think she would have been fired for getting hoodwinked by the deep state [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=308.68s)]
*  a couple years ago, but she actually got promoted. She got promoted for being wrong. She got [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=315.67999999999995s)]
*  a raise for being wrong. Now she's on CNN getting hoodwinked all over again because [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=322.28s)]
*  that's the point. She's not there to be right. She's just there to hurt Donald Trump. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  All right, so as we reported yesterday, Donald Trump went on a Trump social bender, if you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=331.0s)]
*  will, stating fake news. CNN is so disgusting and incompetent. And of course, what does [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=335.88s)]
*  Trump do when hit with critical reporting about him? Well, Cenk talked about it. He [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=341.88s)]
*  threatens to sue this, according to the New York Times. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=346.4s)]
*  In a letter to the Times, a personal lawyer for the president said the newspaper's article [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  had damaged Mr. Trump's reputation and demanded that the news organization retract and apologize [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=356.0s)]
*  for the piece, which the letter described as false, defamatory, and unpatriotic. So [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=361.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't, you know, maybe you can sue for that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=367.88s)]
*  CNN also confirmed they received a similar threat. The letter from Trump's lawyer, Alejandro [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=371.36s)]
*  Britto, described the attack on Iran as a, quote, historic and resounding military success [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=376.92s)]
*  that unequivocally eliminated Iran's nuclear capabilities and brought peace to the region, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=382.88s)]
*  echoing the president's own characterizations of the operation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=389.36s)]
*  Mr. Britto asserted that the Times article about the preliminary intelligence assessment, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  quote, undermined the credibility and integrity of President Trump in the eyes of the public [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=398.12s)]
*  and the professional community. But again, the Times noted the preliminary nature of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=402.92s)]
*  the report. So they're covered there. The Times, in a response on Thursday, rejected [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump's demands, noting that Trump administration officials had subsequently confirmed the existence [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  of the report issued by the Defense Intelligence Agency and its findings. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  No retraction is needed. No apology will be forthcoming. We told the truth to the best [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=426.56s)]
*  of our ability. We will continue to do so. The Times lawyer pushing back. And look, let's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=433.32s)]
*  hope that they continue to push back, Cenk and Woz. But I don't know. It seems that the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=443.28s)]
*  more of this frivolous nonsense, this babbling from the administration, legal, fictitious [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=448.76s)]
*  renderings go out, more and more news organizations could cave. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=454.24s)]
*  Not necessarily the newspaper strength, but we've seen it with multiple networks caving [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=459.44s)]
*  and giving ridiculous settlements. What do you think happens here? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=463.8s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately, as predicted now, other politicians are doing it like Gavin Newsom. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=467.68s)]
*  I want to get back to that too, but I want to let Woz weigh in first. What do you think, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=472.32s)]
*  Woz? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=476.91999999999996s)]
*  The Trump regime only knows one gear, and that's the maximalist response to any and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=478.24s)]
*  all opposition. However, as wrongheaded as I think this like litigious aspect of their [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=486.56s)]
*  responses, I think they're responding to something real, which is that these deep state people, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=494.64s)]
*  these warmongering, neocon people, they're leaking these reports because they want to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=501.76s)]
*  go back in. It's just the truth. When are they ever leaking reports like, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=507.52s)]
*  the military didn't really do a good enough job? That's not a thing. That's not something [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=513.12s)]
*  you're gonna get three days after something happened. They're doing it because it's like, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=517.52s)]
*  no, we need to escalate even further. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=522.72s)]
*  And I think the Trump administration, to their credit, rightfully understand that an escalation [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=526.48s)]
*  would inevitably lead to all out war. Iran's response by hitting our bases, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=532.96s)]
*  telling us ahead of time to do as little impact as possible, even though we're told constantly [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=539.36s)]
*  that the Iranians are part of a death cult who want to just kill everybody. And so it was able [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=544.48s)]
*  to give Trump and them a win to be like, all right, we did it, we're wiping our hands, we're done. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=551.28s)]
*  They're leaking this into New York Times and say, no, we need to go do more, which is then [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=556.32s)]
*  going to mean what? The Iranians didn't have to react in kind. And then when they do actually [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=561.04s)]
*  strike us for real, hit our military personnel, not the freaking Israelis, our military personnel [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=567.68s)]
*  in the region, then we have to escalate even further. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=575.68s)]
*  And that escalation leads to this and then inevitably means boots on the ground [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=579.12s)]
*  and freaking Iran. That's why they're doing this in the New York Times and in CNN. Yes, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=583.76s)]
*  Trump's response is ridiculous cuz he doesn't know any other gears. He doesn't know how to modulate. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=589.12s)]
*  But I think their instinct here is the right one. The reason why they're criticizing a military [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=595.6s)]
*  action. Think about that. When do the Times and CNN criticize military actions abroad? Never. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=602.4s)]
*  They're only doing it because they want to do more. And so as nasty and stupid as the responses [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=609.68s)]
*  from the Trump people, I think they have a point here. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=616.8s)]
*  Yeah, so I totally agree with Was, but they could have just said it like Was. And like we said [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=620.0s)]
*  yesterday on the show with, look, you could create evidence on both sides. And in fact, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=626.8s)]
*  our intelligence should create evidence on both sides. Hey, here's a report saying that we think [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  we might have done enough damage. Here's a report saying we think we might not have done enough [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  damage. And we're not sure, and that's why we have these two different reports. But you don't see both [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=639.52s)]
*  reports. One of them gets picked up by someone who wants to create more war leaked to the New [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=643.6s)]
*  York Times and CNN. And New York Times and CNN don't give you any context into, this is a [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=648.08s)]
*  warmonger giving me this leak to create more war. They just say it like, that's it, it's definitive, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=652.72s)]
*  right? And to be fair to the New York Times, they didn't say that it was definitive. But [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=657.84s)]
*  it leaves that impression. And they're great at leaving that impression about how we need to go [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=661.52s)]
*  to more war just look at what they did during the Iraq war. Having said that, there's no reason to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  say that the New York Times is unpatriotic. Reporters don't have to be patriotic. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=670.48s)]
*  They just have to be accurate, right? There's no need to say that our own intelligence, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=674.72s)]
*  even if it's cherry picked, is enemy propaganda or reports about it. So yeah, the fact that they [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=680.96s)]
*  can't modulate discredits them and is problematic, especially in a situation like this, where they're [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=686.4s)]
*  generally speaking largely right about not escalating the war and not using cherry-picked [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=691.6800000000001s)]
*  intelligence to escalate it. Last thing, two things I wanna get to is the stuff I promised you [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=697.2s)]
*  guys. So now Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News for some edit they did and Jesse Waters said something [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=701.9200000000001s)]
*  about a call between him and Trump. Honestly, the rest of the story is totally uninteresting. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=708.32s)]
*  He's doing it for media attention, but he's also doing it a little bit like Trump to intimidate [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=712.6400000000001s)]
*  the press. You better not write anything or say anything negative about me. So this is another [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=716.96s)]
*  giant problem with how Trump goes about this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  Because when you start having politicians threatening to sue anyone who criticizes them, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=724.08s)]
*  as we told you when Trump first started doing it, now all politicians will say, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=729.52s)]
*  that's it, you can't criticize me at all. I'm suing everyone, and that's a giant problem. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=734.0s)]
*  And finally, we get to the funny part. So Donald Trump was very clear. He said [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=738.5600000000001s)]
*  that the intelligence was very inconclusive. The intelligence says we don't know, which is [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=745.04s)]
*  what I told you a minute ago. Now Jesse Waters partly agrees, but then partly tells us he knows [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=752.3199999999999s)]
*  exactly what happened. Let's watch. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=758.56s)]
*  Do you think they're getting it from some sort of nefarious Iranian sources and- [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=760.8s)]
*  No, some hater in the Pentagon leaked an early report that had no confidence and just relied on [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=765.04s)]
*  some camera up in the sky. That's it. It's not like there's some Israeli spy down there in the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=771.28s)]
*  rubble with a phone. Yep, we killed this thing. Can you guys send some food? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=776.8s)]
*  You're never gonna know what happened because the thing is a pile of rubble. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  This was such a precise strike. They put these bombs down the mountain's ventilation shaft. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=789.28s)]
*  They put these things untouched and it slid down the ventilation shaft and exploded in the main [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=797.0400000000001s)]
*  hall and then collapsed the roof of the cavern and caused a fire. You could even see the discoloration [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  at the top of the mountain. They compared the target to something the size of a refrigerator. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=812.0s)]
*  This was as precise a strike as you can get. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=817.5200000000001s)]
*  Is that amazing? That was in the same segment. He said there's no way of knowing what happened [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=821.04s)]
*  with the bomb. Let me tell you exactly what happened with the bomb. It slid down the tunnel [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=826.7199999999999s)]
*  shaft and it got there past Mohammed and then saw a sandwich that was left by. It turns out it was [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=831.6s)]
*  a falafel sandwich, but there's no way of knowing what happened. But then, come on, Jesse, come on. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=837.36s)]
*  If you're gonna lie, at least give it a little bit of space between the two lies. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=843.52s)]
*  So this terrible story with an amusing ending. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=848.08s)]
*  If he's that good though, he's gotta get off the air at Fox News immediately and join the CIA. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=851.2800000000001s)]
*  They need him in the intelligence. If he knows it went down that ventilation chute and all of that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=857.2s)]
*  stuff, it's incredible, okay? He's either a genius or a fascinating storyteller, okay? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=863.12s)]
*  Either way, he's the best. He's the best. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=868.88s)]
*  And by the way, they dropped it from 13,000 feet, but it didn't explode. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=871.0400000000001s)]
*  It slid down the tunnel shaft and then exploded later. Likely story. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=875.44s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=880.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=880.72s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=881.22s)]
*  Award. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=882.72s)]
*  Jesus, man. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJQvmtprAcw&t=883.22s)]
