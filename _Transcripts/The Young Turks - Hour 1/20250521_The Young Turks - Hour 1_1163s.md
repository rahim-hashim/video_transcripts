TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.

The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.

On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.

Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.

Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.

TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

TYT includes owned and operated and partner shows such as The Young Turks, The Damage Report, Indisputable, and more.

TYT‚Äôs 24/7 programming is available on YouTube TV, Samsung TV, Plus, Roku, Xumo, TCLtv+, Fubo, and more.

# The View Hosts RAGE At Book Exposing Biden Cover-Up
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g)
*  When is Jake Tapper gonna write a book about the cognitive decline of the person who is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=0.0s)]
*  in charge right now? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=5.3s)]
*  I don't think there is anyone who could credibly accuse especially Jake Tapper of not critically [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=6.8s)]
*  covering Donald Trump for the last ten years. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Why is this important to know now? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=14.32s)]
*  This is where I take issue with some folks on the left. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=16.04s)]
*  We stand with journalists, we stand with the free press when they're going after their [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=19.02s)]
*  opponents like Donald Trump. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=22.68s)]
*  Well, Alyssa Farah Griffin on The View was the only lady on that panel who was willing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  to call out the Democrats or liberals in the media who are in fact hypocrites on this issue. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=31.28s)]
*  They love to support journalists unless the journalists are providing some constructive [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=38.6s)]
*  feedback in regard to how the American people are feeling about the Democratic Party. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=43.2s)]
*  And how they were feeling about Biden's very obvious mental decline. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  Remember, poll after poll leading up to the 2024 presidential election indicated that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=53.4s)]
*  the majority of voters, including the majority of Democratic voters, were worried about Biden's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=58.48s)]
*  age. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=64.24s)]
*  But the party ignored those polls and moved forward with Biden anyway, and they paid a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=65.44s)]
*  price for that, Jake. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=70.36s)]
*  Yeah, so they don't really want journalism. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=71.88s)]
*  They like journalists when journalists were providing cover for establishment politicians. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=74.74s)]
*  They want propaganda. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=79.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=80.4s)]
*  They stop doing any kind of propaganda, even in hindsight, they're like not good enough [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=81.4s)]
*  because we don't want journalism, we want propaganda. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  And so that's why they're mad at Jake Tapper. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Now before they loved Jake Tapper, when Jake Tapper was looking down his nose at anyone [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=91.76s)]
*  who suggested Biden was too old, The View loved him and they're like what a great journalist. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=95.72s)]
*  But now that he's actually reporting things that are true, they're like, yuck, things [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=101.0s)]
*  that are true. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=104.68s)]
*  No, no, no, we don't like those kind of journalists. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=105.68s)]
*  And so, but I do want to answer Whoopi's question. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=108.64s)]
*  She said, why do we need to know this now? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  And that's actually the question I'm getting most often from the Rad Libs. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=113.0s)]
*  And look, guys, I've been saying this now for a bunch of weeks here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=116.52s)]
*  I now realize that maybe the most radical contingent within the Democratic Party are [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=122.28s)]
*  the Rad Libs, the former moderates, who are like the blue MAGA, blue Anon, etc. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=128.44s)]
*  And so they're like, why you stop talking about Biden? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=134.16s)]
*  You're trying to help Trump. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=136.88s)]
*  Wait, we said Biden shouldn't run because it would help Trump. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=139.68s)]
*  We were right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=143.72s)]
*  So how does, what? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=145.6s)]
*  It doesn't, it's like sometimes they struggle with English language. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=147.16s)]
*  So but in this case, for both them and Whoopi, why is it important that we're talking about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=150.48s)]
*  it now? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=155.48s)]
*  So we don't make the same mistake again. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=156.48s)]
*  Because the next time they're going to tell you don't trust your lying eyes, don't trust [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=160.64s)]
*  your ears, and don't worry. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=164.72s)]
*  We know, Whoopi knows, the view knows that the corporate Democrat is the one you have [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=166.55999999999997s)]
*  to back. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  The corporate Democrat is the one that's going to win, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  Populist, no, populists can't win. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=177.2s)]
*  And they'll see it with a straight face. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=180.04s)]
*  So I mean, you're saying with a straight face now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=181.72s)]
*  They are. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  So wait for an incredibly illuminating video featuring one of the authors of Original Sin, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  reporter Alex Thompson. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  He says something pretty devastating about the media and what they're willing to believe. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  So stick around for that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=199.44s)]
*  But before we do get to that clip, the ladies of the view are absolutely losing it over [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=200.44s)]
*  the revelations that are coming out as a result of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's new book [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=205.44s)]
*  on Biden and his mental decline titled Original Sin. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  I want to show you the first clip. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  If you're telling me that hundreds of people knew that he was not able to do his job, then [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  where the hell was everybody? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=224.36s)]
*  Jake is my former colleague. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  I know him well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=228.4s)]
*  He's a friend. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=229.4s)]
*  He's a terrific journalist. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=230.4s)]
*  He said that 99% of what is reported in the book was discovered after the election. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=231.4s)]
*  So I think we can put that part to bed about journalists holding on information until so [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=236.88s)]
*  that they could make money off their book. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=242.84s)]
*  What I do think that we should be very, very concerned about are the people that were in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=244.4s)]
*  the Trump administration that did hold on to information about how Trump was conducting [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  the presidency so that they could make money off of their book. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=253.88s)]
*  We're talking about former National Security Advisor John Bolton who came on this show [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=257.32s)]
*  hawking his book. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=261.72s)]
*  And I told him, why didn't you say something before? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=262.72s)]
*  Former Attorney General Bill Barr, he wrote a book, didn't say anything while he was in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=265.08s)]
*  there. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=269.08s)]
*  And that White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=270.08s)]
*  Those people did get criticized for holding on to information that they knew while they [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=279.08s)]
*  were in the Trump administration so they could profit off of it in their books later. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=284.56s)]
*  But that happened years ago. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=289.24s)]
*  We're now talking about what recently happened with a major cover up involving the President [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=291.12s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=297.28s)]
*  Okay? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  That mental decline and the fact that anyone who called out that or shared any concern [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=300.04s)]
*  about that mental decline was totally dogpiled. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=309.44s)]
*  Totally made out to be an evil, ageist, a bad person, including by Jake Tapper. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=310.44s)]
*  But anyway. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=316.76s)]
*  Yeah, so look, they have binary brain. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=317.76s)]
*  So they think if you're criticizing Biden for his mental decline, that must mean that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=320.88s)]
*  you love Trump and you would not call out Trump. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=326.0s)]
*  No, you can call out Trump and Biden. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=329.48s)]
*  That would be called journalism. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=333.12s)]
*  And I know that that's like a weird concept to you, especially Sonny Houston. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=335.44s)]
*  I mean, she's the worst of the worst. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=338.76s)]
*  Yeah, she's in the vault. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=341.12s)]
*  Was Bill Barr calling out Trump? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, first of all, Bill Barr was terrible attorney general and authoritarian in every [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=344.32s)]
*  way. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=348.88s)]
*  But when Trump said we should steal the election and you should declare fraud, Bill Barr as [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=349.88s)]
*  attorney general said no, there was no fraud in election. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=355.96s)]
*  I mean, that's when the chips were down and things matter the most. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=359.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=363.92s)]
*  And he made his one great decision. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=364.92s)]
*  Everything else in his life is super questionable. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=367.08s)]
*  But he did the right thing at the right time. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=369.52s)]
*  Did anyone in the Biden administration say, wait a minute, guys, he's obviously in mental [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=372.8s)]
*  decline. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I've got to do what's right for the country and not what's right for our careers. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  Zero. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=382.0s)]
*  Obviously, no one in the Biden administration did that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=383.0s)]
*  So that when you're losing to Bill Barr on principles and on doing the right thing, you're [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=386.0s)]
*  at rock bottom, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=390.96s)]
*  And you're like this whole like, my God, Biden was great. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=393.36s)]
*  Why is everybody criticizing him? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=397.96s)]
*  I loathe it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=399.36s)]
*  So I got to talk about two other things they just said. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=400.52s)]
*  Whoopi had the nerve to say, where the hell were they during the Biden administration? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=402.84s)]
*  We were right here. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=408.72s)]
*  And you know who said that we were not allowed on air anywhere on cable news or television? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=410.0s)]
*  You guys, you guys. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=415.6s)]
*  If I said, hey, can I come on the view to talk about how Biden's too old? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  There's no way you would have allowed anyone on the view to say that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=421.92s)]
*  No way. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=425.76000000000005s)]
*  You guys are propaganda central, propaganda headquarters. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=427.32000000000005s)]
*  It's because of you that we couldn't get the message out. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  It's because of cable news that we couldn't get the message out. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  Anytime somebody said that Biden was too old, Jake Tapper would look down his nose [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=436.36s)]
*  and how dare you, sounds conspiratorial. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=440.16s)]
*  Okay, now Alex Thompson was better. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=445.8s)]
*  He's his co-author. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=447.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=448.68s)]
*  And Alex Thompson did actually every once in a while change a little bit. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=449.68s)]
*  But then I was really disappointed. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=451.88s)]
*  I hope Sonny Halston is lying as usual. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=453.0s)]
*  Because if it's true that now he's saying, we found out all the 99% of the evidence after [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=455.64s)]
*  the election. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=460.92s)]
*  No, then I'm gonna take away all your credit. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=461.92s)]
*  I don't. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=464.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=465.12s)]
*  That's insanity. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=466.12s)]
*  Then how did I know? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=467.12s)]
*  Am I a genius? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=468.12s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=469.12s)]
*  I would take anything Sonny Halston says with a grain of salt. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=470.4s)]
*  She's already proven herself to be so biased that she's willing to say the most ludicrous [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=474.04s)]
*  things including pivoting toward the Trump administration's first term to avoid talking [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=478.68s)]
*  about the very real failures of the Biden administration and the Democratic Party as [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=486.02s)]
*  it pertains to this cover up. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=492.1s)]
*  Now I wanna get to what Alex Thompson had to say in a recent interview with Leland [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=493.68s)]
*  Vitter on News Nation. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=498.68s)]
*  They were talking about the book. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=500.8s)]
*  And I think what he says about the media here is enlightening. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=502.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=506.0s)]
*  When you were reporting this, did people in his inner circle, did those that you talked [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=507.0s)]
*  to acknowledge that the media, were they surprised by how complicit the media was? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=512.28s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=517.44s)]
*  I had one conversation with someone. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=518.44s)]
*  This was after the election while we were reporting this book. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=519.82s)]
*  And this person said, listen, yes, we deserve blame for X, Y, Z. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  We were hiding them. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=529.82s)]
*  But this person also sort of got in my face and they said, listen, the media deserves [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=531.4200000000001s)]
*  some blame too. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=535.6600000000001s)]
*  We were sort of amazed at some of the stuff we were able to spin orders on. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=538.2600000000001s)]
*  And get away with? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=542.94s)]
*  Is it like the bank robber complaining that Safe wasn't locked or something? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=543.94s)]
*  They're just like, you guys should not have believed us so easily. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=547.62s)]
*  And I thought that was a really interesting, but I also think that's true. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=551.54s)]
*  I think the media, in a lot of ways, just was not skeptical enough and did not remember [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=554.6999999999999s)]
*  the lesson that they do it to different degrees, but every White House lies. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=562.18s)]
*  If a politician is talking and you're the journalist hearing what they're saying, you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=568.06s)]
*  should automatically assume. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=574.5799999999999s)]
*  The automatic assumption should be that they are lying. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=576.4599999999999s)]
*  So you have to fact check what they're saying. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=580.9399999999999s)]
*  You have to dig in, you have to investigate. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=583.86s)]
*  But look, when you hear right wingers argue that the legacy media or mainstream media [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=585.86s)]
*  has a liberal bias, this is what they're talking about. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=592.06s)]
*  This is what they're talking about. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=595.5799999999999s)]
*  Because the media, I think most people employed in these places, on these platforms, and in [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=597.14s)]
*  these papers, do seem to lean more toward the Democratic Party. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=602.5799999999999s)]
*  No, I actually disagree with that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=608.5799999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=610.06s)]
*  Yeah, and I'll tell you why. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=611.06s)]
*  So I understand what you're saying. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=612.06s)]
*  So no question on social issues, they're more on the left, they're more Democrats. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=613.18s)]
*  100%, yes. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=616.9s)]
*  Yes, so I acknowledge that 100%. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=617.9s)]
*  But when you're talking about the core issues that we care about, economic issues. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=621.3s)]
*  That's different. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=625.0999999999999s)]
*  They're not liberal at all. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=626.0999999999999s)]
*  What they are is they have a massive pro-establishment bias. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=628.18s)]
*  So if Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden do a crooked deal where they make the Bush tax cuts permanent [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=631.9399999999999s)]
*  for the rich, the media loves that. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=636.4599999999999s)]
*  And I know I covered it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=639.98s)]
*  I've been here for over 20 years now. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=641.06s)]
*  I've covered all of these. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=643.54s)]
*  When Mitch McConnell broke the record on filibusters and changed how filibusters were done, from [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=645.18s)]
*  like a rare exception to we vote down anything that helps the American people, the mainstream [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=650.8199999999999s)]
*  media loved it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=655.86s)]
*  And they ran cover for him and they pretended that that's what they always do with the filibuster. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=657.3s)]
*  Every dirty corporate deal that the Republicans and the Democrats have done together, the [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=661.66s)]
*  mainstream media was like, bravo, bipartisanship, corporate rule is the greatest thing on earth. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=666.94s)]
*  That ain't liberal, that ain't progressive, that ain't left. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=672.54s)]
*  That is hardcore corporatist. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=675.1s)]
*  Okay, and normally in the old days, I would have called it right wing. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=676.9s)]
*  But I'm not even sure it's right wing anymore. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=680.0600000000001s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=681.82s)]
*  That part of it isn't really partisan. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=682.82s)]
*  It's just pro-corporate. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=685.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=686.26s)]
*  So and then, to your point, Ana, about you assume that they're lying. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=687.3s)]
*  Guys, here's what we mean by that. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=691.58s)]
*  If a politician says something, you shouldn't print the opposite because you assume they [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=694.42s)]
*  were lying. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=697.1s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=698.1s)]
*  You have to fact check. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=699.1s)]
*  Yeah, and what it is is a rebuttable presumption, right? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=700.1s)]
*  This is a concept that exists in law. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=702.38s)]
*  So in some cases, that your presumption should be, this guy is in it for himself and he's [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=704.78s)]
*  doing it because of his own personal interest. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=710.58s)]
*  For a politician, that is an excellent assumption, but it can be rebutted. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=713.38s)]
*  If you found out, hey, no, turns out Bernie's not in it for himself. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=718.5s)]
*  He turned down corporate PAC money and he actually proposed bills that are for the average [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=722.1800000000001s)]
*  guy. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=725.6600000000001s)]
*  Okay, the presumption has been rebutted. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=726.6600000000001s)]
*  But if your rebuttable presumption is the politician is awesome and wonderful and honorable [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=727.82s)]
*  and honest, you're a bit of a moron. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=734.02s)]
*  And you shouldn't be in news at all, at all. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=737.82s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, 100% in your face. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=740.5s)]
*  And that guy who, according to Alex Thompson there, was making basically saying, hey, you [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=743.1s)]
*  guys let us get away with it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=747.9s)]
*  That is the most true thing I have ever heard from anyone in government. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=749.5400000000001s)]
*  And they all laughed their ass off at these losers in mainstream media. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=753.0600000000001s)]
*  They're like, watch, watch, we'll tell them anything. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=756.94s)]
*  We'll tell them that Israel has the most moral army on earth. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=759.02s)]
*  I bet they all repeated like morons. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=761.98s)]
*  And then they are like, Israel has the most moral army. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=764.62s)]
*  They just slaughtered 16,000 children, but they have the most moral army human shields [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=767.62s)]
*  on Mars. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=771.3000000000001s)]
*  You could tell them, hey, you know what, if you don't negotiate drug prices, that's great [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=772.4599999999999s)]
*  capitalism. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=775.9399999999999s)]
*  No, that's the opposite of capitalism, right? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=776.9399999999999s)]
*  No, we will report it as great capitalism. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=779.3399999999999s)]
*  And if you're against that, you're a radical. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=781.9s)]
*  Come on, guys, you're in the propaganda business. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=784.8199999999999s)]
*  You just don't know it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=787.02s)]
*  So will they ever learn anything from any of this? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=789.26s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=791.4599999999999s)]
*  There's no chance, no chance that same Jake Tapper and even Alex Thompson will be back [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=792.4599999999999s)]
*  the next time in a Democratic primary telling you, no, the populace, boo, boo. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=798.1s)]
*  No, the corporate Buttigieg. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=804.34s)]
*  I mean, if he says he speaks six languages and that he learned Norwegian to read a book, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=806.0600000000001s)]
*  then we will report it as if it's true. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=810.66s)]
*  They literally did report that. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=814.5s)]
*  They literally did report that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=815.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=817.14s)]
*  And if you challenge them on it now, they're like, what do you mean? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=818.14s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=819.14s)]
*  That's my love at Buttigieg. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=820.14s)]
*  You know how much he's delivered for the donors? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=821.14s)]
*  And it doesn't help that they were as gullible as they were in regard to Biden's mental decline. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=824.0799999999999s)]
*  And then at the same time, right now as we speak, they kind of look down their noses [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=831.5999999999999s)]
*  at the so-called podcast bros. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=835.36s)]
*  The podcast bros had such an influence on the election. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=838.66s)]
*  Maybe ask yourselves why it is that people were more trusting toward random Joes, right, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=842.38s)]
*  that decided to launch podcasts, comedians, entertainers, whatever. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=848.38s)]
*  Why were the American people more likely to hear what they had to say in lieu of consuming [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=852.52s)]
*  your news show or paper, whatever it is? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=859.16s)]
*  Now I wanna go to one final element to the story because now that original sin is out, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=863.8s)]
*  more and more revelations about the Biden campaign are coming out. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=868.72s)]
*  And I thought that this was really interesting because it goes to the heart of the incentives [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=873.12s)]
*  and disincentives within the Biden camp. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=878.56s)]
*  Why was there a cover up? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=882.64s)]
*  It's not just about protecting Biden. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=884.1s)]
*  You think people, I don't, look, maybe some of them care about Biden. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=885.72s)]
*  I don't think that's what this was about. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=888.68s)]
*  I think this is about people who wanted to keep their jobs. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=890.3199999999999s)]
*  They wanted the gravy train flowing for another four years. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=893.16s)]
*  And the best example of that is Mike Donilon, okay? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=896.28s)]
*  Mike Donilon was the chief strategist for Biden's 2024 presidential campaign. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=899.88s)]
*  And according to original sin, he was paid handsomely for that role, disproportionately [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=905.98s)]
*  so. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=912.9399999999999s)]
*  So back in February, by the way, Donilon claimed that the Democratic Party lost its mind when [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=913.9399999999999s)]
*  they ousted Biden from the party's ticket saying the Democratic primary voters chose [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=919.14s)]
*  Joe Biden to be the nominee of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party leadership, and [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=924.4599999999999s)]
*  the biggest funders in America didn't. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=929.34s)]
*  And he said, by the way, again, I wanna reiterate, poll after poll after poll after poll showed [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=932.34s)]
*  that Democratic voters were very much concerned about Biden's age, but they chose to ignore [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=938.42s)]
*  that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=943.38s)]
*  Lots of people have terrible debates. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=944.38s)]
*  Usually the party doesn't lose its mind, but that's what happened. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=946.18s)]
*  It just melted down. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=950.26s)]
*  No, dude, his brain melted down. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=951.78s)]
*  Let's talk about why he was saying those things. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=954.58s)]
*  Did he actually believe it or was he supporting Biden's reelection campaign specifically because [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=956.86s)]
*  there was a lot in it for himself? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=966.0999999999999s)]
*  Donilon had been part of Biden's inner circle for 40 years. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=968.02s)]
*  Biden loved him, which is why he told his campaign, pay him whatever he wants. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=972.3399999999999s)]
*  He wanted $4 million. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=977.18s)]
*  4 million. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=978.98s)]
*  So let's review now. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=981.14s)]
*  If Biden steps down from the race and we have a real primary, the Democrats pick the strongest [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=982.54s)]
*  candidate and maybe beat Trump. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=987.42s)]
*  And that saves the Democratic Party and potentially the country. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=989.4599999999999s)]
*  But Mike Donilon doesn't get $4 million. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=992.86s)]
*  Or Biden stays in the race and cost the Democrats the election. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=996.3s)]
*  Trump is elected and according to Mike Donilon and everybody on the Biden team, we lose democracy [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1000.3s)]
*  because they're the ones that were saying that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1005.3399999999999s)]
*  We lose democracy, but Donilon gets $4 million. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1007.0799999999999s)]
*  Boy, that was a hard choice for him. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1010.06s)]
*  But golly gee, he wound up picking the $4 million over democracy, the Democratic Party [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1012.46s)]
*  and the country. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1016.62s)]
*  That is so surprising. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1017.62s)]
*  Let's go to the last graphic here because the sum was orders of magnitude higher than [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1020.3000000000001s)]
*  the pay for other top aides. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1024.42s)]
*  Campaign chair Jen O'Malley-Dillon made $300,000 and illustrates the standing held by Biden's [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1027.38s)]
*  innermost circle of advisors. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1034.18s)]
*  Many former Biden officials remain bitter at Donilon for making so much money and in [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1036.22s)]
*  their view guiding the campaign into disaster. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1042.06s)]
*  Look guys, let's, I mean, we talked about elder abuse and there's a lot of blame to [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1045.1399999999999s)]
*  go around. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1048.98s)]
*  But Donilon, who Biden trusted when he was mentally healthy, takes a mentally impaired [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1049.98s)]
*  Joe Biden and goes, here Joe, sign this piece of paper. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1057.42s)]
*  It gives me $4 million. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1061.3799999999999s)]
*  It gives me well over 10 times what your campaign manager is getting, right? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1063.1s)]
*  But yeah, yeah, Joe, you want it, Joe. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1068.18s)]
*  Come on, do it, Joe. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1070.54s)]
*  Give me the money, Joe, and stay in the race. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1071.54s)]
*  Whatever you do, don't listen to anyone else. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1073.86s)]
*  You're totally fine, Joe. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1075.82s)]
*  Give me the money and stay in the race, right? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1076.82s)]
*  That's who Donilon is. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1080.5s)]
*  These people sold us out, okay? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1082.3799999999999s)]
*  And they should never, ever work in Washington again. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1084.1399999999999s)]
*  But since they're corporate whores, they'll be the first to get a job. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1087.7s)]
*  First to get a job, I guarantee it. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1091.26s)]
*  Donilon, you think he's out of politics? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1092.94s)]
*  No way. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1094.8999999999999s)]
*  He'll be an insider and he'll be backing the next corporate Democrat that all of mainstream [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1095.8999999999999s)]
*  media will tell you, don't believe your lying eyes or ears. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1100.58s)]
*  The corporate robot here is actually the best candidate, right? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1103.6999999999998s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1107.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1108.46s)]
*  No, I was gonna say that's a good place to leave it, but it looks like you have something [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1109.46s)]
*  else to say. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1112.02s)]
*  No, I'm just gonna give our members the last voice here, because it's such a good point, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1113.02s)]
*  I wanna make it in the story. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1117.5s)]
*  Pessimistic Progressive wrote in, why are we watching this now? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1118.8999999999999s)]
*  Said no football player ever when the coach puts on last week's game's tape. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1123.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great analogy. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1129.3400000000001s)]
*  That's a great analogy. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1130.8600000000001s)]
*  Because no coach is like, let's not learn from our mistakes. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1131.8600000000001s)]
*  If you miss the block, don't sweat it, just miss it again, right? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1135.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you can't miss the block, you gotta get it. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1137.94s)]
*  You watch the tape so you learn what happened and you don't make the same mistake again. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1140.66s)]
*  But the people trying to desperately trying to make sure that you don't watch the tape [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1147.66s)]
*  are the people who want you to make the same mistake again. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1151.5800000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1155.5s)]
*  Sometimes you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1156.5s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR6OIiYC-1g&t=1159.18s)]
