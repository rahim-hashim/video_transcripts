The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful.

# Laura Ingraham Really Just Said This OUT LOUD About Zohran Mamdani
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I)
*  This guy makes AOC look like a moderate. He wants government run grocery stores, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=0.0s)]
*  plans to make public buses free, is pledging to freeze rent prices and wants to borrow [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=4.24s)]
*  $70 billion for more affordable housing. Unless rich New Yorkers band together, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=9.36s)]
*  donate a lot of money and create a groundswell for a viable alternative to Mom Donnie, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  another great American city is gonna swirl down the drain. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=20.32s)]
*  Wow, way to say the quiet part out loud, Laura Ingraham, like, oh, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=23.92s)]
*  us rich people are really worried about this Zoran Mondami guy. We gotta do something about [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  it. Rich people need to band together. Now look, Laura Ingraham has joined the chorus [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  of Republicans and corporate Democrats that are absolutely panicking about New York City [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=42.0s)]
*  mayoral candidate Zoran Mom Donnie and his victory over Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=48.48s)]
*  race. Now the general election hasn't happened yet, but it does appear that he's poised to win. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=55.68s)]
*  And so Laura Ingraham explicitly calling on rich New Yorkers to come together to take him down [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  really tells you everything you need to know about why certain candidates tend to get targeted, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=67.44s)]
*  smeared and destroyed much like Senator Bernie Sanders was when he was running for president. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=73.76s)]
*  Now, I wanna show you a little more. So there's a lot more to get to, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=81.2s)]
*  including what Bill Ackman is gonna try to do to defeat him. But before we get to any of that, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=87.84s)]
*  Cenk, initial thoughts. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=92.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that intro by Laura Ingraham is for the ages. Because I mean, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=93.76s)]
*  she doesn't realize how funny that is. She's like, this guy wants to do affordable housing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=100.56s)]
*  and free buses for the masses. Rich people have to band together to make sure this doesn't happen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=106.64s)]
*  You're just saying it, right? You know that, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=115.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=117.68s)]
*  You're on air. You're telling, saying, hey, rich people, let's make sure that the middle class [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  and the poor don't get anything. And this son of a bitch looks like he's looking out for the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  average guy. Let's band together, rich, okay? Okay, thank you. Thank you for the confession, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=128.96s)]
*  Laura. We appreciate it. Bill Ackman's confession is coming up in a little bit. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=134.32000000000002s)]
*  But we're asking you guys, are they gonna be successful? Because look, on the live chat on [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=138.08s)]
*  YouTube, we're asking whether MAGA is gonna be successful in taking down Zorah Mamdani. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=143.12s)]
*  And you guys are good and optimistic, 79% saying no. On tyt.com, we're asking, do you think the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=148.72s)]
*  establishment will be able to take down Mamdani in the general election in New York City? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=155.2s)]
*  And I'm curious about that as well, because what we have here is a unique situation, Anna, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=161.2s)]
*  where we have radical right, who's like, Muslim, terrorists, hate them, Sharia law, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=166.16s)]
*  what an insanity, stuff like that. In cooperation with and in coalition with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=172.0s)]
*  establishment Republicans and establishment Democrats. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=179.2s)]
*  And so they're all unified against them, which makes you wanna root for them even more, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=183.36s)]
*  And so will they be able to spend enough money, do enough propaganda, control the media enough [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=189.12s)]
*  to be able to defeat them in the general election? Well, that's another part of the story. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=194.96s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, I mean, we can't discount the media's involvement in all of this because [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=199.04s)]
*  Bill Lander, who was the progressive candidate in the mayoral race, was actually on Jake Tapper's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=205.6s)]
*  show on CNN, of course, to discuss Mamdani's win. And Tapper asked about Mamdani's alleged [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=211.04s)]
*  anti-Semitism. Okay, so he wants the Palestinian people to not be slaughtered. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=221.76s)]
*  He wants them to be treated with equality and respect. And apparently, if you have those [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=230.16s)]
*  beliefs, you're automatically considered an anti-Semite, especially if you happen to be Muslim. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=234.88s)]
*  But let's get to Bill Ackman, because Bill Ackman is real scurred, and he's willing to do [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=239.6s)]
*  something about it. He's willing to put big bucks behind essentially defeating [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=244.88s)]
*  Mamdani in the general election. So he's vowed to back a challenger to Zoran Mamdani [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=250.0s)]
*  to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. In a 1500 word post on X, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=257.12s)]
*  Ackman ranted about how dangerous he thinks that Mamdani is. He says, I awoke this morning, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=264.4s)]
*  gravely concerned about New York City. Socialism has no place in the economic capital of our [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=272.24s)]
*  country. The ability for New York City to offer services for the poor and needy, let alone [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=278.0s)]
*  the average New Yorker, is entirely dependent on New York City being a business-friendly [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=283.68s)]
*  environment and a place where wealthy residents are willing to spend 183 days and assume the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=289.04s)]
*  associated tax burden. Unfortunately, both have already started making arrangements for the exits. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=296.56s)]
*  You know what? I think Ackman actually makes a really great point. When I think about [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=304.32s)]
*  prosperity for the working class, I really do think about Wall Street. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=308.23999999999995s)]
*  And when I think about socialism, I also think about Wall Street and bailouts. Cenk, back to you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so again, saying the quiet part out loud, he's saying, I am going to spend [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=318.23999999999995s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars along with my rich friends to buy this seat. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=325.28s)]
*  Thank you for the confession. Okay, I appreciate it. So then now, New York, you've got a choice. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=329.36s)]
*  Are you going to let really rich people on Wall Street buy the election so that all the costs [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=336.24s)]
*  are put on you and they get a free ride? So Ackman has two reasons why he's so animated [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=342.72s)]
*  by Zoran Mamdani. One, he's a giant bigot and racist. So if he sees someone that's Muslim, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=348.64s)]
*  and in this case, Mamdani happens to be Indian from Uganda. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=355.92s)]
*  And so he looks at him, he doesn't bow down to Israel. Terrorist, right? When in reality, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=361.6s)]
*  Bill Ackman is pro-genocide. So he's much, much closer to a terrorist. Well, it's not even close. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  Mamdani hates terrorism and is not at all anti-Semitic. And he wants peace for Israel and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=375.68s)]
*  Palestine, but Ackman doesn't want that. Ackman is pro-slaughter. And so he's saying, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=381.36s)]
*  I want more of a slaughterhouse in Gaza. And this guy, I know he's the Mayor of New York, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  but it doesn't affect anything, but it bothers me. He's not even pro-genocide. It bothers me, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=391.44s)]
*  okay? I'm sorry, are you bothered, billionaire? I'm sorry, are you bothered that we're not doing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=396.8s)]
*  enough genocides for your liking? And this is a sick state of our so-called democracy, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  where oligarchs feel no pressure at all not to say these things out loud and in public. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=408.32s)]
*  And they're, I will be buying this election on behalf of Israel and my other rich friends [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  on Wall Street here in New York. And that's the second reason why Ackman's so, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=419.44s)]
*  and that's why Mamdani has become this target for all of the most toxic people in the country. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=423.84s)]
*  Because he animates the rich too, like the super rich that love to corrupt the government. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=432.08s)]
*  Not the super rich that don't corrupt the government, they're different categories, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=437.92s)]
*  okay? But people who are used to buying political seats like Ackman, they're like, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=441.04s)]
*  we didn't even buy this one. And he's saying that he would raise corporate taxes for New York City [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=446.8s)]
*  from around 7% to around 11%. An extra 4% are due to cry, fellow billionaires. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  We've got a terrorist here looking to raise our taxes, and he's not even in favor of genocide. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  No, we will be defeating him with all of our money, we will purchase the seat. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=467.2s)]
*  Well, I hope that money gets shoved straight up your ass. Now, rhetorically, metaphorically, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=471.76s)]
*  okay? Not literally, so don't get all upset and say, I would have spent hundreds of millions of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  dollars trying to defeat the young tax. They are anti-genocide, I despise them. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=484.08s)]
*  And I want more tax cuts. Yeah, we got it, billionaire Sir Topham Hatt, mother effort, we got it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=491.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay, get your phone ready so you can scroll through Twitter as I go through the rest of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  this story, because I'm not gonna go back to you for a while. But let me just say in regard to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=501.6s)]
*  shoving money up his ass, listen, Bill Ackman's a wealthy man, and wealthy people love to do all [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  sorts of weird new wave health treatments. Who knows what kind of expensive enemas that guy is [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=510.8s)]
*  up to. But nonetheless, let me give you some more details about how he originally felt depressed [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=516.24s)]
*  about Mom Donnie. But now he says he's feeling optimistic about the situation. Now, why is that? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=521.92s)]
*  The good news, he writes, is that there are other charismatic, intelligent, articulate, handsome, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=528.08s)]
*  charming, young, yet more experienced, and importantly, more centrist politicians who are [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=534.32s)]
*  New York residents eligible for office. Okay, well, why didn't they run? They didn't run. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=542.08s)]
*  He says there are also extremely talented members of the New York business community [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=547.44s)]
*  who could be superb mayors. Bloomberg being the reference standard from the past. Wow, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  this guy's super out of touch. And look, he plans to help bankroll any so-called [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  centrist that choose to challenge Mom Donnie. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=565.52s)]
*  Importantly, he writes, there are hundreds of millions of dollars of capital available [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=568.88s)]
*  to back a competitor to Mom Donnie that can be put together overnight. Believe me, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=574.96s)]
*  I am in the text strings and the WhatsApp groups so that a great alternative candidate won't [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=580.64s)]
*  spend any time raising funds. If someone is ready to raise their hand, I will take care of the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=588.8s)]
*  fundraising. I'm sure he will. Now, he goes on and on and on about how it would be a great [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=595.2s)]
*  opportunity for a challenger to essentially build name recognition and be a hero for [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=600.48s)]
*  the Democratic Party. And by the way, the type of candidate that he's talking about, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=607.5200000000001s)]
*  dime a dozen. Okay, centrist Democrats, dime a dozen. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=612.1600000000001s)]
*  Corporate Democrats, dime a dozen. I think what you're experiencing right now with the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=615.12s)]
*  rise of Mom Donnie is a rejection of the types of, honestly, policies that both corporate [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=619.76s)]
*  Republicans and corporate Democrats have been championing. I think they're sick. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=626.96s)]
*  American people are sick of being nickel and dimed and they want a better system. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=630.88s)]
*  They want to see an end to the ever growing wealth inequality in this country. And so when [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=635.2s)]
*  you have someone who focuses heavily on economic policies, of course, he's gonna be incredibly [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=641.52s)]
*  appealing to the people of New York City, which has an extremely high cost of living. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=648.08s)]
*  Now, he, meaning Ackman, actually has someone superb in mind for a write-in campaign, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=653.12s)]
*  but said that since he's a Trump supporter, his public endorsement would probably hurt the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=660.4000000000001s)]
*  candidate. So he's waiting for someone else to make the first move. And his fellow rich New [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=665.2s)]
*  Yorkers, meanwhile, are equally concerned and already scheming with their own plans. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=670.64s)]
*  So Semaphore reported on Wednesday that many others in the city's business community are [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=676.16s)]
*  considering shifting their support from Cuomo to Eric Adams. And according to New York's David [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=681.36s)]
*  Freelander, several leaders in the real estate and business world had a group phone call to [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=689.28s)]
*  discuss what to do after Mom Donnie's victory. So make no mistake about it, these people definitely [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=696.88s)]
*  want to destroy Mom Donnie's chances of winning in the general election. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=703.9200000000001s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether or not they'll succeed. But money talks, and I am a little bit [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=708.96s)]
*  concerned, and all sorts of tricks have been played in the past that unfortunately have worked. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=713.84s)]
*  Yesterday we talked about upstate New York. There was a socialist who won a local race, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=718.24s)]
*  at least the first round, and then lost in the general because the Democrat challenging this [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=723.12s)]
*  individual decided to run as an independent. Now, in this case, Cuomo appears to have dropped out [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=728.1600000000001s)]
*  of the race entirely, which is a good sign. But we'll see if Bill Ackman and the rest of the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=732.48s)]
*  people panicking about Mom Donnie will find a strategy that will be successful. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=738.88s)]
*  Cenk. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=742.64s)]
*  Yeah, they're thinking of doing a writing candidate, which is harder, but people have won as a writing [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=743.14s)]
*  candidate before, especially if you pour a lot of money into it. And some of the Democratic donors [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=748.72s)]
*  poured a lot of money into having Joe Biden needlessly win the New Hampshire primary as a [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=753.28s)]
*  writing candidate last time around. And so maybe they can monster up to my, and they have a secret [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=758.16s)]
*  weapon I'll get to in a second, but more confessions that I like. He's like, I'm not gonna tell you the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=764.24s)]
*  candidate I prefer, but we'll pick him and then I'll pretend that I had nothing to do with it. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=769.36s)]
*  You know you're saying things in public, right? So you just said you're a Trump-supporting [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  billionaire who will pick the Democratic candidate and then pretend he didn't. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=780.4s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=784.56s)]
*  You just said it. And in the post, you talked about hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=786.72s)]
*  And then we'll take the billionaire money, Democrat and Republican, doesn't matter, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=792.88s)]
*  they're all part of the unit party establishment, etc. And then we'll use it to try to defeat a [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=796.64s)]
*  person that's trying to represent the average man, cuz we hate the average man. You know you're [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=800.72s)]
*  saying things in public, right? He didn't say he hates the average man that's in between the lines. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=805.12s)]
*  And all this about Bill Ackman is my opinion. You can form any opinion you like. Maybe you [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=809.28s)]
*  could read his post on your own and say, my God, I love this. Finally somebody standing up for [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=815.36s)]
*  billionaires. Now when he says it and Ana says it that these, there's so many candidates we could [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=821.28s)]
*  have to run here. It's true because the reason there are a dime a dozen is because they're all [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=827.52s)]
*  corporate robots off the Bill Ackman and billionaire assembly line. They're like, okay, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=831.84s)]
*  will you do what we want? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Will you do anything to help the average person? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=836.56s)]
*  No, no, no, doesn't matter. It's a good assembly line. Buttigieg and everybody else just care, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=841.6s)]
*  News Sim, keep going, keep going. Mitch McConnell, whoever, it doesn't matter, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=846.72s)]
*  they're all corporate robots. And so lastly, you guys are a little bit more optimistic than I am. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=849.9200000000001s)]
*  I wanted to see how optimistic you are. Will the establishment be able to defeat [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=856.48s)]
*  Mom Donnie in the general election? And you guys say 86 to 14, no. And I hope you're right and keep [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=860.08s)]
*  voting tyt.com. And so the reason why I'm a little worried and what I want to give you guys [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=867.2s)]
*  a heads up about is, look, they're not going to defeat him with just commercials, the ads. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=871.5200000000001s)]
*  That doesn't work as much anymore. And how many ads can you buy? You could swamp all of New York, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=876.5600000000001s)]
*  which is very, very expensive, but with hundreds of millions of dollars, you could do it, right? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=881.44s)]
*  But I don't think that's going to get the job done. I think that what I want you to know and [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=884.88s)]
*  look for going forward from this day to the day of the general election in New York is watch what the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=890.96s)]
*  mainstream media does, because they're the actual hatchet men. Remember the Ackman money [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=896.8s)]
*  goes into buying ads in mainstream media. And then mainstream media coincidentally supports [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=903.12s)]
*  their candidate 100% and then digs and digs and digs and tries to find something wrong with Mom [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=910.56s)]
*  Donnie and then comes out and goes, we have this and this and this. And a Republican congressman [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=916.0s)]
*  today already at it. He found a rap lyric in something Mom Donnie sang once and he's like, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=922.48s)]
*  he's supporting the wrong people in a rap line or whatever. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=930.16s)]
*  So you're going to see 200 stories like that as mainstream media on purpose is all negative [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=933.2s)]
*  against Mom Donnie going forward and they will try to bury him. It'll be the media that does it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=941.12s)]
*  They're the culprit. Every time you ring the bell below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=947.52s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep you updated on our live shows. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOj6_CZFP_I&t=951.68s)]
