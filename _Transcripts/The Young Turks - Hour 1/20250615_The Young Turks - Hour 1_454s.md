TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Israel Faces BIG TIME Consequences For Committing A Genocide
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug)
*  Israel's war on Gaza appears to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=0.0s)]
*  have some devastating impacts on [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=2.92s)]
*  businesses in Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=5.82s)]
*  Because new data that's been [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=8.02s)]
*  obtained by DropSite News has shown [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  that they're actually having a much [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=12.3s)]
*  harder time finding customers [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=14.52s)]
*  compared to how they were feeling [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=16.52s)]
*  back in 2023, certainly after the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=18.86s)]
*  Hamas attacks on October 7th. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=21.36s)]
*  So in order to kind of understand [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=23.48s)]
*  the metrics here, we have to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=25.84s)]
*  understand the lingo that's used in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=27.939999999999998s)]
*  compiling this type of data. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=30.5s)]
*  So allow me to first explain the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=32.54s)]
*  concept of cost per click or CPC, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=34.86s)]
*  which is a term that meta uses. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=37.5s)]
*  So it refers to how much a company [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=39.78s)]
*  has to spend in order to get [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=42.42s)]
*  a consumer to click on its [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=44.66s)]
*  advertisements, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  So the lower a company's CPC, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=49.54s)]
*  the less it has to spend on [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=52.099999999999994s)]
*  its advertising. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=54.3s)]
*  The less it has to spend to attract [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  new customers, the more it has to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=59.22s)]
*  spend, the less viable a business [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  becomes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  And boy, have they been spending [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=66.14s)]
*  more and more, which means that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=68.17999999999999s)]
*  their businesses are struggling to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=70.1s)]
*  find customers. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=72.34s)]
*  So leaked data from meta shows that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=73.38s)]
*  Israeli businesses have seen their [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=75.7s)]
*  CPC skyrocket, especially over [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=78.22s)]
*  the past two years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=80.74s)]
*  So between 2023 and 2025, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=82.25999999999999s)]
*  the CPC for Israeli companies [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=84.38s)]
*  increased by a staggering 155.3%, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=86.98s)]
*  rising from 0.094 cents to 0.24 [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=90.58s)]
*  cents or 24 cents, required to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=93.94s)]
*  drive an individual potential [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=97.02s)]
*  customer to the website of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=99.66s)]
*  an Israeli firm. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=101.94s)]
*  So far in 2025, the number of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=103.66s)]
*  clicks Israeli companies have had [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=106.02s)]
*  on their advertisements is only 39.2% [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=108.82s)]
*  of their recorded total in 2023, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=112.54s)]
*  which explains why Israeli firms [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=115.34s)]
*  must now pay more than double in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=117.98s)]
*  advertising costs to lure customers. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  And the leaked data from meta also [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  reveals how Israel compares to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=125.86000000000001s)]
*  other countries when it comes to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=128.18s)]
*  CPC metrics. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=130.5s)]
*  So let's take a quick look at that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=131.62s)]
*  Israel was the country with the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=133.66s)]
*  highest increase in CPC expense [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=135.66s)]
*  year over year between 2023 and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=137.74s)]
*  2024, the CPC has been the highest [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=139.86s)]
*  year of the data shows. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=142.14s)]
*  With the next two highest [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=143.66s)]
*  countries being Iraq and Pakistan, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=145.54s)]
*  for the United States users [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=148.42s)]
*  targeted by Israeli ads, I'm sorry, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  for US users targeted by Israeli [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=153.54s)]
*  ads, the CPC between 2023 and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  2024 increased by 93.32% for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=158.66s)]
*  the same period. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=161.82s)]
*  CPC for non-Israeli companies [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  advertising in the US went up by [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=166.06s)]
*  only 2.8%, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=168.5s)]
*  a pretty significant difference [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=169.62s)]
*  there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=171.78s)]
*  So, prior to the atrocities that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  Israel is currently committing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=174.62s)]
*  against the Palestinian people, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  both in Gaza and the West Bank, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=179.26s)]
*  I was kind of standoffish in regard [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=181.42s)]
*  to the BDS movement. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=183.78s)]
*  I'm no longer standoffish about it, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=185.26s)]
*  I fully support it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  And it's because I don't really see [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=189.94s)]
*  any other way in influencing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=192.89999999999998s)]
*  the Israeli government or [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=195.22s)]
*  the Israeli people in what they're [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=198.26000000000002s)]
*  doing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=200.38000000000002s)]
*  You can't rely on the American [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=200.9s)]
*  government, the American government [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  is completely bought by [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=204.9s)]
*  pro-Israel interests. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't matter if you elect [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  a Democrat or a Republican, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=209.02s)]
*  doesn't matter who controls [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  Congress, they're going to defend [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=211.86s)]
*  Israel and aid in a bet, anything [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=213.82000000000002s)]
*  and everything Israel wants to do. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=215.9s)]
*  So the power really rests among [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=217.94s)]
*  the people, meaning us. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  And if boycotts worked in apartheid [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=222.3s)]
*  South Africa, it might work in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=225.06s)]
*  this situation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=227.22s)]
*  But either way, whether you support [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=228.46s)]
*  BDS or not, these atrocities are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=230.78s)]
*  harming both the Israeli economy [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=232.94s)]
*  overall and specific Israeli based [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=235.18s)]
*  businesses. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  What do you think, Was? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=238.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'm curious as to how people [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  would know that these companies [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=242.82000000000002s)]
*  are Israeli. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=245.3s)]
*  That's what I wonder if they're [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=246.58s)]
*  just obviously marketing themselves [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=248.9s)]
*  and they're just trying to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=251.78s)]
*  marketing themselves as Israeli [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=253.9s)]
*  firms, which I think would be not [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=256.5s)]
*  smart considering what they're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=259.18s)]
*  going out there and doing. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=261.98s)]
*  And to your point about boycotting [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=264.26s)]
*  Israel, I remember talking to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=267.38s)]
*  somebody a while back, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=269.90000000000003s)]
*  it would have probably been in [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=271.82s)]
*  like 2024. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=274.38s)]
*  And I was like, well, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  has diplomacy, sort of like [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=277.22s)]
*  peaceful protest, has that ever [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=279.86s)]
*  been incentivized in the history [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=282.34s)]
*  of the conflict? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=284.9s)]
*  And it was swift, it was like no, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=286.3s)]
*  no, no, no, no, they've never been [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=288.86s)]
*  rewarded for trying to go a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=291.62s)]
*  peaceful route to a resolution to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=293.82s)]
*  the conflict. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=296.74s)]
*  And so if that's never been [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=297.98s)]
*  incentivized ever, no results have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=300.02s)]
*  ever been born from doing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=302.74s)]
*  nonviolent protests, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  and then of course they do what [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  feels like a last resort, which is [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=308.86s)]
*  commit horrible atrocities on [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=311.22s)]
*  October 7th and obviously, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=313.5s)]
*  that's not working. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=315.58000000000004s)]
*  Perhaps this is a third way man, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=317.18s)]
*  yeah, for the international [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=319.38000000000005s)]
*  community to sort of band together [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=321.38000000000005s)]
*  and be like, dude, enough's enough. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=323.82000000000005s)]
*  Treat these people like human [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=326.54s)]
*  beings or we're not with you and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=328.38s)]
*  your companies. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=330.38s)]
*  And I now have a feeling that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=331.5s)]
*  And I now fully understand, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=334.38s)]
*  I understood before, but [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=336.54s)]
*  I've fully internalized and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=338.66s)]
*  absorbed this. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=341.22s)]
*  The reason why there's so [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=343.42s)]
*  much backlash from the Israeli [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=344.9s)]
*  government and to some extent, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=346.62s)]
*  our own government toward those who [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=348.5s)]
*  are part of the BDS movement is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=350.82s)]
*  because of how successful these [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=352.9s)]
*  boycotts were in the context of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=355.3s)]
*  South Africa. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=357.66s)]
*  So I fully support those, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=359.74s)]
*  I fully support those who want to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=362.34000000000003s)]
*  be part of the BDS movement. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=364.18s)]
*  I'm not part of the BDS movement [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=365.98s)]
*  specifically, but I've decided to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=367.94s)]
*  boycott Israeli made products for [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=370.1s)]
*  obvious reasons. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=372.18s)]
*  I just disagree with this war, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=373.54s)]
*  I find it disgusting and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=375.14s)]
*  it's not even a war, it's a genocide. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=376.38s)]
*  I don't know any Israeli products, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=378.46000000000004s)]
*  do you like know anything? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=381.26s)]
*  Yeah, there's a list, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=383.58000000000004s)]
*  there's a list that you can access. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=384.82s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=386.7s)]
*  it does pain me because, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=388.58000000000004s)]
*  Israeli designers, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=390.86s)]
*  fashion designers are freaking [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=392.42s)]
*  amazing, they're so talented. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=394.62s)]
*  My wedding dress was made by [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=396.70000000000005s)]
*  an Israeli designer, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=398.54s)]
*  Orabela Bridal was the name [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=400.14000000000004s)]
*  of the brand. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=402.1s)]
*  So yeah, and the reason why I [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=403.3s)]
*  previously didn't think BDS was [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=405.66s)]
*  something I was interested in is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=408.46000000000004s)]
*  because usually boycotts or [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=411.18s)]
*  sanctions, economic sanctions, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=413.58000000000004s)]
*  harm civilians and really you want [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=416.42s)]
*  to send a message to a government [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=419.02s)]
*  and not harm civilians. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=421.38s)]
*  But I feel like our backs are up [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=423.14s)]
*  against a wall and I can't take [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=424.94s)]
*  what's happening any longer. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=426.9s)]
*  It's just so gross and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=428.74s)]
*  it needs to stop, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=430.18s)]
*  the killing needs to end. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=431.26s)]
*  And it's not going to end through [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=432.74s)]
*  our government doing the right [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=434.46s)]
*  thing, it's not going to end with [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=436.09999999999997s)]
*  their government doing the right [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=437.82s)]
*  thing, there needs to be action [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  through a grassroots effort. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=441.41999999999996s)]
*  And I think economic boycotts [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=443.34s)]
*  might work, so we'll see. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=445.21999999999997s)]
*  Every time you ring the bell [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=447.65999999999997s)]
*  below, an angel gets his wings. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=449.21999999999997s)]
*  Totally not true, but it does keep [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz77Q4hNIug&t=451.02s)]
