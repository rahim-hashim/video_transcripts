TYT is the largest online news network in the country. It presents news, context and analysis. We have dozens of on-air hosts on half a dozen major channels on almost all the platforms. We also have a live 24-hour news channel that features all our shows.
The Young Turks is the flagship show of the TYY Network. The Young Turks is the longest running daily show in internet history. We‚Äôre about to celebrate our 20th anniversary as a digital native show. We are also the first ever YouTube partner channel. So, we are the original YouTubers.
On the network, we do things a little differently than other places. We present the news first, with all of the facts and context you need, which is a rarity in commentary-heavy online shows. We then also give analysis and perspective, which is rare in traditional news.
Our commentary and perspective are almost always on the left, but we have an enormous range of opinions on the network. Hosts are allowed to think and say whatever they like. Perspectives usually range from the far left to the center of the political spectrum.
Now, our presence and range is large enough that we are adopting the tagline The Online News Network. Our longevity, our 27 million subscribers and 30 billion lifetime views allows us to make this claim confidently.
TYT emphasizes open-minds and open-hearts. We believe in fighting for the average American. We believe in challenging the powerful. We are vigilant about pursuing the truth to the best of our abilities and for always being honest with our audience. We‚Äôve been proud to serve the internet for longer than any other news show or network. As one of the founding fathers and mothers of online media, we have always believed that digital media would become the dominant news source for all Americans. We‚Äôre thrilled that day is here and that TYT is where everyone can come to see The Online News Network.

# Ted Cruz Gives PSYCHOTIC Excuse For Unwavering Support Of Israel
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU)
*  During Tucker Carlson's interview [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=0.0s)]
*  of Texas Senator Ted Cruz, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=2.58s)]
*  one of our favorites, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  the topic of the Bible came up. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=6.3s)]
*  And usually I wouldn't be all that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=8.76s)]
*  interested. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=10.86s)]
*  I want to hear two grown men [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=11.86s)]
*  talking about the Bible, right? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=13.18s)]
*  It's not for me, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=14.94s)]
*  it's for other people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=16.06s)]
*  However, Ted Cruz brought up [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=17.66s)]
*  the Bible in the context of why he [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=20.06s)]
*  supports the country of Israel so [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=22.7s)]
*  aggressively, fair enough. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=25.3s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=28.38s)]
*  Now, one thing that I know for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=29.459999999999997s)]
*  sure about Tucker Carlson is that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=30.959999999999997s)]
*  he is a man of faith, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=32.78s)]
*  he's not faking it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  He talks about his faith all [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=34.92s)]
*  the time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=36.8s)]
*  And since he's knowledgeable about [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=38.28s)]
*  the Bible, he thought he would [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=39.98s)]
*  challenge Ted Cruz a little bit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=41.32s)]
*  So without further ado, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  let's take a look. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=43.94s)]
*  Growing up in Sunday school, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=46.12s)]
*  I was taught from the Bible, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=47.62s)]
*  those who bless Israel will be [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=49.12s)]
*  blessed and those who curse Israel [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=50.72s)]
*  will be cursed. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  And from my perspective, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=54.28s)]
*  I want to be on the blessing side [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=55.46s)]
*  of things. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=56.8s)]
*  Those who bless the government of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Israel? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=59.08s)]
*  Those who bless Israel is what it [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=59.6s)]
*  says, it doesn't say the government [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=60.8s)]
*  of it, it says the nation of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=63.28s)]
*  So that's in the Bible, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=63.8s)]
*  as a Christian, I believe that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=65.12s)]
*  Where is that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=66.84s)]
*  I can find it to you, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't have the scripture off [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=69.0s)]
*  the tip of my, you pull out [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=70.52s)]
*  the phone and use the- [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=72.0s)]
*  It's in Genesis, but so [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=73.16s)]
*  you're quoting a Bible phrase, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=74.64s)]
*  you don't have context for it, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=76.6s)]
*  you don't know where in the Bible [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=78.2s)]
*  it is, but that's like her [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=79.68s)]
*  theology, I'm confused. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=81.04s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=82.32s)]
*  Tucker. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=83.72s)]
*  I'm a Christian, I want to know [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=85.0s)]
*  what you're talking about. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=86.16s)]
*  Where does my support for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=87.98s)]
*  Israel come from, number one? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  Because biblically we're [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=92.06s)]
*  commanded to support Israel, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  but number two- [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=94.38s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, you're a senator [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=95.08s)]
*  and now you're throwing out [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=96.58s)]
*  theology and I am a Christian and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=97.94s)]
*  I am allowed to weigh in on this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=99.5s)]
*  We are commanded as Christians to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=101.9s)]
*  support the government of Israel? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=103.10000000000001s)]
*  We are commanded to support [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=105.86s)]
*  Is the nation God is referring to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=106.4s)]
*  in Genesis, is that the same as [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=108.06s)]
*  the country run by Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=109.58s)]
*  right now? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=111.42s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=112.06s)]
*  It is, okay. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=113.06s)]
*  That is psychotic, okay? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=113.78s)]
*  What Ted Cruz said there is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=115.72s)]
*  psychotic. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=117.24s)]
*  Really, you're going to hide [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=118.04s)]
*  behind the Bible to explain your [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=120.04s)]
*  unwavering commitment to a man who [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=122.2s)]
*  is running a government that's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=124.72s)]
*  carrying out a genocide right now? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=127.0s)]
*  Really, that's what your theology [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=129.44s)]
*  is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=131.64s)]
*  See, people like Ted Cruz, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=132.16s)]
*  unfortunately, for those who are [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=133.96s)]
*  actually genuine about their faith, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=136.16s)]
*  a dead man is a dead man. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=138.56s)]
*  And I think that's what [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=140.28s)]
*  people who are genuine about their [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=141.78s)]
*  faith, a detriment. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  People like Ted Cruz turn people [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=145.38s)]
*  off to religion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, obviously there are other [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  reasons why people don't believe in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=150.54s)]
*  religion, they might be agnostic, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=152.34s)]
*  atheist, spiritual, whatever. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  But part of the reason why I [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=156.45999999999998s)]
*  personally got turned off by [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  Christianity, which by the way, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=160.5s)]
*  I grew up going to Sunday school [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  every Sunday from like 3 to 19, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=165.06s)]
*  okay? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=167.42s)]
*  At no point did I learn that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=167.94s)]
*  in Sunday school that to be a good [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  Christian, you have to support [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=172.52s)]
*  the government of Israel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=174.72s)]
*  Ted Cruz just made that up. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=177.08s)]
*  He just made that up. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=179.0s)]
*  And so he's hiding behind his [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=181.4s)]
*  religion to carry out whatever he [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=183.44s)]
*  wants to carry out, for whatever [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=185.74s)]
*  reason he wants to carry it out. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=187.88s)]
*  I mean, obviously he's backed by [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=190.08s)]
*  APAC to a pretty significant degree, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=192.0s)]
*  has taken more than half a million [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=194.24s)]
*  dollars in campaign contributions [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=196.08s)]
*  from them throughout his Senate [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  years. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=200.26s)]
*  Don't hide behind your religion, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=200.78s)]
*  bro, just tell the truth. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=202.61999999999998s)]
*  I mean, tell us why you think it's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=205.7s)]
*  so important to prioritize a foreign [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=207.7s)]
*  country over the country that you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=209.73999999999998s)]
*  were elected to serve. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=211.7s)]
*  I love the fact that Tucker Carlson [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH6Po1jiwMU&t=212.98s)]
