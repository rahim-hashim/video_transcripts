# Slammer For Santos - The Young Turks - April 2025
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU)
*  Condoms for Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=0.0s)]
*  Hot dog is my favorite meat. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2.0s)]
*  Well, hello! [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=4.0s)]
*  Let's drop it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=30.0s)]
*  Welcome, what else we close things out in this big old week with the power panel. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=60.0s)]
*  I'm John Iderola. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=68.0s)]
*  Michael Schor is actually here in studio. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=69.64s)]
*  It's good to be here in studio. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=72.0s)]
*  It's been a bit. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=74.0s)]
*  It's been a bit. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=75.0s)]
*  Jordan showed up. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=76.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=77.0s)]
*  He could have done the bare minimum and show up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=78.0s)]
*  But unfortunately, we just got him remote. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=79.72s)]
*  But still, I guess that's something. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=81.92s)]
*  Jordan, how's it going? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=83.4s)]
*  What a welcome. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=85.68s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=87.0s)]
*  I just got insulted by my co-host. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=88.0s)]
*  How's it going? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=90.48s)]
*  It was just suggestive persuasion. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=92.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=95.4s)]
*  So next time we'd love to see you here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=96.4s)]
*  That's all. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=98.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=99.4s)]
*  So if you're on the podcast, you may not know. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=100.4s)]
*  There's a little weird thing going on with the shots right now where I feel like I'm [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=101.4s)]
*  lower than Michael and that Jordan is significantly bigger. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=105.08s)]
*  I am very funny way. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=108.6s)]
*  But yeah, I was just saying I wanted my seat raised. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=110.6s)]
*  No, you cannot go any higher. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=113.52s)]
*  In fact, can you lower him? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=115.44s)]
*  I'll slump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=117.32s)]
*  Go down a little bit. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=118.32s)]
*  I feel like Jordan, because we insulted him playfully, decided to visually dominate the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=119.32s)]
*  frame by moving forward. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=124.72s)]
*  But anyway, glad to have both of you gents here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=126.64s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=130.04s)]
*  Glad to have all of you out in the audience here because we have a lot of interesting [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=131.2s)]
*  news to get to in both foreign and domestic news. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=133.72s)]
*  Consequences for fraud and illegal acts. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=138.6s)]
*  Not with anyone in the top 20 politicians I would have chosen to actually suffer consequences. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=141.78s)]
*  He'd be in my top 20 actually. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=147.0s)]
*  Top 50 for me easily. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=150.24s)]
*  But anyway, we got an appearance of a cat tail right there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=151.84s)]
*  And we'll be discussing some of the big rising stars in the Democratic Party to end this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=154.92s)]
*  first hour. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=159.96s)]
*  And so we're gonna jump into the news. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=160.96s)]
*  Send us your comments, your tweets and your super chats. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=163.24s)]
*  All that will be responding to the social breaks. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=164.96s)]
*  And with all that, why don't we jump into this? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=166.84s)]
*  I think to a degree is embarrassing President Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=170.44s)]
*  When he bombed Kiev in this brutal attack, the worst you're watching it now. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=173.6s)]
*  Worst in a year. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=176.96s)]
*  Worst in a year. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=177.96s)]
*  And killed these innocent people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=178.96s)]
*  That was actually a pretty amazing little bit of video that you have Brian Kilmeade [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  both caring about the fact that these civilians were once again killed in Ukraine in this [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=185.24s)]
*  absolutely vicious bombing of Kiev. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=189.88s)]
*  Which look, he's spoken out in defense of Ukrainians before. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=192.4s)]
*  That's maybe not the most surprising thing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=195.32s)]
*  But the Kilmeade also very clearly states that Putin is embarrassing Donald Trump and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=197.04s)]
*  that this peace process is not going at all as smoothly as Donald Trump implied that it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=202.4s)]
*  would. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=206.56s)]
*  And so Putin kills a bunch of people again. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  Vicious assault as Donald Trump pretends that he's closing in on a peace deal. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  And what does Donald Trump have in response? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  We're gonna flashback a couple days ago on True Social when he posted this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=217.44000000000003s)]
*  I am not happy with the Russian strikes on Kiev. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=221.0s)]
*  Not necessary and very bad timing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir stop. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=228.24s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week are dying. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=230.28s)]
*  Let's get the peace deal done. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=232.44s)]
*  And that's just so weird. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=234.52s)]
*  The first name basis with Vladimir when he's literally never done that with Zelensky and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=236.44s)]
*  the very bad timing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=240.4s)]
*  When would be a good timing, Donald, for civilians to be murdered? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=245.88s)]
*  When would it be better on the weekend? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  Would it be like you get to do your fake peace deal and then you can go back to killing the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=251.88s)]
*  civilians? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  When would be great timing? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  I kind of feel like it's always bad timing and that's always a weird way to address the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=256.92s)]
*  murder of civilians. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  He's a super weird guy, super unserious guy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  And as we said, by the way, this should have been done about 99 days ago. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=265.12s)]
*  He implied day one over and over and over again. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=269.16s)]
*  I must have missed though. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=272.6s)]
*  He was joking, it turns out, because he said, well, I said that figuratively. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=273.8s)]
*  And I said that as an exaggeration because to make a point, obviously people know that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=278.44s)]
*  when I said that it was in jest. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=283.38s)]
*  But it was also said that it will be ended. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=286.04s)]
*  I was in jest. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  Now that I think about it, it is actually pretty funny that you would quickly solve [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=290.56s)]
*  this major crisis. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=294.24s)]
*  And then it was actually a joke. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=295.24s)]
*  I'm not actually gonna solve it anytime soon. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  And when I do, it's gonna be just taking whatever Russia says and being like, hey, Ukraine, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  do this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=302.48s)]
*  That's also in jest, I imagine. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=303.48s)]
*  Not super funny, maybe dark humor, I don't know. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=305.88s)]
*  But anyway, he apparently really did think that he would make progress, maybe not one [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=308.48s)]
*  day progress, but a little bit faster than three months. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  And he's apparently behind the scenes growing frustrated about how long this is taking. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=315.6s)]
*  And so in a moment, we'll turn to the actual deal, the peace plan he's put forward. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=320.8s)]
*  But let's talk just a little bit about where we are at. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=326.44s)]
*  We haven't talked about this topic in a while, Michael. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=328.76s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=330.36s)]
*  Well, I make exactly what, I mean, it's sort of predictable other than him calling out [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=331.36s)]
*  Putin. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=336.8s)]
*  But Donald Trump, when he talks about Crimea, and I know we'll get into that when we get [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=337.8s)]
*  into what the peace deal is. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=344.6s)]
*  And he said the most compelling thing that he said is he's blaming it on Obama. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=346.02000000000004s)]
*  So somehow, he can find an avenue to blame Obama for everything in the world that's bad, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=351.24s)]
*  and that's Crimea. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=358.0s)]
*  And then, that meant that's this Russian war as well. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=359.48s)]
*  So that's the thing that strikes me most about all of this. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  The fact that Trump is trying to criticize Putin because this happened on Easter, sort [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=366.12s)]
*  of showing himself to be this proud religious god. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=372.58s)]
*  How could you ever desecrate the most important holiday in the world to me is absurd, as is [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=375.9s)]
*  so much of what he says. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=384.78000000000003s)]
*  But I think that it's really important to look at, at least it is to me, the way that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  flip-flopping on something, cuz he doesn't know how to deal with Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=391.92s)]
*  I think, Johnny, you said it rightly at the beginning when he said you don't hear him [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=396.0s)]
*  call anybody else by their first names. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't send a text like that or a truth social like that to Netanyahu and say, come [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=402.72s)]
*  on, Benjamin, stop this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=408.54s)]
*  There's something about Vladimir Putin that puts him in a place that nobody else does. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=410.36s)]
*  And we can all have theories of what that is, doesn't matter. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  It's just that that is the disposition here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=418.56s)]
*  And him stepping in as a peacemaker or whether it's Wyckoff or whoever it is, it's not gonna [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=420.88s)]
*  make a difference because his allegiances are with one man, clearly. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=425.4s)]
*  Yeah, he's less peacemaker than just kind of acting Russian diplomat. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=430.04s)]
*  He's their ambassador to Ukraine, basically, delivering their terms. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=434.52s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=437.8s)]
*  Jordan, what do you think? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=438.8s)]
*  I think there's a couple things here. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=441.0s)]
*  As we've seen with tariffs and now we're seeing here, global leaders know they can just push [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=443.54s)]
*  Trump around. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=449.06s)]
*  While he acts like a strong man here and uses his power and throws it around domestically, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=450.06s)]
*  other leaders know that this guy doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=456.14s)]
*  He doesn't know what he's talking about. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=459.22s)]
*  And they don't really need to respect him. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=461.26s)]
*  We saw with China and tariffs specifically. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=463.98s)]
*  And this is just another instance where Trump is looking like a buffoon on a global stage [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=467.06s)]
*  while reassuring his base here that we're respected again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  And of course, we can see through that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=475.8s)]
*  But I also wanna think about this push to end this war and juxtapose that with the lack [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=477.52s)]
*  of a push, especially from the right to end the war in Gaza. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Michael, you pointed it out. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  He's not going to do that with Netanyahu. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  I think the reason here is that people value Ukrainian and European lives more than lives [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=492.28s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=499.06s)]
*  You're seeing a total disregard for the suffering in Gaza. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=500.22s)]
*  Chuck Grassley is calling for Trump right now to apply even more sanctions on Putin [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=505.74s)]
*  and Russia. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=512.22s)]
*  I mean, Russia is already heavily sanctioned and he wants more. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=513.22s)]
*  But he met with Netanyahu just a few months ago. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=516.94s)]
*  He's totally fine with everything that Netanyahu is doing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=518.98s)]
*  I think we need to take a second and think about why, when it comes to our foreign policy, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=521.38s)]
*  why we care about some victims and some innocent civilians that are dying and not others. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=526.18s)]
*  I think it's an important point that we need to center in these conversations. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=531.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a great point. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=534.42s)]
*  I think it's indisputable that that sort of dark, cruel calculus has been underlying the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=535.9s)]
*  last year and a half of that conflict, 100% true. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=541.14s)]
*  And also American foreign policy forever, right? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=543.78s)]
*  When it's convenient for us. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=546.42s)]
*  I just started a year or two ago. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=547.42s)]
*  Did? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=548.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=549.42s)]
*  You're 100% right. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=550.42s)]
*  I'm going back to the WrestleMania one day. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=551.42s)]
*  No, no, but I mean, there is a, I wouldn't even call it hypocritical. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=554.02s)]
*  They pick their battles and their battles are generally not the ones that have people [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=560.26s)]
*  in mind. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=565.9s)]
*  They have, whether it's petroleum or business interests or alliances. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=566.9s)]
*  In this case, it's pretty clear there's an otherism. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=572.22s)]
*  Yeah, and you mentioned what he had said about Crimea, that he sends these long true social [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=575.74s)]
*  posts way too long. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=580.98s)]
*  Donald, stop doing that. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=583.02s)]
*  Also everyone, don't do that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=584.3s)]
*  Don't send stuff like that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=585.78s)]
*  But anyway, he'll do this big block thing. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=586.78s)]
*  Half of it is Obama's responsible for Crimea. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=589.5s)]
*  No, what's the difference? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=592.42s)]
*  I literally don't even understand why you're so focused on this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=594.02s)]
*  He also says Obama, that was Obama's war, not Trump's, right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=597.46s)]
*  Or that was Obama's fault, not Trump's, right? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=602.16s)]
*  It's not Obama's or Trump's. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=605.86s)]
*  I'll give you a pass here, Don. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=607.74s)]
*  What happened in 2014 had nothing to do with either of you. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=609.26s)]
*  It was Putin, your buddy, going in and taking over Crimea. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=612.1s)]
*  Because as he said, most people there speak Russian. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=616.3000000000001s)]
*  Exactly, but I'm glad that he brought it up. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=618.58s)]
*  Because the reason he brings it up is to maintain this myth, this baseless myth that he never [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=621.3000000000001s)]
*  would have done it if it was me. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=627.9s)]
*  If I'd been in charge, he never would have invaded. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=630.02s)]
*  They would have never, Hamas would have never. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=632.5s)]
*  You know why? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=635.14s)]
*  Because Donald Trump just being in charge means all of you guys have to keep it cool, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=636.14s)]
*  Be chill, don't do anything crazy. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=640.74s)]
*  Because if you do, Donald Trump is gonna come down on you like a ton of bricks. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=642.9s)]
*  Except when Vladimir Putin in the middle of this peace process decides to kill a bunch [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=647.9s)]
*  of people on Easter, he didn't seem scared about what the consequences would be. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=651.86s)]
*  And evidently, why would he be? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=657.34s)]
*  You slaughter a bunch of people, you make a mockery of the peace process, and what does [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=659.14s)]
*  Donald Trump do? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=662.3s)]
*  No, Vlad, stop, he posts on social media, shouting into the digital void. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=663.66s)]
*  That's what would have stopped him from invading Crimea. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=669.62s)]
*  That's what would have stopped Hamas from attacking Israel. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=671.74s)]
*  No, he's gonna post on social media about me. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=674.22s)]
*  Yeah, I can see how that would maintain detente across the Earth's surface. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=677.3s)]
*  It's a ridiculous lie. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=682.1s)]
*  And nothing from him on JD Vance killing the Pope the day after. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=684.14s)]
*  Great point, an assassination on your watch. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=688.58s)]
*  But anyway, let's turn now to the actual deal. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=692.34s)]
*  So here is the agreement that Trump wants Ukraine to sign. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=696.2s)]
*  So Russia would keep almost all the land that it sees from Ukraine, about 20% of that entire [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=700.84s)]
*  country or what's left of the country after Crimea, obviously. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=706.24s)]
*  There's one little area that they would supposedly get back, but the vast majority of the territory [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=710.12s)]
*  would be taken from them. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=714.36s)]
*  Ukraine would be prevented from joining NATO. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=715.84s)]
*  So no defensive alliance that would help forestall a future invasion. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=719.4000000000001s)]
*  The US would recognize Crimea as part of Russia, in addition to all the territory that would [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  be stolen illegally through this peace plan. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=727.9599999999999s)]
*  They could theoretically join the EU. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=731.12s)]
*  Maybe it's a little bit vague on that, but again, no defensive alliances. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  There would be a security aid in funding, not from us. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=738.18s)]
*  We're not involved in it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=742.8399999999999s)]
*  There's literally no reference to the US. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  So somebody, I guess, the countries that are not even involved in this process, they're [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=745.3599999999999s)]
*  gonna have to foot the bill, I suppose. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=750.4399999999999s)]
*  And so you give Russia basically everything they want. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=753.2s)]
*  You say no NATO. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=756.88s)]
*  You give a very strong signal to Russia that we're not involved in this anymore. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=758.36s)]
*  You don't have to worry. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=762.44s)]
*  If you do decide to invade, we're not gonna do anything about it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=763.44s)]
*  And so this is basically just a guarantee that you'll have a little bit of peace, a [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=766.6400000000001s)]
*  month, six months, maybe two years, and then the invasion will continue. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  But Trump doesn't want you to see it that way. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=777.0400000000001s)]
*  He doesn't want you to see it as him just carrying the water for Vladimir Putin, which [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=778.44s)]
*  is objectively doing. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=781.8s)]
*  He actually says that Russia's making a very significant concession in this deal. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=783.5999999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=788.5999999999999s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, what concessions has [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=789.5999999999999s)]
*  Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=795.3199999999999s)]
*  the war, stopping taking the whole country. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=800.8s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=819.64s)]
*  Okay, so the concession Russia is making is that they only get to steal the territory [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  that they've conquered. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=831.7199999999999s)]
*  They don't get to steal territory that they're trying to conquer but have failed. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=832.9599999999999s)]
*  So Ukraine, which is nice of him, it's merciful. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=837.28s)]
*  You don't have to hand over the whole country right now. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=841.12s)]
*  You will eventually in a year or two, but for now, the territory they haven't successfully [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=843.88s)]
*  taken you don't have to give up. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=849.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's not even like Bizarro world. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=850.88s)]
*  That's a worm ate your brain logic. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=854.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't even understand it, but what do you think? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=855.68s)]
*  I mean, it's where this started, right? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=857.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's no difference. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=861.0s)]
*  It's like, okay, Russia can have Crimea. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the whole point of a lot of this fighting is for Russia to try and get Crimea. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=866.1999999999999s)]
*  It's not any kind of a deal and they're also saying it's an ultimatum. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=873.52s)]
*  If Zelensky walks away, there's gonna be no money for Ukraine from the United States. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=877.5999999999999s)]
*  So that's part of this conversation which puts a great deal of pressure on Europe, a [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=883.2s)]
*  great deal of pressure on parts of Asia as well. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=887.32s)]
*  It's the most foolish peace negotiation I've ever heard because you're saying, here's how [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  you have peace. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=897.4000000000001s)]
*  You have peace if you give them Crimea, which is why they invaded you in large part in the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=898.4000000000001s)]
*  first place. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=903.84s)]
*  So, okay, yeah, we know that we're fighting to protect it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=904.84s)]
*  We're fighting to protect our sovereignty. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  That's just the most absurd way of getting peace and I don't see how Zelensky. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=910.88s)]
*  The president said that he may see Zelensky when he's at Pope Francis' funeral on Saturday. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=915.28s)]
*  He left for Rome already. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=920.56s)]
*  He said that on the White House lawn, but may, I don't know. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=921.88s)]
*  I mean, what is he gonna tell Zelensky? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=925.16s)]
*  You better take this deal. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=926.96s)]
*  I have no clue. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=928.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=930.28s)]
*  I mean, neither Trump nor Biden really had any leverage over Putin here. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=932.04s)]
*  I'm routinely thinking about the progressives that tried to push the Biden administration [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=939.04s)]
*  to at least consider negotiations and diplomacy while Biden was in office. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=946.72s)]
*  Just make it part of the package. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=951.8s)]
*  Of course, still continue to send aid to Ukraine. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  They were screamed at, brow beaten into submission and rescinded this open letter. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=958.32s)]
*  The terms that we're seeing now in this deal and I'm with you, Michael. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=967.9200000000001s)]
*  It's like, how is this different than where we started? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=971.12s)]
*  I mean, the one thing that's different is many more people would still be alive. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=974.64s)]
*  There would be less bloodshed between when they raised that suggestion and now. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=978.08s)]
*  And to go back to the leverage point, I don't see how you're going to convince [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=983.9200000000001s)]
*  Putin to stop with any other deal. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=987.44s)]
*  What incentive does he have? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=991.12s)]
*  While there was a moment where it looked like Ukraine was holding strong and was pushing [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=992.48s)]
*  Russian forces back, it has not been the case in some time. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=997.9200000000001s)]
*  And this is not a war that Ukraine can actually win. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1002.32s)]
*  No matter how much money we throw at it, more and more people are going to die. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1007.2800000000001s)]
*  There will be more and more destruction at the end of the day. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1011.0400000000001s)]
*  You want to preserve as much of the country that is still standing as you can on the NATO thing. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1013.52s)]
*  The US, Germany and five other NATO countries already opposed Ukraine's membership in NATO. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1018.8s)]
*  So while Biden envisioned a long term plan where eventually Ukraine could be a member, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1026.56s)]
*  it wasn't on the table now. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1031.84s)]
*  So I keep thinking back, it seems like a missed opportunity to at least try [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1033.92s)]
*  to include some sort of diplomatic approach that the Biden administration just squandered. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1040.5600000000002s)]
*  And unfortunately, the right sees that opportunity in a very cynical fashion, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1046.16s)]
*  framed it a lot around the money we sent to Ukraine, just a pure dollars and cents game. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1051.44s)]
*  Framed it as government waste and whipped up fervor on the right in opposition to this war [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1057.8400000000001s)]
*  that I would have hoped the Democrats could have done. Unfortunately, it was all about [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1064.0800000000002s)]
*  fighting back. And the long term consequences, I think the Democrats are losing a firm footing [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1069.12s)]
*  in being the largely anti-war party. It's a very militaristic party and that's not the [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1076.3999999999999s)]
*  Democratic party. I think a lot of us want it to be. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1081.52s)]
*  Yeah, and these are strange conflicts for Democrats to stand up and because they, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1085.36s)]
*  Putin was pretty absolute that he wasn't going to talk to Biden about this. And he knows that he [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  can talk to Trump about it. And that's a huge advantage that Putin had with the election of [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1096.8s)]
*  Donald Trump in November. And as far as what happened in Gaza, yeah, it's a drop ball, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1101.6s)]
*  but it's also as we know, a very complicated, much more complicated conflict than were this [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1107.36s)]
*  to be happening between Paraguay and Bolivia right now. So it's, man, it's- [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1112.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes. Well, I agree, very difficult situation. You're in a tough spot when [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1118.08s)]
*  Vladimir Putin just decides, I literally do not care how many of my people die. I don't care how [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1124.0800000000002s)]
*  long this takes. I don't care how much money I have to put into it. I'm going to take this [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1128.24s)]
*  territory. That puts everybody in a very difficult position considering their military, obviously. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1131.44s)]
*  The idea that, again, it doesn't look like Ukraine is gonna accept this, even at effectively the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1137.2s)]
*  barrel of a gun. But the idea that if any of this goes through, Trump would claim to have been a [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1142.3200000000002s)]
*  peacemaker, yeah, it's easy to tell one side to surrender, I suppose. That doesn't seem that [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1147.68s)]
*  difficult. That's not the art of the deal. If he didn't come into Ukraine and be like, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1152.8s)]
*  give up Ukraine to Russia, and then, and we're also gonna steal Gaza. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1156.0s)]
*  I guess that ends a conflict. When you ethically cleanse the land, I guess there's less bloodshed [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1160.3999999999999s)]
*  afterward, I suppose. And then meanwhile, he's got this long list of countries that he wants to [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1165.6799999999998s)]
*  conquer and add to the American empire. So I agree with you, the Democrats have a lot of [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1172.1599999999999s)]
*  progress to make on these topics, but the Republicans, I mean, if they are claiming, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1176.8799999999999s)]
*  and they are, that they are somehow the party that's against war, they sure have some lofty [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1180.24s)]
*  imperial ambitions while they're doing it. And not to mention a legacy of being the party [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1185.28s)]
*  against Russia, which is all out the window right now. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1189.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, we're gonna play one more clip in a sec. First, though, I do wanna let you know [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1193.76s)]
*  about a poll that we have on the website right now. Should Ukraine have to surrender land [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1198.32s)]
*  to Russia? It's looking at this point like people are not really buying that. I mean, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1204.72s)]
*  obviously, surrender land is a broad thing, how much, where, that sort of thing. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1209.52s)]
*  But it looks like people are pretty clear about what they think about that for now. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1213.92s)]
*  I always wonder about this with polls, right? Where there's an I'm not sure. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1216.8s)]
*  Why are you filling out the poll? The most exciting thing about taking a poll is- [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1223.04s)]
*  No, I don't have a problem with I'm not sure. I think it's honest. I think we have- [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1227.12s)]
*  It is, but I have a problem too. It's honest, but I have a problem with you. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1232.08s)]
*  Stop sitting at the fence. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1235.6s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. The poll is not for the sitting. The poll is for the committed. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1236.64s)]
*  Well, why don't we jump into some other polls as presented classically as they have been on [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1240.8000000000002s)]
*  TYT recently by Harry and what do people think about Trump's approach to foreign policy? Take a [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1246.0s)]
*  look. Trump's net approval rating on foreign policy. You go back to January, the start of [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1250.16s)]
*  Trump's term. He was above water plus two points. Down he goes, down into the body of water, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1255.3600000000001s)]
*  underwater minus 13 points at this particular point. That is a drop of 15 points on the net [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1262.96s)]
*  approval rating since January. Foreign policy net approval at this point of presidency, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1268.96s)]
*  the average president plus 17. Trump in his first term, he was at minus 12, not particularly good. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1273.68s)]
*  And this is a good important reference. This isn't like a back to back terms. This is non-consecutive [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1280.16s)]
*  terms or first terms, which I think is obviously very important. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1285.3600000000001s)]
*  Correct. Minus 12 points there. That was the all time record for a presidency, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1288.32s)]
*  the 45th presidency of Donald Trump. You go to 47, he has broken his own record. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1292.8799999999999s)]
*  When it comes to Russia and Ukraine, the recent Fox News poll asked about his net approval rating [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1297.6799999999998s)]
*  on these different countries and where on Russia. Dealings with Russia, minus 18 points. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1302.8s)]
*  Dealings with Ukraine, minus 13 points. No doubt feelings towards Russia and Ukraine are impacting [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1307.84s)]
*  Trump's overall net approval rating on foreign policy. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1313.12s)]
*  That'll make sense. I think the graphs and all that very helpful. But for me to understand [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1316.08s)]
*  how it's changing over time, I really need you to drop it like it's hot. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1323.04s)]
*  I think that if you then I understand that things are going down, please jump if they go up. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1326.32s)]
*  Nothing really has. But anyway, so he's underwater. He's worse than he was in the first term. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1330.32s)]
*  That's all well and good. I think there's a case to be made that the fact that he's only [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1336.8s)]
*  negative 13 at this point, maybe should be seen as a win. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1341.68s)]
*  What has he accomplished in foreign policy so far? He started trade wars with the entire world [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1346.16s)]
*  that he had to in a humiliating fashion backtrack from. First, most countries, then on China, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1350.64s)]
*  making us look financially, economically way weaker around the globe than we already had. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1356.72s)]
*  He has promised to steal the land and deport the entire population of Gaza, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1360.96s)]
*  which would be one of the most heinous crimes against humanity of our lives. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1366.96s)]
*  And he said that he would cure the situation in Ukraine on day one and things have only gotten [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1372.0800000000002s)]
*  worse since then. So the fact that it's only dropped as much as it has, I think it could be [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1376.88s)]
*  worse if people were really paying attention, it might be. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1381.28s)]
*  Well, do you know how hard it is to piss off Canada? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1383.76s)]
*  That too. Yeah. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1386.96s)]
*  I don't know. He's certainly, we've closer ties with El Salvador in some ways, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1389.92s)]
*  at least than we did previously. But Jordan, what do you make of the polls? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1394.16s)]
*  I mean, he still has some support on other issues. I think it's misguided, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1398.8000000000002s)]
*  but I've seen some polls that unfortunately a good amount of 30 to 39 year olds [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1403.0400000000002s)]
*  he has a net support within that cohort, which is sad. And I think people are misguided. But [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1409.3600000000001s)]
*  on these specific issues, yeah, it's terrible. Because again, to go back to what I said earlier, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1415.6000000000001s)]
*  he doesn't know what he's doing. This guy is he's a moron. He's just like, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1419.44s)]
*  he so badly wants to be retired. He ran because of course he wanted to escape any sort of [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1424.48s)]
*  repercussions for his actions. But also he just likes the pomp and circumstance. He likes to feel [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1428.8s)]
*  important. And then he delegates the work to everyone else. He's not somebody who can actually [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1432.64s)]
*  negotiate these types of deals, these types of arrangements on a global stage. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1437.1200000000001s)]
*  But the hubris we're seeing from his campaign is just really shocking. I mean, as you saw this [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1442.0800000000002s)]
*  week, they're already selling Trump 2028 hats. Not only is it ridiculous, it's also unconstitutional. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1447.68s)]
*  So it shows that they don't really care. They're thinking long term. They're thinking perhaps [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1453.28s)]
*  violating the Constitution and keeping him in power. Who knows, but it's all just very, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1459.2s)]
*  very harrowing stuff. It's just disgusting. Yeah. Well, there's a lot more to discuss to you coming [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1463.6000000000001s)]
*  up on the show. Now, there's also some fun stuff too and maybe a little bit of stuff that'll give [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1470.3200000000002s)]
*  you some hope. We'll get to that on the other side of this break. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1473.68s)]
*  A new reporting coming out of both Politico and the Wall Street Journal. We have a little bit more [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1503.68s)]
*  clarity on the sort of state of mind of Pete Hegseth. A state of mind that over the last 10 [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1507.52s)]
*  years or so probably can rarely be described as clarity. But anyway, he's got a lot of chaos going [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1514.3200000000002s)]
*  on in the Pentagon. And he's increasingly worried about how that's gonna be perceived by the White [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1520.5600000000002s)]
*  House, in particular by Donald Trump, who doesn't necessarily like when one of his lackeys [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1525.28s)]
*  continually causes problems, makes things look like they're not going smoothly and also seems to [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1529.84s)]
*  be infested by leakers. And so Pete Hegseth is trying to get a handle on the situation. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1534.8799999999999s)]
*  He apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal, very concerned that he could be fired. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1541.4399999999998s)]
*  And in particular, he's worried that all of these leaks coming out could help lead to that [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1545.6799999999998s)]
*  situation. One leak in particular that we'll talk about being very high up on that list of concerns. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1550.48s)]
*  Apparently, every new leak of sensitive Pentagon operations or planning induce new concerns and [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1555.76s)]
*  fears in Hegseth. I don't know if that's just the leaks from other people or when he wakes up in [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1560.8s)]
*  the morning and realizes, God, I signaled again. I don't know if it's that sort of leak, but he has [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1566.8s)]
*  a lot to be concerned about. Apparently, once the Elon Musk China briefing came out, the leak [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1571.2s)]
*  revealing that Elon Musk was going behind Donald Trump's back and getting this secretive information [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1578.96s)]
*  that could potentially benefit him personally and financially. He yelled at Admiral Christopher [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1583.2s)]
*  Grady, I'll hook you up to an effing polygraph. That apparently did not actually happen, which as [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1587.52s)]
*  a leader, not a good call to be making threats if you're not gonna go through on them. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1594.56s)]
*  But he did go on to accuse a number of other people of the leak, including Lieutenant General [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1598.56s)]
*  Doug Simms, the Joint Staff Director, whom Hegseth also apparently threatened with a polygraph. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1603.76s)]
*  I don't know if that one actually happened, but it's not a good sign in your first 100 days in [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1610.08s)]
*  charge of an organization when you're going through the hallways yelling at people that you're gonna [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1614.56s)]
*  give them a lie detector test, at least I don't think. And so we've got the Elon Musk China [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1617.84s)]
*  briefing. That was a big leak. We had a Signalgate one, that was mostly Jeffrey Goldberg, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1622.88s)]
*  of course, who revealed that one. There was the second Signalgate scandal when we found out that [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1627.6s)]
*  he was sharing the same sort of classified sensitive information with his wife and his [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1632.88s)]
*  brother and his personal lawyer. Now, we also found out about a third signal issue, alleging [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1637.12s)]
*  that Hegseth had an unsecured internet connection on his personal computer that bypassed the Pentagon [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1642.56s)]
*  security protocols so that he could use Signal. This dude loves Signal more than I have ever loved [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1647.12s)]
*  an app in my life. And it might be his downfall. Dude, just uninstall it, try WhatsApp. Try the [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1653.28s)]
*  Messages app. They're perfectly good. You can leak all sorts of sensitive information. You [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1659.9199999999998s)]
*  can endanger the lives of our pilots on the iMessage or whatever. It doesn't have to be [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1663.44s)]
*  Signal. But anyway, there's other issues too floating around that we're gonna discuss. So [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1669.2s)]
*  he brings his wife to these sensitive meetings with foreign military officials. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1674.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm not gonna criticize Pete Hegseth over that. I don't even think it's his option. I don't think [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1677.8400000000001s)]
*  she's gonna let him be alone for more than a few minutes, considering all the allegations that have [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1681.76s)]
*  been flowing around. We found out that they spent something like, or they had plans to spend $40,000 [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1685.76s)]
*  setting up a makeup booth for Pete Hegseth in the Pentagon. And also that they'd been working on [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1690.88s)]
*  military plans for a takeover of the Panama Canal. And we come out of this with some staff still [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1696.96s)]
*  around, although they've been a bit shaken by the polygraph being waved in front of their face. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1702.64s)]
*  He doesn't have a chief of staff. He doesn't have a deputy chief of staff. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1707.6000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't have a senior advisor. So this isn't great at this point. I mean, we've seen this sort [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1710.8000000000002s)]
*  of chaos in the Trump White House before, but I feel like it took longer than 100 days the first [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1716.24s)]
*  time around. Yeah, I think it did actually take longer than 100 days. The other thing about Pete [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1720.4s)]
*  Hegseth is, first of all, if you're afraid of getting fired, you don't piss off the generals. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1724.4s)]
*  Because the generals are the ones that can put the pressure on to get you out of there. They can go [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1730.48s)]
*  to people who go to the president. It's not that difficult to make that happen. And so that's [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1737.1200000000001s)]
*  mistake number, it's a high number, but in this situation, it's a major mistake. So threatening [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1743.1200000000001s)]
*  these polygraph tests and threatening members of the uniformed military with them is the wrong way [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1749.6s)]
*  for the civilian leadership to go when it comes to the Pentagon. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1755.6799999999998s)]
*  The other thing about Hegseth is, and you think about this all the time, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1759.36s)]
*  had he not been confirmed, it would not have been the end of any Senate career. It would not have [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1763.1999999999998s)]
*  been the end of the president's mission, right? He would have put somebody else in there. This is [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1768.3999999999999s)]
*  all on the hands of the Republican senators who were too afraid to vote against the nominee of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1774.24s)]
*  the president. That it is a sickness in our politics that you cannot do that. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1779.28s)]
*  We would have another secretary of defense who would have gone through a rigorous [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1784.48s)]
*  hearing, who would have probably gotten every Republican to vote for them. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1788.24s)]
*  Maybe some Democrats because the Republicans would have already voted against Hegseth, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1792.08s)]
*  who's clearly not qualified. So it's time to have a little bit of spine when you're going up against [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1796.8799999999999s)]
*  these foolish nominees for a position. And Donald Trump would be on a plane to Russia, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1802.48s)]
*  rather to Italy right now to go to the funeral. He wouldn't be thinking about his secretary of [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1807.2s)]
*  defense. The Defense Department wouldn't be thinking about it. No Republican senator would think, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1813.8400000000001s)]
*  oh God, I'm still so upset about Hegseth not passing. It would have been in the wind, dust, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1818.64s)]
*  God. And that's the root of all this stuff. Yeah. Jordan? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1824.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking back to January 2024, when then Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1829.2800000000002s)]
*  went to the hospital and didn't disclose it for a few days. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1837.5200000000002s)]
*  And Trump and Republicans were calling for his removal from office. And while it's like, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1841.1200000000001s)]
*  kind of weird, you would want people, especially the president and others in the cabinet to know [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1847.2s)]
*  he's in the hospital. I don't know if it's as serious as Republicans tried to make it out to be. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1853.68s)]
*  And then you look at everything that Hegseth is doing, multiple unsecure signal chats, his [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1859.8400000000001s)]
*  personal cell phone and full name being used on an offshore betting site that is totally vulnerable, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1866.3200000000002s)]
*  allows foreign adversaries to easily access his information, his phone, his data, all of the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1873.8400000000001s)]
*  security risks that he is bringing on himself. To be clear, this isn't just like [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1881.2s)]
*  targeted attacks or targeted surveillance. He's just inviting it himself. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1889.28s)]
*  And to look at how they responded to Lloyd Austin, largely because he was just black. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1894.8s)]
*  That's why they didn't like him from the beginning because he was black. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1899.52s)]
*  And then you look at Hegseth, who is totally unqualified. And you could [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1902.4s)]
*  criticize Lloyd Austin for US foreign policy under his leadership. Of course, that's totally [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1906.48s)]
*  fair. But the knock on him was never about his race. It should never have been about his race. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1912.72s)]
*  And Pete Hegseth is somebody who doesn't deserve this position, only got it because he [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1918.96s)]
*  kissed Trump's ass on Fox News for years. And Trump saw him on the TV and liked him [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1923.3600000000001s)]
*  because he has a baby brain and that's how he operates. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1928.56s)]
*  And he's good looking. And he's good looking. And that matters to Donald Trump, seriously, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1930.88s)]
*  though. I mean, that is something, aesthetics matter more to this president than a lot of [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1936.08s)]
*  things. And Hegseth is the living example. And listen, I think Lloyd Austin was not [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1940.6399999999999s)]
*  above reproach. I think that that was a really bad thing he did when he didn't let anybody know [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1946.8s)]
*  that he went into the hospital. I don't know that it would have been grounds for removal. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1951.12s)]
*  Certainly grounds for criticism and investigation and a conversation. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1955.04s)]
*  And for the president to have reacted. But again, you're allowed to criticize. This guy has no [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1960.32s)]
*  business being at the Department of Defense. And the Republican senators knew it. If you [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1967.52s)]
*  went to them off the record and you asked them about it, they would have said, yeah, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1971.4399999999998s)]
*  this isn't a good pick, but we're gonna vote for him anyway. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1974.8s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. They went along with it and now it's causing all this trouble for them. And [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1977.12s)]
*  what do you get for the trouble? What's the advantage of Pete? I don't understand. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1982.8s)]
*  That's what I was saying. Especially when there were so many good alternative candidates, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1987.52s)]
*  hosting shows on Fox. You could add Deucey, you could add Killmeat and instead you wasted [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1993.04s)]
*  on this guy. I'll never understand it. But anyway. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1996.6399999999999s)]
*  Deucey was a nice guy when I was an NBC page. I'm digressing here for a second. He had a show [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=1999.52s)]
*  called House Party, which was a terrible show, but it required pages to seat the audience. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2003.6s)]
*  And I was one of the pages. And he was always very nice to the pages and very conversant. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2007.92s)]
*  And so Pete Deucey, when I see him on the road, when I first met him, I told him that story. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2012.6399999999999s)]
*  And he said, always when he sees me, we have nothing else to talk about. So he said, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2016.8s)]
*  I told my dad that story. I know you've told me 11 times you told your dad that story. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2020.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2025.44s)]
*  Interesting. In any event, one of the ways I'll end on this, Graphics 7, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2026.1599999999999s)]
*  one of the ways that they're trying to sort of rebuild Haggiseth's reputation back up is, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2030.08s)]
*  they're focused on building an aura around Haggiseth by pushing out videos of his memo [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2035.36s)]
*  signings and early morning workouts. Causing fears from current and former defense officials [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2039.9199999999998s)]
*  that some of the less photo worthy events could face delays because he's too busy having his [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2044.72s)]
*  photo taken. That'll definitely take eyes off the makeup booth story. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2048.96s)]
*  That you're doing all these workout fitness photos. But honestly, I want him to do as many [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2053.04s)]
*  of these as possible. Because if he's spending all of his time doing curls, getting that pump, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2059.12s)]
*  then he's not pursuing his lifelong quest to kill all the Muslims as he screamed once at a party. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2064.4s)]
*  And he's not trying to start a hot war with Iran or whatever. Because we cannot be distracted too [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2070.88s)]
*  much by all the shallow, dumb donkey stuff that he does. He's also on the substance, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2076.08s)]
*  to the extent that he ever thinks about the substance, he's terrible in that stuff too. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2082.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2086.08s)]
*  So anyway, we'll see what ends up happening with him. We do have a poll. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2088.0s)]
*  When he's on substance, you have to be careful that you're talking about substantive [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2090.7200000000003s)]
*  issues. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2096.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2096.8s)]
*  So we have a poll. How long will Hegseth keep his job? A week, a month, a year, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2097.76s)]
*  or he won't get fired, which is possible. Few people make it all the way in a Trump administration, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2102.96s)]
*  but I guess it could happen. People seem to think either he's sticking around or a month. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2107.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so that's not bad. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2111.84s)]
*  I'm gonna say I don't know. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2112.88s)]
*  I don't know. I have no idea. I will say though, I mean, I hadn't known about the gambling thing [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2114.96s)]
*  that Jordan mentioned. But with his gambling, with his substance abuse, with his allegations [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2121.2000000000003s)]
*  of sexual assault against him, the infidelity, his wild bizarre statements, and his complete [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2126.48s)]
*  lack of knowledge about what constitutes secure communications. Has there ever been a more readily [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2131.76s)]
*  blackmailable member of the US government than this guy? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2137.68s)]
*  Well, I'm a little resentful that you're lumping in gambling with those other horrible things. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2140.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying it's objectively bad. I'm saying it leads to people having bad things happen. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2149.04s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2153.52s)]
*  With the mob and such. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2154.02s)]
*  With the gambling and the drugs and the sexual assault. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2154.56s)]
*  I ranked them by how bad they are. It got progressively less bad. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2158.88s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2162.24s)]
*  But anyway, no, he's got a lot of issues. He's also an idiot and he really wants to be popular. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2163.12s)]
*  Welcome back one and all to what remains of the first hour. We've got two awesome stories [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2184.56s)]
*  to talk about and coming up after that we have Jorby. He's gonna be hanging around Jordan Yule. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2194.56s)]
*  Michael Short, you're also gonna be hanging around. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2201.12s)]
*  I am. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2202.56s)]
*  It's feeling less like a turnover to the second hour and more like I'm being kicked out is what [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2203.6s)]
*  it's feeling like. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2207.36s)]
*  Are you gone for the second hour? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2207.92s)]
*  Yes, Wazilambre will be replacing me. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2209.12s)]
*  Wow, look at that. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2210.96s)]
*  I'm gonna go hang with baby. But anyway, first let's hang with the news, starting with this. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2212.0s)]
*  George Santos was sentenced at long last earlier today and he got hit with a pretty [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2219.6s)]
*  hefty sentence. 87 months in prison, which most people would call that seven years. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2224.72s)]
*  I don't know why we talk about it in terms of months when it's baby ages [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2230.72s)]
*  and sentences. It's a lot of months basically. He pled guilty of course to charges of wire fraud [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2234.4s)]
*  and aggravated identity theft. That 87 months long is not only objectively a lot of time, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2240.56s)]
*  it's also the maximum possible. It's what prosecutors were seeking. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2246.64s)]
*  His attorneys had requested a two year sentence which would have been substantially smaller. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2250.96s)]
*  Now if you had like me sort of lost the plot of this whole thing a while ago, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2255.92s)]
*  he pled guilty last year to falsifying campaign records taken or done in order to obtain support [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2261.6s)]
*  from the National Republican Congressional Committee for a successful 2022 house campaign. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2267.76s)]
*  He initially pleaded guilty to the nearly two dozen federal criminal charges he was facing, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2273.0400000000004s)]
*  including conspiracy, false statements, credit card fraud, money laundering and theft of public [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2277.28s)]
*  funds. And as part of his plea deal, he admitted to a significant amount of the conduct for which [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2282.32s)]
*  he was charged, a reversal of his previous steadfast denials of wrongdoing. He eventually [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2287.6800000000003s)]
*  admitted that he did do it. Now despite the guilty plea, prosecutors made the case apparently [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2292.8s)]
*  successfully that he actually hadn't really taken responsibility for what he had done. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2298.6400000000003s)]
*  He wasn't really showing remorse. He did, obviously he did his press conference where he got all [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2303.52s)]
*  teary eyed and stuff. They implied that that was not genuine. They called him instead a pathological [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2309.28s)]
*  liar who is not at all remorseful for what he did. And one of the things that they used as a way to [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2314.1600000000003s)]
*  address that or sort of get it across was they pointed to the fact that he launched a weekly [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2320.7999999999997s)]
*  podcast called Pants on Fire with George Santos, which does seem to make light a little bit of [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2324.64s)]
*  the track record of lying or whatever. So that didn't help him. They basically said he's just [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2330.48s)]
*  trying to turn his notoriety into a grift, selling it in a variety of different ways. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2334.72s)]
*  And there is gonna be money involved in all this, but not going towards him instead coming from him. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2341.3599999999997s)]
*  He's gonna have to pay restitution of nearly $375,000 as well as forfeit more than $200,000 [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2346.8s)]
*  in ill-gotten gains. And so the only thing really remaining now is to find out whether he gets [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2353.76s)]
*  clemency or pardon. He has said that he hasn't reached out to Donald Trump, but he added that [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2359.44s)]
*  he believes quote, the president is aware of my situation. If he feels like I'm worthy of a [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2364.96s)]
*  commutation or of clemency or whatever the case is, he can make that decision. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2369.36s)]
*  And I have no idea if Donald Trump will give him a pardon. I will say we covered this morning on [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2374.0s)]
*  the damage report. There was this former Las Vegas councilwoman, I think she was? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2378.96s)]
*  Yeah, Michelle Fiore. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2383.2s)]
*  Michelle Fiore, who scammed a bunch of people, who donated money for a statue of two cops who [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2384.4s)]
*  were killed in the line of duty. She stole the money and instead spent it on a bunch of stuff, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2390.24s)]
*  including her daughter's wedding and plastic surgery. And Trump pardoned her, didn't even [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2394.8s)]
*  put out a statement. And she's never admitted that she was wrong. She's still saying that she [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2400.08s)]
*  never did it. And so he seems to be going around the country just finding grifters and conmen and [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2404.08s)]
*  frauds and pardoning them. And so I wouldn't rule out the possibility. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2409.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, she was a Vegas city commissioner. She was in the Nevada legislature and for sure was a big [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2413.7599999999998s)]
*  part because he rewards loyalty, fealty, all those things. I'm sure she was a reason that part of the [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2418.56s)]
*  army of people to get Donald Trump to win Nevada's electoral vote. So he repays favors in that way. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2426.0s)]
*  I don't think George Santos has done anything for him. The kind of pardon I could see possibly for [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2434.48s)]
*  Santos is if Trump thought this was excessive and then in two years, which is what Santos was asking [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2440.4s)]
*  for, in two years he would pardon him and have him released or commute his sentence. But I don't [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2446.2400000000002s)]
*  know also if those are federal, if they're all federal crimes, because some of them may be [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2452.8s)]
*  state crimes for which you cannot get a pardon. So I don't actually know all of that. I do know [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2458.08s)]
*  that Santos lied about having a family member who was in the Holocaust. He lied about working [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2463.76s)]
*  for Wall Street firms, lied about being on a volleyball team. He lied and lied and lied and [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2471.76s)]
*  never owned up to it. He spent the money on Botox in the last year where he was making money on [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2477.04s)]
*  Cameo and what had already been ordered to repay people who he had wronged. He was buying Rolexes, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2481.84s)]
*  getting Botox, buying clothing. This is not someone who is just oozing remorse. And I think that was [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2488.56s)]
*  the biggest part of what happened here. And he was expelled in a bipartisan way from Congress. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2494.88s)]
*  So that doesn't happen in a modern Congress anymore. So he was crying, he was devastated, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2499.52s)]
*  but he made his bet. And this is my one thing that I always say when I talk about George Santos. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2506.0s)]
*  Had the weekly newspaper in that area not had to close down, that story would have been reported [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2511.6s)]
*  when he was a candidate. And other national outlets would have found it out and they would [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2518.56s)]
*  have had the resources to look into it. But when we lose local news, we see the ascent of people [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2522.48s)]
*  like this. So it's really important to support local news. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2527.2s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2529.7599999999998s)]
*  Jordan? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2530.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point, Michael. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2531.6s)]
*  What do you think of the sentence, Jordan, too? Do you feel like seven years make sense? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2533.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2536.88s)]
*  Seven years, three months. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2539.12s)]
*  I mean, like what you were saying, he didn't show remorse. And this is not somebody who, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2541.04s)]
*  from what we can observe, feels bad about what he did. And, you know, in those moments, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2548.32s)]
*  like many of us struggle to find sympathy or feel sympathy for somebody who gets a harsh [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2557.2000000000003s)]
*  sentence like this. I mean, these types of sentences are rare for crimes like this. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2564.72s)]
*  You typically see longer sentences for violent crimes. Seven years for identity theft and fraud [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2569.68s)]
*  seems a little excessive, but I think it goes back to him not showing remorse. I don't know. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2576.72s)]
*  I'm kind of going both ways because I don't love how much the prison industrial complex is growing [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2583.9199999999996s)]
*  in this country. I think there are other remedies that we could evaluate. But then again, he was so [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2591.6s)]
*  brazen with it. He wasn't paying anyone back, so you kind of want to see the book thrown at him. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2596.64s)]
*  It's a moral dilemma. But I think on the pardon question, the only thing he has to offer Trump [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2602.48s)]
*  is just support, kissing up to him. He didn't really have any real power. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2610.4s)]
*  He doesn't really have any access. He doesn't have real wealth that Trump could benefit from [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2617.44s)]
*  if he were to pardon him. So it's really just, is Trump eventually going to feel bad for him? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2624.0s)]
*  That's the determining factor. Yeah. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. That's 100% right. I mean, that's exactly what it is. Is there sympathy within the man? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2631.84s)]
*  And I don't think it's going to happen. That's what I said, but I don't think it's going to happen [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2636.48s)]
*  for a while. And especially for someone who showed no- He has no constituency, right? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2640.4s)]
*  George Santos has nothing that helps Donald Trump, as Jordan said. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2645.52s)]
*  Yeah, unless Donald Trump has a completionist streak. I mean, apparently, he has already [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2648.64s)]
*  pardoned the majority of Republicans who've been convicted of crimes this century. He's just going [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2653.36s)]
*  to Duncan Hunter. Again, people who just defrauded Republicans, ripped Republicans off. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2658.96s)]
*  Right, but John, there are people lobbying the president and his chief of staff saying, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2664.88s)]
*  you gotta do this for Duncan Hunter. He was a great soldier in our army in the Republican [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2671.12s)]
*  House and all the things that we can't stand about him out the window. But there's nobody [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2675.2s)]
*  that's going to make the case for George Santos, except as Jordan said, if Trump in a moment of, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2680.8799999999997s)]
*  when they're talking about it in a moment of sympathy, Christmas of two years from now, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2686.96s)]
*  says, I'm going to pardon him. Okay. Well, I'm curious to see what the [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2693.4399999999996s)]
*  audience thinks about the sentence. We have a poll. Do you think this is a fair sentence? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2696.48s)]
*  And right now, the majority opinion is fair or not enough, actually. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2701.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. Not enough is interesting. That must have been before [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2707.4399999999996s)]
*  Jordan made his persuasive case, though. I think- [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2713.2799999999997s)]
*  Maybe that's true. We should probably update that. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2715.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Jordan's October surprise. Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2716.8799999999997s)]
*  Seven years is a long time. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2720.08s)]
*  I do think it's a long time. Especially when, I know his lies were about as brazen [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2721.4399999999996s)]
*  as any politician has had, and he scammed people. But Trump is the president. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2726.3199999999997s)]
*  Trump has lied tens of thousands of times. He has told absurd lies, and he has scammed [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2731.2s)]
*  more people than George Santos could ever fantasize about scamming. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2736.0s)]
*  There's no question. There's no question. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2739.12s)]
*  The meme coins, he has ruined countless followers of his, stolen every dollar they have. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2740.08s)]
*  And he's fine. He literally is having, some of the people who bought his meme coin, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2747.52s)]
*  he's bringing them on tours of the White House. He's pimping out government property from the [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2751.52s)]
*  con thing that he did. Madness, and he's totally free. Free George Santos, that's what I'm saying. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2757.6s)]
*  And then he can come on the show. I'm totally kidding. Seven years is fine. I really don't care. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2764.24s)]
*  I had forgotten he was still waiting to be sentenced. I thought he already went to prison, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2767.92s)]
*  honestly. I didn't really care about him. But anyway, with that said, why don't we turn [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2772.08s)]
*  to the Democrats, and we'll end on a little bit more of a positive note, perhaps, by jumping into [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2776.24s)]
*  this. I want everyday life to be better. That's what they want, too. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2779.8399999999997s)]
*  But importantly, all the controversies are over what that's like. Boy, you have good public transit [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2785.2s)]
*  to get to where you're going. And then when you get to that job, I want you to be paid well. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2789.8399999999997s)]
*  And if you're about to have a kid, I want you to know that you're going to have parental leave [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2793.12s)]
*  when you have that kid. And if you don't want to have a kid, I want you to have the right to choose [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2796.3999999999996s)]
*  whatever kid, which means access to birth control and abortion. And those things that give you the [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2800.24s)]
*  freedom to decide on that. That's the life I want everybody to be able to live. And I think we can [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2804.64s)]
*  deliver that. So that is Pete Buttigieg, obviously, on the Andrew Schultz podcast, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2809.04s)]
*  and his appearance has gone viral. What he said there, I think, makes perfect sense. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2817.6s)]
*  It is good messaging. And I don't understand why it went viral. It doesn't seem like much. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2822.56s)]
*  Am I the bad guy here? No problem with Pete Buttigieg. I like Democrats going out and doing [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2828.08s)]
*  good messaging. And he's got a good vibe with them and everything. But I don't know what was [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2831.7599999999998s)]
*  the hard hitting thing that he said. Part of his issue as a candidate was always that he wasn't [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2836.24s)]
*  really a viral type of personality at a time of virality. So yeah, maybe the beard is what's [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2842.16s)]
*  sending a vibe. Maybe, maybe he looks tan. He's got the beard. He didn't do a tie or whatever. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2850.64s)]
*  All of these are just, he just did it. He didn't consciously decide on any of this. But anyway, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2854.8799999999997s)]
*  I have no problem with anything that he said there. And I think he's done a much better job [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2859.52s)]
*  for himself of the viral stuff over the past couple years. Like he's gone on Fox News. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2863.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. He did that a bunch of times. And I thought he was quite good in those appearances. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2867.36s)]
*  So I'm not trying to hate him. Sometimes I don't understand why some things break through and [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2872.08s)]
*  others don't. But that said, we're gonna get a little bit more of what he had to say on the [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2876.16s)]
*  podcast. And then I wanna hear what Jordan has to say about this. And if you already have a kid, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2880.08s)]
*  when you picked him up at school, I want that school to be good, not having his funding slashed [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2884.32s)]
*  while they set fire to the Department of Education. And then when you get home, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2887.52s)]
*  I want you to be in a neighborhood that is safe and where you can breathe the air because we [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2891.04s)]
*  didn't let them get rid of the Clean Air Act. And you don't have to think for one moment [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2895.6s)]
*  about whether the air you breathe or the water you drink is clean and clear, which actually takes [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2900.32s)]
*  a lot because it means the government has to constrain those actors that would make you [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2903.92s)]
*  unfree by polluting the air and polluting the water. And then when you go to bed, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2908.56s)]
*  I want you to know that your family's gonna be fine, even if it's family like mine, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2912.32s)]
*  despite there being some Supreme Court justice who wants to obliterate your family cuz it doesn't [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2916.0s)]
*  match his interpretation of his religion. That's the life I want everybody to be able to live. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2921.28s)]
*  Yeah. So everything he said there was very well received by those guys. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2925.6s)]
*  And again, I don't have any problem with anything he said. It seemed like a very basic description [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2930.72s)]
*  of just like, let's set up the system so that people aren't crushed under government, but also [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2935.36s)]
*  not crushed by corporations. I understand it's being pitched as, hey, it's common sense. But yeah, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2940.48s)]
*  but is that it? I don't understand. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2944.8s)]
*  So maybe Jordan, maybe you can explain why do you think this has broken through in this [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2966.5600000000004s)]
*  particular way and what do you make of it? Easily, it's where he's saying it. That's it. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2969.92s)]
*  You guys brought up the Fox, you brought up the Fox clips, those went viral because of where he [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2974.8s)]
*  was saying it. If he goes and says that on MSNBC, no one's gonna share it cuz yeah, he's just [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2978.32s)]
*  preaching to the choir. But he goes into hostile territory on Fox. He makes his case persuasively. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2982.4s)]
*  People like it because they know not just them, but everyone else watching it. And the majority [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2988.8s)]
*  of Fox viewers are right wingers. They're hearing something different. It's counter programming. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2994.08s)]
*  This, this show was one of the more influential shows during the election. You had this long [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=2999.2s)]
*  conversation after Trump wins. Hey, whoa, the right is dominating the new media space. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3003.76s)]
*  Okay, so the answer is, and I think what he's doing differently is he's going into those spaces [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3010.7200000000003s)]
*  and making his case firmly. He's not doing what people like Gavin Newsom are doing and having the [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3016.1600000000003s)]
*  right on his shows. People don't care what Steve Bannon thinks and people don't wanna see you [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3022.6400000000003s)]
*  cozying up to Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk. But what they see here is Pete going on, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3028.72s)]
*  standing his ground, not caving and finding room for agreement with right wing positions [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3035.68s)]
*  on shows like Flagrant. He's going on and sticking to his guns and people like that. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3041.68s)]
*  That's why I think it's gaining traction because they know it's a hostile space. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3046.8799999999997s)]
*  And the hosts were all in agreement with them. And for them, these aren't politics first guys. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3052.3999999999996s)]
*  These are comedians and pop culture commentators. But they have routinely had right wing guests on [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3057.68s)]
*  who push right wing talking points and a right wing agenda. Then they find, hey, you know what? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3066.08s)]
*  I don't agree or I don't disagree with what Democrats or liberals like Pete Buttigieg is [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3071.7599999999998s)]
*  saying. In one of his clips, Andrew Schultz was agreeing so much. He's like, look at us, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3078.16s)]
*  we're turning into a bunch of libs. So it's important that people go on to these shows and [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3082.4s)]
*  into these spaces and make your case. And the best way of doing it is to stay firm in your [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3088.48s)]
*  positions, not go on and be like, I agree with you on this right wing culture war issue or I agree [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3092.96s)]
*  with you on that issue. Go on and stay firm. That's what people wanna see. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3098.08s)]
*  Okay, good. That's a very helpful explanation. I'm glad I don't know much about their politics. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3101.6800000000003s)]
*  And so I suppose, based on what you're saying, it's not a message where I'm the audience for it. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3106.48s)]
*  The expectation would be that I need to hear that and that's fine. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3111.12s)]
*  Tailor your message to where you go. And again, like I said, I got no disagreement with anything [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3113.92s)]
*  he said there. Just didn't really understand exactly what was breaking through the way that it did. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3118.16s)]
*  Yeah, Jordan answered. I mean, because of where he went. Even though I don't know who those people [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3121.2s)]
*  are either. So it wouldn't have gone viral in my house, but they weren't talking about gambling or [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3125.36s)]
*  hockey or anything anyway. So wouldn't have. But yeah, and I think that just in the Newsome [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3130.88s)]
*  conversation a little bit different just because he's the governor still. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3138.56s)]
*  And I think if he goes into other people's, although it's not an excuse, he should still do [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3141.7599999999998s)]
*  it. But if he goes on to other people's shows, it becomes the dynamic changes. It'll be interesting [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3146.32s)]
*  is what I guess I'm saying. To see when his gubernatorial term ends. If he does do more of [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3152.32s)]
*  the stuff that you see Buttigieg doing here going into hostile territory rather than have hostile [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3158.08s)]
*  people that we don't care about coming into his territory. So I wonder if it's just because he's [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3162.7999999999997s)]
*  a governor. I don't know. I don't know the answer to it, but I'm musing aloud. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3167.12s)]
*  That is interesting. Here's what I'd like to do. Can we take one minute? Can we just play the last [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3170.56s)]
*  video, D4, and get quick responses? Cuz this video has generated a lot of headlines too in [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3176.7999999999997s)]
*  a slightly different way. It's very different than the Pete Buttigieg thing. Let's play this [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3182.24s)]
*  and then see what the guys think. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3184.88s)]
*  I am so touched being here. I'm a girl from the Bronx. To be welcomed here in this state, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3185.76s)]
*  all of us together, seeing our common cause, this is what this country is all about. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3197.28s)]
*  Don't let them trick us into thinking we are enemies. Don't let them trick us into thinking [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3203.36s)]
*  we can be separated into rural and urban, black and white and Latino. We are one. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3209.28s)]
*  Miracles start with mustard seeds. And that is what each and every one of you [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3215.0400000000004s)]
*  represent today. Small miracles of faith in ourselves, in each other, and in the refusal [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3221.6800000000003s)]
*  to give up. The main reason I wanted to play that was there were headlines going around, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3229.92s)]
*  I think on the hill where it's like AOC releases presidential style video. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3234.96s)]
*  I was like, it's clickbait. It's just a video to promote the Fight the Oligarchy Tour. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3239.12s)]
*  And then I watched it and I was like, yeah, no, it does kind of feel like- [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3244.96s)]
*  It does. It also doesn't seem any different than, I mean, kudos to what they're doing out there. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3247.84s)]
*  I think it's great at keeping people excited, interested, and engaged, super important. And [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3252.4s)]
*  these are two very, very impressive people. But what she said in that video, as good as it was, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3256.56s)]
*  is no different than what Kamala Harris said in her videos in 2024. And so, yeah, it's exciting [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3262.8s)]
*  and it's good. And again, I'm so happy that people are getting people excited and remaining [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3270.6400000000003s)]
*  interested. I think that's super important. I don't know if Nampa, Idaho, but of course, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3277.6000000000004s)]
*  it's a 50 state country until Canada shows up. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3282.6400000000003s)]
*  Jordan, what did you think and would you have liked that same message [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3286.2400000000002s)]
*  better if it was delivered in a right wing podcast? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3290.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3292.96s)]
*  But you know, it's like all my media consumption, so I didn't hear it for the first time. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3294.8s)]
*  That's why you wear the golf shirts, right? So you can fit it. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3300.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. No, it's fine. I definitely see how it was like, it had the appearance and tone of a [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3303.6800000000003s)]
*  potential 2028 ad, just planting the seed, a mustard seed, if you will. But again, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3312.88s)]
*  like that, I think it's important to talk about like, it's about where you're saying these things [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3319.36s)]
*  and she's in Idaho. And you have like, you have people like Alyssa Slotkin who are saying, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3324.4s)]
*  Democrats need to stop using the term oligarchy. No one knows what it means. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3328.56s)]
*  You have an arena in Idaho filled to the brim with people under the banner of fight the oligarchy. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3332.6400000000003s)]
*  Like what Michael is saying, like what they're doing is impressive right now, both Pete going [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3340.6400000000003s)]
*  out and being a clear messenger and also AOC and Sanders filling arenas in red and purple states [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3345.28s)]
*  under this banner. They are forcing a conversation about political dynamics [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3351.92s)]
*  and wealth disparity and who controls power in this country that is absolutely essential. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3356.88s)]
*  And all Democrats would be wise to get behind them because what they're seeing [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3362.0800000000004s)]
*  is the beginning of a movement that they can ride into the midterms and ultimately 2028. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3366.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, or for establishment Democrats pay attention to this so that you can desperately [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3372.08s)]
*  try to stop it and doom Democratic chances in the midterms in 2028. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3376.24s)]
*  Well, okay, that's a different conversation. But yeah, I know what you're saying, John. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3380.0s)]
*  They have to take this message and get white working voters, male union members and voters back, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3385.92s)]
*  which Sanders is very good at. And I don't know that representative [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3392.0s)]
*  Casio-Cortez is but we'll see. I hope that we will. Okay, well, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3395.04s)]
*  gentlemen, thank you. Jordan would have been nice if you could have come in. I'm kidding. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3398.96s)]
*  But anyway, always good to see you. Thank you for joining us on the show. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3403.12s)]
*  I'm bookending Jordan with a little. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3405.92s)]
*  Are you gonna get closer to the camera now? I'm kidding. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3408.7200000000003s)]
*  I've got to be with him for another hour and a half. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3410.88s)]
*  That's true. I got to remember the- [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3412.64s)]
*  Well, anyway, and Michael, always good to see you here as well. For those of you in the audience, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3415.68s)]
*  you are lucky because you get a whole nother hour of these guys and Wasney Lambert as well. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3419.76s)]
*  What's that? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3425.92s)]
*  It's Ben. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3426.32s)]
*  Ben is gonna be joining us. Okay, the document had not been, it still says Was. Anyway, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3428.16s)]
*  I apologize. I am once again spreading misinformation, this time not about vaccines, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3432.56s)]
*  so I think we're okay. Anyway, we'll see you after this break. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0h05VC_MkU&t=3437.12s)]
