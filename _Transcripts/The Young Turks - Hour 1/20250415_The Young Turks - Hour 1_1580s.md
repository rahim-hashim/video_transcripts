# TYT HAS THE RECEIPTS: Trump Admin Is SPREADING LIES About Deported Maryland Man
**The Young Turks - Hour 1:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw)
*  But the reality is this wasn't a Maryland father. This was a El Salvadorian man who was illegally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=0.0s)]
*  in this country who was affiliated with MS-13. Let's set the record straight about who this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=6.08s)]
*  person is. There's no evidence that he was a gay member. He's an illegal immigrant. He was here [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=12.24s)]
*  illegally with deportation orders in 2019. What part of that do you not understand? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=17.04s)]
*  I understand the story very well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=21.84s)]
*  All right, so that was last night on News Nation and that was anchor Hina Doeba. And they had a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=23.92s)]
*  fiery confrontation with White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Field. So the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=31.76s)]
*  two were going back and forth over the allegations that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=37.68s)]
*  So Cenk, we have a lot more of that News Nation interview to show the audience, but how do you [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  think this is gonna go? It already seems very contentious. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=49.52s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciated that a little bit of a throw down there from the anchor not taking the lies of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=53.440000000000005s)]
*  the Republican. And they are, they're huge, huge lies. Tons of Republicans and right-wing hosts [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=58.64s)]
*  are pushing out these lies. So we're gonna show you the reality here. We're gonna show you the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  receipts and we're gonna show you what this guy actually is and what the courts have decided. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=68.08s)]
*  And we'll show you court documents about it. Actual receipts here instead of just [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=74.4s)]
*  nonsense jibber jabber from the other side. So find out for yourself, but let's watch a little [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=78.8s)]
*  bit more and let's see all the details and facts here. Then I'll weigh in more. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=85.28s)]
*  Right, so we definitely have those receipts and we will get to them. But yeah, first let's go [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=88.8s)]
*  to the clips. We have two clips to show you from that News Nation confrontation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  In this first clip, Doeba and Fields are battling over whether or not Abrego Garcia [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=98.72s)]
*  was actually affiliated with or a part of MS-13. Take a look. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=103.2s)]
*  But the reality is this wasn't a Maryland father. This was a El Salvadorian man [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=108.88s)]
*  who was illegally in this country who was affiliated with MS-13. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=113.84s)]
*  There is no evidence to that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=118.32s)]
*  Let's set the record straight about who this person is. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=119.36s)]
*  There's no evidence that he was a gang member. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=121.52s)]
*  With all due respect, if you, the Department of Justice has come out and said [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=122.88s)]
*  that he has gang affiliation. So instead of defending this gentleman, talk about who he [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=128.48s)]
*  actually is and talk about the risk in keeping illegal criminals in this country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=133.76s)]
*  This is exactly what President Trump was elected to do, to return these people back to their home [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=138.72s)]
*  countries and that's what he did. We're not defending him. I'm going to reiterate that is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=142.88s)]
*  unsubstantiated. There is no evidence of him being a gang member. He was married to, he is married to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=146.72s)]
*  a US citizen and he was in this country legally. Okay, but we don't know if he was actually- [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  Being married does not make you not a gang member. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  There's no evidence. We're gonna move on. There's no evidence that he was a gang member. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  And I want to reiterate that to our viewers. The Department of Justice came out and said there was [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=163.36s)]
*  credible evidence that he was a member or affiliated with MS-13. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=166.24s)]
*  You said he's a gang member and he wasn't legally allowed to be here, which again, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  he was legally allowed to be here and he is married to an American citizen. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=172.96s)]
*  You can report from all you want. He's no longer in this country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=176.96s)]
*  All right. The Americans are safer because of it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=179.84s)]
*  All right, so Doe Wittenfield then fought over [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=185.52s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's immigration status more specifically. So let's look at that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=188.16s)]
*  So right now the White House seems to be doing nothing about getting him back and that's fine. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=192.0s)]
*  I'm going to move on. He's an illegal immigrant. He was here illegally with deportation orders [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=196.8s)]
*  in 2019. What part of that do you not understand? I understand the story very well and I'm gonna [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=202.48s)]
*  stop going back and forth with you on this. But I will say again, he had every right to be in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=208.0s)]
*  this country. Is there any scenario under which this guy- [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=212.24s)]
*  He did not. He was an illegal immigrant. We're gonna move on on this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=215.04s)]
*  No, I will not let you go forward. He was an illegal alien in this country [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=217.52s)]
*  with a deportation order in 2019. He is an El Salvadorian citizen. If you are not a citizen [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  of the United States of America here illegally, there are grounds to deport you in which happened [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=227.68s)]
*  recently. Again, those are the facts. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=233.36s)]
*  Those are not the facts, but I will move on. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=236.4s)]
*  Okay, so here is what has actually been stated in court. Abrego Garcia did grow up in El Salvador's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  capital city according to the court documents. His family had been targeted and harassed by a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=246.88s)]
*  local gang there named Barrio 18. So here's some reporting from AP News on that. When Abrego [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  Garcia was 12, the gang threatened to take him away until his father paid them all of the money [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=258.08s)]
*  that they wanted. The family moved 10 minutes away, but the gang threatened to rape and kill [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's sisters court record state. So per the court records, Abrego Garcia's family [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=269.36s)]
*  could not go to the authorities because of police corruption, which does track. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=275.44s)]
*  So the family tried to flee to Guatemala instead, but even after moving to Guatemala, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=280.16s)]
*  they were still tortured and tormented by the gang. So Abrego Garcia fled to the US illegally [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=285.36s)]
*  around 2011, the year he turned 16 according to documents filed in his immigration case. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=291.68s)]
*  And in 2019, he went to a Home Depot looking for work when he was arrested by county police, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=297.76s)]
*  according to court filings. Detectives asked if he was a gang member. So after explaining that he [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=304.8s)]
*  wasn't, he was detained by ICE. And that brings us up there. So Abrego Garcia asked to be released [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=310.32s)]
*  and told an immigration judge that he would seek asylum. So this is more reporting. US ICE, however, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=317.68s)]
*  alleged that he was a certified gang member based on information that came from a confidential [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=324.16s)]
*  informant used by county police record state. According to Abrego Garcia's attorneys in his [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=330.16s)]
*  current case, the criminal informant had alleged that Abrego Garcia belonged to an MS-13 chapter [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  in New York where he has never lived. The information was enough for an immigration [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=343.44000000000005s)]
*  judge in 2019 to keep Abrego Garcia in jail as his immigration case continued, court records state. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=348.56s)]
*  The judge said the informant was proven and reliable and had verified his gang membership [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=355.92s)]
*  and rank. All right, so in October of 2019 now, an immigrant judge in Maryland granted Abrego [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  Garcia protection from getting deported to El Salvador due to a well-founded fear of gang [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=367.68s)]
*  persecution. However, his asylum request was denied by that same judge because he did not file it [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=373.36s)]
*  quickly enough. Abrego Garcia was then released from custody and ICE did not appeal. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=379.52s)]
*  So here's more reporting. Abrego Garcia checked in with ICE yearly while the Department of Homeland [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=384.96s)]
*  Security issued him a work permit, his attorney said in the filings. He joined a union and was [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=390.24s)]
*  employed full-time as a sheet metal apprentice. So he was never charged with or convicted of being [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  a member of MS-13. At no point was he convicted of this. This year, district judge Paula Zinnis [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=402.64s)]
*  wrote in a court filing that the quote unquote evidence against Abrego Garcia [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=408.96s)]
*  consisted of nothing more than his Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie and a vague uncorroborated [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=413.52s)]
*  allegation from a confidential informant claiming he belonged to MS-13's Western Click in New York, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=419.84s)]
*  again, a place he has never lived. And yet, this is what our vice president, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=426.64s)]
*  JD Vance posted this morning on social media. He said the entire American media and left wing [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=432.24s)]
*  industrial complex has decided that the most important issue today is that Trump [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=437.92s)]
*  is that the Trump administration deported an MS-13 gang member and illegal alien, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=443.44s)]
*  but that's not true. It's just not true, even though it's on truth social. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=448.72s)]
*  So in a truth social post last night, President Donald Trump called Abrego Garcia, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=452.72s)]
*  an MS-13 gang member and foreign terrorist from El Salvador. So now the question is, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  what are the Democrats doing about all of this? It's kind of interesting, actually. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=463.68s)]
*  A group of Democratic senators led by Senator Chris Van Hollen could actually be traveling to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=467.76s)]
*  El Salvador later this week if Abrego Garcia is not released by then. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=473.76s)]
*  Van Hollen wants to check on Abrego Garcia's condition and discuss his release with the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  government of El Salvador. Also, Representative Maxwell Frost pledged his support as well, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=483.52s)]
*  and he stated that he would attempt to bring along other members of the House. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=489.04s)]
*  And speaking of the House, last night Jen Psaki asked Hakeem Jeffries what Democrats can do to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=493.84s)]
*  help bring Abrego Garcia home. And here is Jeffries answer. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  What if any power for people who are watching at home, what power do you have in other Democratic [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=503.52s)]
*  members to compel, push the government to bring them home? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=510.32s)]
*  Well, we have the power to shape public sentiment and at the end of the day, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=514.16s)]
*  making sure that public sentiment in this case understands that the treatment of Mr. Abrego Garcia [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=521.6s)]
*  is unconscionable, unacceptable and un-American. And if it can happen here, it can happen anywhere. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=529.92s)]
*  Well, that is a lackluster response from Jeffries. If our congresspeople are just [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=535.92s)]
*  trying to sway public opinion, they're not doing a whole lot. They're the ones who actually have [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  the power to do something. Whereas people like us, we're the ones who are trying to sway public [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  opinion in one way or another. And everybody on social media and people just talking to their [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  relatives, that's how those things happen. We need a little bit more from our congresspeople. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  But Jen, you know what's crazy to me is that instead of just admitting that their [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=560.0s)]
*  poorly executed plan inevitably resulted in the wrongful deportation of this man. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=564.32s)]
*  Instead, they're just going to criminalize him even further and demonize him in the press and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  say no, no, no, we were right. This man wasn't supposed to be here in the first place, even though [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=573.6s)]
*  again, as we just showed our audience, the evidence does not support that. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=578.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's two reasons why the Republicans are doing this. There's so much to discuss here. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=581.7600000000001s)]
*  So first reason is Trump's insecurities. So if he made the decision to send this guy down there [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=586.88s)]
*  without due process and without checking, then it must be the correct decision. And we don't care [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=593.92s)]
*  that he's innocent and we don't care what the courts say. We're just gonna keep him down there [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=598.56s)]
*  in the dungeon. Okay, that's Trump 101. Number two is they pick these fights, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=602.7199999999999s)]
*  but they need the left wing to fight back. And if you're just deporting [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=608.4s)]
*  criminal undocumented folks, there isn't gonna be much pushback because most of the country agrees [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=612.56s)]
*  with that, right? So they need something that creates controversy. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=619.12s)]
*  So in order to create controversy, they purposely lie, therefore getting the left wing, etc. to fight [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=624.32s)]
*  back. And then they pretend to their own voters, my God, you see that? The left wing loves these [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=631.2s)]
*  undocumented criminals and they wanna keep the rapists and the murderers and the MS-13 gang guys. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=639.2s)]
*  You see that? And so, and unfortunately, this is an enormous part of the puzzle. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=646.4s)]
*  Right wing media in general helps them and they lie along with the Republican politicians [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=652.4s)]
*  and the Trump administration. So that their audience thinks the guy really is MS-13 [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=659.92s)]
*  and must have committed some grave offense cuz they saw JD Vance tweet about it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=665.84s)]
*  They saw Donald Trump say it. Now all their right wing media agrees, well, then it must be true. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=670.48s)]
*  And by the way, guys, unlike a lot of folks on the left, I don't blame those viewers, voters, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=675.76s)]
*  etc. Cuz they were lied to and they don't know that they're being lied to. Some of them do know [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=682.32s)]
*  and some of them will say on social media, I don't care. I don't care. And he's not a citizen, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  just do whatever you want with him. You sent him to a dungeon, torture him. I don't care, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=694.4000000000001s)]
*  he did something, he didn't do something, he was a criminal, he's not in a gang, I don't care, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=700.0s)]
*  right? And some say as long as he's undocumented, which is true, then again, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=704.0s)]
*  then he deserves every fate that he gets. And he was afraid that he was going to be [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=710.24s)]
*  attacked, possibly killed by the gangs in El Salvador that are in that prison. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=716.0s)]
*  That might kill him. That's why our judges said don't send him to El Salvador, right? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=722.56s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, but as long as he was undocumented, I don't care. So that portion exists. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=731.04s)]
*  But a bigger portion got lied to and has no idea what the reality is. Look, I know that he has just [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=735.12s)]
*  broke it down for you guys, but I wanna summarize real quick. So if you say he's [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  undocumented, no problem, he was undocumented. Okay, and you saw the reasons why. If you say [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  that he was part of MS-13, how much clearer does it have to be that he wasn't? So some [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=749.84s)]
*  informant, obviously lying, said, yeah, he was an MS-13 in New York. He hasn't been in New York. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=757.36s)]
*  He lives in Maryland, has nothing to do with New York. And an informant saying that he was an MS-13 [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=763.04s)]
*  to get a lenient sentence or whatever reason that he said it so that he could skate in an innocent [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=769.04s)]
*  guy can go to jail or be deported. Wow, that would be shocking. But again, if you saw the court paper [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=773.9200000000001s)]
*  because they copy and pasted it, an earlier court hearing where someone alleged that he was MS-13, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=779.44s)]
*  I get why you were misled, I get it. But we're showing you here, later court proceedings in 2019, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=787.5200000000001s)]
*  or showed that he was not an MS-13 that made up allegation. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=794.0s)]
*  But in fact, he was legitimately scared to death that if he sent back to El Salvador, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=800.48s)]
*  that those gangs are the ones that would actually threaten him and potentially kill him. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=806.88s)]
*  And if you say, I don't care, now that I know the truth, I still don't care. Well, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=811.68s)]
*  I'm not gonna be able to convince you. And so you're a person who just doesn't care about others and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=816.4s)]
*  doesn't have any empathy, etc. And I can't ever reach you, because the minute you view someone in [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=820.88s)]
*  a different category, then you think the worst things in the world can happen to them. They can [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=825.84s)]
*  get slaughtered by those same MS-13 gang that I claim that I hate, as long as it's not me. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=830.64s)]
*  It's I don't identify with a guy, I don't care. Okay, that group, you can't ever get them to say, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=836.0s)]
*  yeah, we should all treat all human beings the same way, etc, etc. But if you're in the larger [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=842.4s)]
*  group, look, I don't know that a lot of you are gonna see this video, you're gonna see our [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=847.6s)]
*  posts on social media, etc. But if you're in that group, you should ask the right wing media and [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=853.76s)]
*  your politicians. And we do it here on The Young Turks, we do it to Democrats all the time. We get [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=859.76s)]
*  tons of flak for it, right? But if you're on the right wing and you're honest, you should ask them, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=864.88s)]
*  hey, why did you tell me he was an MS-13? Well, later courts thought that was garbage and didn't [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=868.96s)]
*  think he was an MS-13. And that guy you saw, Harrison Fields, the White House principal deputy [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=874.96s)]
*  press secretary that we showed you in that News Nation clip. He said that in 2019, there were [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=881.2s)]
*  deportation orders against them, when in reality, it was the exact opposite. In 2019, the court ruled, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=886.88s)]
*  you cannot deport him. So he's 100% lying. And see, unlike a viewer or a voter that might [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=894.0s)]
*  have heard it somewhere online or in media or whatever, that guy knows, he knows for sure. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  And JD Vance knows for sure that they're lying. But hey, we wanna trick people into thinking that [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=909.76s)]
*  left wing loves criminals, loves MS-13 gang, and we don't mind lying. And then JD Vance said it [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  about the cats and dogs. And it went challenging in an interview. He said, look, that might not be [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=923.36s)]
*  true to something, words along those lines, but I had to bring your attention to this other issue [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=928.72s)]
*  about gangs in Ohio and undocumented people, etc. So basically admitted, yeah, we lie in order to [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=933.84s)]
*  get attention to a cause that we want. But you don't need to lie. Deporting undocumented [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=941.52s)]
*  criminals who are part of MS-13 is already intensely popular. In fact, if you're in the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=947.84s)]
*  right way, again, you should be pissed about this, cuz it's taking that popular policy [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=953.2s)]
*  and now making it unpopular. Cuz people are like, why are we sending innocent people to [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=957.52s)]
*  El Salvador? Why are we sending innocent people to dungeons? And by the way, more important than [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=962.08s)]
*  any of that is, why are you ignoring court orders? The court said, do not deport this guy. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=968.08s)]
*  Now the courts have ruled. Earlier courts said, don't deport him, so bring him back. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=975.2s)]
*  Supreme Court says, nine to nothing. Clarence Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, all those guys [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=980.32s)]
*  said the administration must facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. They were unanimous, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=987.6s)]
*  cuz it was super clear that the president must listen to the courts. And here the Trump [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=996.16s)]
*  administration comes out and goes, we don't care about the US courts. We don't care about [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1002.08s)]
*  the Constitution. We don't care what's true and not true. All we wanna do is lie and demagogue and [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1005.84s)]
*  get not only everybody to hate undocumented folks, whether they're criminals or not criminals, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1012.0s)]
*  whether they're in a gang or not in a gang or perfectly innocent. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1016.64s)]
*  And whether they've integrated into society, married an American citizen, have American kids, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1019.5200000000001s)]
*  and so we don't care about anything. All we wanna do is get you to hate, hate, hate, hate. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1023.6s)]
*  Hate the immigrants, hate the undocumented immigrants, smear them all. And if we gotta lie [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1028.96s)]
*  every single day to make that happen, they have no problems with it. And I find that disgusting, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1035.52s)]
*  absolutely disgusting. And I hate it when our side does things that are demonstrably not true. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1041.28s)]
*  Joe Biden is young and dynamic, and we call that out. And by the way, so look, a lot of right-wing [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1046.96s)]
*  voters who think whatever they think, they might or might not get this information. But if you're [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1052.4s)]
*  in right-wing media and you're still lying about how courts ordered him deported when they ordered [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1056.8s)]
*  the exact opposite, all right, brothers and sisters, you gotta live with yourself. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1063.12s)]
*  But now you know at least for sure that you're a giant liar for Donald Trump, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1069.28s)]
*  and you're doing it to demagogue and spread hatred. So have I been clear enough in getting [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1074.96s)]
*  the message out? And to the last point, yeah, is about Hakeem Jeffries and their response. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1079.84s)]
*  I like Chris Van Hollen's response, that's strong, right? Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1085.04s)]
*  we will get the word out. Well, will you? Because that sounded super strong. It sounded like you're [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1090.32s)]
*  really animated about it. The guy could barely has a pulse. Do something, for Christ's sake. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  You've got a tiny modicum of power, try to figure out, at least put some thought [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1103.84s)]
*  into how do I strategize to make a difference here. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1108.56s)]
*  So but with Democratic leadership strategizing, it's way too high a bar, apparently. Back to you, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1112.4s)]
*  yes. Hakeem Jeffries definitely leaves a lot to be desired to the point where it's like, how did you [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1119.76s)]
*  even elevate to the position that you're in right now? If that's the best he can give us, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1125.68s)]
*  we need somebody else. If he's the future of the Democratic party, it's looking a little bit dim [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1129.8400000000001s)]
*  and dull already, and that's not very encouraging. But to your point, Cenk, about not blaming the [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1135.3600000000001s)]
*  people who support these types of moves from the administration. I do get what you're saying. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1140.88s)]
*  And the only reason that I do have a small modicum of grace for them is exactly what you said. They're [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1145.5200000000002s)]
*  being lied to by people that they, for some reason, trust. And I say it's a small amount of grace [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1151.1200000000001s)]
*  because at some point, ignorance has to be a choice. And these people who are choosing [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1157.2s)]
*  ignorance are voting for policies and politicians based on these beliefs that they hold, which are [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1162.24s)]
*  based on things that they don't understand. And then other people are suffering for these votes [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1166.96s)]
*  that they're casting. But right wing media strategy is the same that it has been for so long. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1172.0s)]
*  They just scare the public with scary words like gangs and terrorists because fearful people don't [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1176.8s)]
*  care about things like due process. There's no time for any of that stuff when danger is lurking [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1182.8s)]
*  around every corner. When people's lives are being threatened, when gangs are running rampant, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1188.32s)]
*  when there's terrorism happening, which is what they're being told. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1192.8000000000002s)]
*  What's ironic about that is that the most recent incident of terrorism that I've heard of [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1196.4s)]
*  came from that MAGA guy who torched Governor Shapiro's house. I know that's another story, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1200.64s)]
*  but it is a little ironic. But then there is that other aspect to all of this that you mentioned at [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1204.72s)]
*  the end, Cenk. The Supreme Court unanimously, which never happens, ruled that we need to get [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1209.8400000000001s)]
*  this guy back. But now the Trump administration and right wing media are acting like it's all just [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1215.68s)]
*  diplomatically impossible for the United States to take on this president from El Salvador. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1220.96s)]
*  As if we haven't done that before. Let's be real, we know our nation's history. We have taken on [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1226.0s)]
*  entire governments before. If we wanted to negotiate a deal to get this guy back from [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1230.24s)]
*  El Salvador, we know we can do that, right? And no one is doubting that the United States [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1235.2s)]
*  can't get somebody back from El Salvador if it really wanted to. But they're acting like, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1239.44s)]
*  too bad, there's nothing we can do about it. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1244.48s)]
*  Yeah, so last two things here. First, crazy like a fox on tyt.com, one of our members on tyt.com. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1247.04s)]
*  It made a good point here and it goes along the lines of what I was gonna say, but he has a [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1257.44s)]
*  specific example. He said that mis-framing is exactly what the Democrats did with Gaza protesters. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1261.28s)]
*  And that's a great point. And I was gonna use a different example, which is [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1267.68s)]
*  yes, part of the reason why I give some in the right wing grace when they've heard the wrong [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1272.0800000000002s)]
*  information is because how many of our brothers and sisters on the left heard the wrong information [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1277.3600000000001s)]
*  from MSNBC and others in the media that Joe Biden was the best possible candidate for Donald Trump. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1283.68s)]
*  So we were a go against Donald Trump and that he had no mental decline issues at all. That it [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1289.52s)]
*  was a conspiracy theory, that it was perfectly young and dynamic behind the scenes when we [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1294.5600000000002s)]
*  couldn't see it. They got really good people to believe something that was so obviously not true. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1298.72s)]
*  I mean, Biden couldn't finish sentences, he's mumbling and wandering around shaking hands with [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1305.76s)]
*  invisible people talking about how his uncle was eaten by cannibals. And all of the media [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1310.8s)]
*  on the left were gaslighting people to no end. No, not only is he a good candidate to go against [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1315.76s)]
*  Trump, he was the very best candidate to go against Trump. And the reason I say that is because [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1321.84s)]
*  the reason I was against that is because not just because I have eyes and ears, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1328.16s)]
*  but he wasn't the best candidate to go against Trump. If he went against Trump, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1332.0800000000002s)]
*  we were guaranteed a loss. And those good people were being lied to and ironically, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1335.52s)]
*  it was helping Trump because they were gonna keep a senile man in the race, right? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1340.72s)]
*  So all those people who didn't believe that Biden was senile, who didn't believe that there was [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1345.6000000000001s)]
*  anything wrong with them, they thought he was a great dynamic candidate before the debate, right? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1350.4s)]
*  They're not bad people, they just got lied to, okay? So you could make a similar argument, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1355.6000000000001s)]
*  not an identical argument, but a similar one for people who are lied to in the right wing. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1362.32s)]
*  And to our members point here, on Gaza, did Biden and the Democrats do any better? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1366.96s)]
*  Bernie did and others did, but overall the Biden administration was like, those protesters, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1375.28s)]
*  how dare they, they're terrible. And now Trump has gone further and he's arresting and deporting [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1380.56s)]
*  them. But Biden helped their propaganda and totally lied about who those protesters were. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1386.8799999999999s)]
*  So I'm tired of both sides lying. You gotta ask better, not just of your politicians, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1392.56s)]
*  but also of your media. And that's what's gotten us into this division. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1398.08s)]
*  And now the last thing is the depressing part here. We got it in the live chat again, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1403.12s)]
*  I was curious about it. If you guys got more pessimistic about it overnight, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1406.24s)]
*  but we had asked this question yesterday in the live chat. Will Kilmar or [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1412.56s)]
*  Bray go Garcia be returned to the US? And only 28% said yes yesterday. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1416.32s)]
*  Let's see if we can see it in the live chat. Obviously shows live at six o'clock eastern. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1421.28s)]
*  Everybody check it out when you can and participate, be one of our members or not. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1424.64s)]
*  So right around the same numbers, 30 to 70. Man, if they never return that guy, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1428.0s)]
*  somebody else wrote in. Look, there's some chance that [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1431.84s)]
*  Captain Logos wrote in, Bray go Garcia is probably dead. And I don't know if he is or not. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1437.12s)]
*  That's why Senator Van Hollen from Maryland is going down to check on him. But remember, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1442.32s)]
*  he was worried that those gangs were gonna kill him. That prison is full of MS-13. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1446.56s)]
*  So we gotta get this guy back. And anyone who is in the Trump camp that already knows he's innocent [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1452.3999999999999s)]
*  and doesn't mind him dying there. Well, those are the people you should have enormous sustain for. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1460.8799999999999s)]
*  It's the height of immorality. It's beyond gross what they're doing to that guy, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1467.52s)]
*  just to protect Donald Trump's feelings. And because lying is literally part of their strategy. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1473.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I think whenever it comes down to it, this is just, it should not have happened in the [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1479.04s)]
*  first place, right? And this is what happens whenever you suspend processes like due process, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1486.8s)]
*  right? These things are in place for a reason. They are applicable to everybody who is here in [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1491.6s)]
*  this country. We don't know. The reason why we're having this debate as to whether or not he was [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1496.08s)]
*  actually a member of MS-13 is because there was no due process. There was nothing that determined [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1500.8s)]
*  whether or not he was. He was just sent back. And now we're in a situation where we can't really [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1505.68s)]
*  get ourselves out of the situation that we've got ourselves into in the first place. All of this was [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1510.72s)]
*  so completely unnecessary. And I do wanna say for El Salvador, they have had a long history of gang [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1515.28s)]
*  violence and crime. And then Bukele came in there and he's had a lot of human rights violations [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1523.2s)]
*  called out against him from the international watchdogs, right? For years this has been going [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1530.3999999999999s)]
*  on. So this is nothing new. And a lot of people down there, however, and I actually, I randomly [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1535.92s)]
*  know a lot of El Salvadorian people. There's a lot here in Houston. One of my best friends is [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1542.0s)]
*  El Salvador. So I get some insight there. But and also just from reading reports online, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1545.84s)]
*  a lot of people defend Bukele and all of this imprisonment of all these people who he says are [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1550.96s)]
*  gang members also without due process. Because they say, you know what? It's a little bit nicer [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1556.64s)]
*  here now in El Salvador. It's a little bit safer here in El Salvador. So that is also an argument [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1560.88s)]
*  that we're hearing now from anchors on places like Fox News that, you know what? It's better there [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1566.56s)]
*  now because all these people are in jail. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5D_KLanfxw&t=1571.44s)]
