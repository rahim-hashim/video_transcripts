# From Serial: ‘The Kids of Rutherford County’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvlPE0SUlgs)
*  Hey everyone, it's Sabrina.
*  I'm just jumping in here to tell you that today we're sharing the first episode of
*  a brand new series from our colleagues over at Serial Productions.
*  It's called The Kids of Rutherford County.
*  I don't want to give away too much, but I will tell you that the show does one of the
*  most powerful things journalism can do, which is to examine how we treat the most vulnerable
*  among us, in this case, young children.
*  The show tells the story of a juvenile detention center in Tennessee, and from the beginning,
*  the realities it lays out are pretty shocking.
*  But even more than that, I want to say they're illuminating.
*  They help you understand the world and what could, or maybe should, be different.
*  Okay, I hope you give it your time.
*  Here's Maribon Night and Serial Productions with the first episode of The Kids of Rutherford
*  County.
*  You can find the full four-part series wherever you get your podcasts, or if you're a subscriber
*  in the New York Times audio app.
*  It was a March afternoon in Rutherford County, Tennessee, a growing community about 30 miles
*  southeast of Nashville.
*  School was out for the day and a dozen or so little kids were playing a game of pickup
*  basketball in someone's backyard.
*  And then, as kids do, one said something about another kid's mom.
*  This insult led to some shoving.
*  And then as kids also do, one of them pulled out a cell phone and started filming.
*  There's some kind of heavy neon filter over the whole video, so it's hard to make out
*  any faces.
*  But here's what you can see.
*  An eight-year-old boy, hands shoved into the pockets of his oversized parka, is trying
*  to walk away from everyone when a smaller boy, about five or six, runs up behind him
*  and smacks him in the back a few times.
*  Then another little kid runs up and takes his turn, throws a couple feeble punches to
*  the back of the kid walking away.
*  Some of the older boys are egging them on.
*  Meantime, off camera, you can hear one girl try to break it up.
*  Other kids just stand around watching, and a few of them are also filming on their phones.
*  And then the video just ends.
*  It's the type of fight that barely seems worth posting online.
*  But that happened anyway, and soon the video started to make the rounds, spreading from
*  the kids to teachers and eventually to one police officer.
*  And it's what happened next, once this officer got involved, that the story really begins.
*  Because it's what caught everyone's attention to what's been happening to kids in Rutherford
*  County.
*  It's what caught mine.
*  From Serial Productions and The New York Times, I'm Mara Benight.
*  This is The Kids of Rutherford County, Episode 1, The Egregious Video.
*  A few weeks after the fight, Alexia Martin got a call from a police officer named Crystal
*  Templeton.
*  She said that my kids was on the video instigating the fight.
*  She was like, it was bullying, and she would like to talk to them, and that they wouldn't
*  be in no type of trouble.
*  So I made plans to meet Mrs. Templeton.
*  Later that day, Alexia and her 10-year-old daughter, Imariye, drove to meet Officer Templeton
*  on a side street.
*  So when I got there, Mrs. Templeton shows me the video, and I was like, well, that's
*  not my kids.
*  It's bullying.
*  She was like, well, I want to talk to the other kids and let them know what they're
*  doing is not right.
*  No one is in trouble.
*  I was like, well, okay.
*  She said, so can you identify your kids?
*  I said, yes, I can.
*  I said, that's my daughter.
*  It's the one who's saying stop to Taytay.
*  That's my son over there.
*  She said, so who are the rest of the other kids?
*  So my daughter, she wrote down all the kids' names, and we gave them to her.
*  The whole thing seemed very casual.
*  Alexia doesn't remember Officer Templeton even telling her that she was conducting an
*  investigation.
*  So when Imariye, Alexia's daughter, leaned over the hood of the police car and wrote
*  down the names of the kids in the video, she had no idea that what she was doing would
*  lead to 11 kids, including herself, getting arrested.
*  The reason why Officer Templeton was trying to ID all the kids in the video is because
*  she believed all of them bore some responsibility for the fight, or at least for not stopping
*  it.
*  With the two kids doing the actual hitting, she thought they were probably too young to
*  bring charges against.
*  They looked like they were about five or six years old, and in Rutherford County, they
*  generally didn't charge kids under seven.
*  But what about the other kids?
*  The kids standing around, the kids egging it on?
*  Officer Templeton wondered if there was a charge that would apply to all of them.
*  So relying on the memory of a 10-year-old, Officer Templeton took the list of names given
*  to her by Imariye and headed to the county's judicial commissioner's office for guidance
*  and what to charge them all with.
*  In Rutherford County, judicial commissioners are the people who approve charges.
*  At their office, the commissioner searched the state's database, and they found a statute
*  that seemed to fit the bill, criminal responsibility for conduct of another.
*  Officer Templeton would later say, quote, I looked at the charge to the best of my ability
*  from my experience was like, yeah, that's the charge.
*  The judicial commissioner signed off.
*  Petitions were secured.
*  Word went out.
*  Arrest these kids.
*  As would later be documented in over a dozen interviews with internal affairs investigators,
*  the arrests did not go smoothly.
*  Well, we'll go ahead and start with May 27th, 2016.
*  It is 11 a.m.
*  Sergeant Craig Snyder, officer of professional responsibility.
*  In an office at the local police department, Tammy Garrett, the principal at a school called
*  Hobgood Elementary, sat down with two of those investigators.
*  When did you become aware of the arrests that were going to take place at Hobgood, at your
*  school?
*  The investigation of the arrests?
*  Well, the investigation.
*  Principal Garrett told the investigators that Officer Templeton had shown her the video
*  of the fight on a Wednesday.
*  And by Friday morning, Templeton called to say the police were coming to Hobgood to arrest
*  some girls who were in the video.
*  But right away, Principal Garrett was concerned, partly because the kids Templeton named.
*  Well, Garrett hadn't seen all of them in the video.
*  There were kids that I knew that I didn't see in there that are good kids.
*  And at school, then I started thinking, you know, what's going on?
*  Yeah, what's going on?
*  I didn't see any of those kids.
*  Did she mention how she had identified those kids?
*  She had talked to some kids and the parents, is what she said.
*  And so I thought, well, she's an investigator, not me.
*  Maybe there's things I didn't know.
*  Still, Principal Garrett was worried.
*  It was her fourth year as principal at Hobgood Elementary, and she'd spent those years working
*  hard to build trust with parents and the kids at her school.
*  She thought it certainly wouldn't help that relationship if she was allowing police to
*  come to the school and arrest kids.
*  But she believed she didn't have a choice in the matter.
*  Principal Garrett said Officer Templeton assured her the arrests wouldn't be disruptive.
*  She said, I want to promise y'all that they weren't going to be handcuffed and that I'll
*  be there.
*  I'm going to take care of this.
*  It'll be discreet.
*  Garrett told Templeton her preference was that the girls be arrested before school let
*  out.
*  She didn't want a bunch of students in the hallways or the yard or in the bus lines seeing
*  their classmates get taken out by police officers.
*  But as the day wore on, getting closer to school dismissal at 2.30, Officer Templeton
*  still hadn't shown up at Hobgood.
*  Instead, three different police officers came.
*  And that's when things got confusing.
*  Crowded into the assistant principal's office discussing what to do next, Garrett said one
*  officer in a tactical vest was telling her, go get the kids.
*  But a second officer was telling her, don't go get the kids.
*  That officer seemed to be having second thoughts about the whole thing.
*  So he kept telling me, hey, this is not right.
*  I don't think this is right.
*  Was he specific with anything?
*  He said, this is going to blow up.
*  This is going to blow up.
*  You shouldn't do this.
*  This is not right.
*  Meaning the arrests.
*  Uh-huh.
*  And I don't know what to do.
*  The officer telling Principal Garrett not to go get the kids was Chris Williams.
*  In his internal affairs interview, Officer Williams said when he learned what these arrests
*  were about, he was shocked.
*  He was like, what in the world?
*  Because he'd seen the video of the fight the night before.
*  After Officer Templeton had asked him to check it out.
*  And he remembered when he watched it.
*  I was like, that's the egregious video that you were talking about?
*  And she was like, yeah.
*  And I'm like, well, if you follow any group of kids that get off the bus home, this is
*  what you're going to see.
*  This is normal behavior for most kids.
*  Then there was this.
*  All the kids in the video were black.
*  And most of the students at Hobgood were black or Latino.
*  Williams, who's also black, said he didn't think Templeton, who's white, was intentionally
*  going after these kids because of their race.
*  But he also said he couldn't help but wonder if something like this would happen at a school
*  that was mostly white.
*  Back in the assistant principal's office, Williams started calling up the chain of command,
*  moving not to stop the arrests, at least to slow things down while they got some clarity
*  on the situation.
*  And I'm trying to call someone to, I don't want to say, use common sense, but at least
*  think about what we're doing.
*  The first person Williams talked to was his sergeant, who told him to go forward with
*  the arrests.
*  He then called others to try to get a different answer.
*  He called a lieutenant, who didn't pick up.
*  Then he got through to a major, who essentially told him to just figure it out.
*  Meanwhile, the officer in the room telling Garrett to yes, go get the kids was Officer
*  Jeff Carroll, and he was making his own phone calls.
*  Carroll was a patrol officer and a SWAT team member.
*  He declined my interview requests, but in his internal affairs interview, he said, while
*  quote, nobody likes to arrest kids at school.
*  He had his orders.
*  I have one, our sergeant tells me to do something as long as I know it's not illegal, or in
*  my eyes, immoral.
*  I'm going to do it.
*  So who finally said go get the kids?
*  Carroll.
*  What made you listen to Carroll at that point?
*  You said they were saying don't, do, don't, do.
*  Because he was probably the more aggressive one.
*  So I went to get him.
*  Principal Garrett got three girls from their classrooms, an 11-year-old, a 10-year-old,
*  and an 8-year-old.
*  As I came up with the hall with the girls, I was kind of trying to prepare them.
*  I said, hey guys, the police are here.
*  We're going to the video.
*  You're going to have to come to the office with me.
*  Well, the oldest one was telling me, hey, these other two weren't even there.
*  You know, from me seeing the video, I didn't see them in the video, so I thought maybe
*  She had a pretty legitimate claim.
*  I don't know if that's right.
*  You said this was in the hallway?
*  Yeah, as we were walking down the hall.
*  She was like, Dr. G, they're not, they weren't even there.
*  They weren't even there.
*  One of the girls even had an alibi.
*  She'd been at a pizza party with her basketball team the day of the fight.
*  As Garrett walked the girls into the office, she turned to the cops and said, these two
*  weren't even there.
*  And then Officer Carroll got very aggressive with me.
*  He was like right here in my face and he pulled out the cuffs and he said, we're going now.
*  We're going now.
*  There's no more talking.
*  We're going now.
*  And I said, but, but, but, you know, they said they weren't even there.
*  And he said three times, really loud.
*  And he had the handcuffs right in my face and he was screaming at me.
*  I was scared and I didn't want to go to jail.
*  And so I backed off.
*  I was crying and the kids were crying and they were screaming and reaching for me.
*  And it was, it was, it was awful.
*  The other officers in the room don't recall screaming or yelling or Officer Carroll being
*  particularly aggressive, but they do confirm kids were crying and emotions were running
*  high.
*  Principal Garrett then told the police that one of the little girls had diabetes and got
*  treatment when she got home from school.
*  Carroll got on the phone with a sergeant who told him that the girl could sit tight in
*  the nurse's office for now, but the other two girls needed to be arrested.
*  Officer Carroll then turned to those two girls.
*  I told them, honey, something's come up.
*  We have to take y'all down to the juvenile detention center, but don't worry.
*  Your mom and dad's going to be able to pick you up as soon as we get down there.
*  Of course, they started crying.
*  The juvenile detention center, jail basically, one of the largest in the state, a two-tiered
*  jail with dozens of surveillance cameras, 48 cells and 64 beds.
*  And contrary to what Officer Carroll suggested to the girls, kids who get arrested don't
*  always get picked up by their mom and dad as soon as they get there.
*  Instead, according to the standard procedure, they can be booked, meaning jail staff record
*  their names and birth dates, do a 16-point search, and then place them in a holding area.
*  Inside the school office, Officer Carroll handcuffed the 11-year-old, and she dropped
*  to her knees.
*  A third officer handcuffed the 8-year-old, though once they got to the parking lot, he
*  took the handcuffs off because he later said, he, quote, didn't really think she was a
*  risk or anything.
*  Back in the office, Principal Garrett suddenly realized she forgot to get the last girl under
*  Templeton's list.
*  You know, because when I came in with those other three and it went crazy with the yelling
*  and stuff, I realized I never went and got the kid that was in the bus.
*  The kid on the bus was 10-year-old Imariye.
*  Not only was she the one who wrote down the names for Officer Templeton just the day before,
*  but she was also the one in the video saying, stop, stop, Tay-Tay.
*  And yet Garrett was still being told to get her.
*  So I said, she's on the bus by now.
*  They said, go get her.
*  So I had already that time, the man had already yelled at me.
*  I was already crying.
*  And they made me go out there crying in front of all my bus students and get her off the bus.
*  So I was on my way home.
*  You know, I had to get out of school on my way home.
*  This is Imariye.
*  But Miss Garrett, she came to get me and she had tears in her eyes.
*  And when she was whispering out, you're talking about the police.
*  That's when I broke down.
*  And that's when I shut everything out.
*  I was scared.
*  I didn't know what was going to happen.
*  I was going to go to jail.
*  It was just a lot.
*  And I was just trying to figure out what's going on, why is this happening, what am I
*  getting picked up for?
*  So my sister called me and told me I needed to get to the school because they was trying
*  to take my daughter to the detention.
*  And I said, okay, I'm on my way.
*  This again is Alexia, Imariye's mom.
*  When I got there, it was some police officers there.
*  They had my daughter.
*  She was crying, upset, throwing up everywhere.
*  And the police officers told me that they had to take them downtown.
*  They had to take her to the juvenile detention.
*  I was like, you got to take her to juvenile detention.
*  They haven't done nothing.
*  And they was like, well, this is out of our hands.
*  You got kids crying and don't want to go to the detention, don't know what they're going
*  to the detention.
*  And you got to hand your kids over to some strangers.
*  In total, 11 kids from across the county were brought to the juvenile detention center over
*  that video, one of them by mistake.
*  So she was released immediately.
*  The other 10 kids were processed.
*  When Imariye was taken to the detention center, jail staff recorded her name and birthdate,
*  searched her, confiscated her jewelry, all her small rings, and then placed her in a
*  holding area.
*  I just remember being in her cold and hearing the sound of the bugles go off and the doors
*  open and shutting.
*  And I was scared.
*  Imariye and five others got to go home the day they were arrested.
*  But four boys, two 10-year-olds, an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old, they were kept in jail
*  overnight.
*  Two of them were held all weekend.
*  One of the boys told me about how he was forced to shower in front of a guard and then given
*  a jumpsuit and put in a cell alone, which was all standard procedure for kids put in
*  detention in Rutherford County.
*  During waking hours, the kids aren't allowed to sleep.
*  I spoke to many people who told me that if they did fall asleep or if they were caught
*  lying down, the guard would bang on the cell door to wake them up or force them to stand
*  in the corner of their cell for long periods of time.
*  Ten, 11, 12-year-olds are kids who play freeze tag at recess.
*  They still snuggle on the couch with their parents and hold their hands when they get
*  scared.
*  In other words, these were kids.
*  More about what happened once the rest of the county and the world got wind of the arrests
*  after the break.
*  By the time the last kid was booked into the juvenile detention center, the news about
*  the arrests had gotten out.
*  A bunch of little kids arrested, some at school, with handcuffs.
*  People were pissed.
*  Outrageous spreading through one Tennessee community after five children were holed out
*  of their own interest.
*  More than 100 parents met at First Baptist Church in Murfreesboro over the weekend demanding
*  answers.
*  It was injustice to these kids, it was injustice to the family.
*  I just, I'm angry.
*  The shock spread beyond just Rutherford County.
*  Stories about the arrests appeared in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Daily
*  Mail.
*  Filling the outrage, it turned out that the charge brought against the kids criminal responsibility
*  for conduct of another.
*  It's not actually a charge.
*  It's a little technical, but criminal responsibility is a legal theory, one that was misunderstood
*  by both Officer Templeton, who launched the investigation, and the judicial commissioners
*  who approved the charges.
*  The cases against the kids were later all dismissed.
*  Soon after the arrests, the chief of police called for a thorough investigation to get
*  to the bottom of what happened.
*  Of the 20 people interviewed, investigators spent the most time with Officer Templeton.
*  So what we'll do is I'll first start with having you start at the beginning, wherever
*  you think the beginning's at.
*  Well, as my report says, on 413, at approximately 10 o'clock, a teacher showed me a video.
*  Officer Templeton declined to speak with me, but she spoke to internal affairs investigators
*  for almost seven hours.
*  And in those interviews, she talked about what she saw when she first watched the video
*  of the fight.
*  You know, the groups pushing these two little kids to assault this other child.
*  It was the whole group, and they're basically all doing the same thing.
*  At some point, someone could have went and got an adult.
*  I'm not saying jump in and physically stop the fight, but they could have went and got
*  an adult.
*  No one did anything.
*  So you felt obligated to try and arrest as many of those kids as possible?
*  I did not feel obligated at that point to arrest anyone.
*  I felt obligated to investigate it if the detective division wasn't going to.
*  Okay.
*  For much of this interview, the tone of Craig Snyder, the lead investigator, is what I describe
*  as perplexed over how arrests this unusual could happen in the first place.
*  But to Officer Templeton, she seems to think the arrests were all pretty straightforward.
*  In her view, she was just doing her job.
*  There's an assault here.
*  There's a victim here.
*  Juvenile court is about rehabilitation, and I felt like I needed to do something to help
*  these kids.
*  If I can get them in front of the judge, maybe she can put some services in the home, I don't
*  know, whatever.
*  It's about rehabilitation.
*  Did anybody at any point, did anybody at any point, any supervisor, did any of them at
*  any point tell you, no, you're not going to do this?
*  No.
*  No one ever said no.
*  No one ever said, you know, leave it alone.
*  No one ever said to me that.
*  They knew why I was doing what I was doing.
*  So if somebody told me no, stop, I would have stopped.
*  So you wouldn't change the way you did any of this?
*  Having the knowledge that I have today, knowing that all of this has turned into this, yes,
*  I would.
*  By this, I assume Officer Templeton is referring to many things.
*  The public relations disaster that had played out on the local news, the fact that it turns
*  out the kids were arrested on a charge that doesn't even exist, and that she's probably
*  definitely getting in trouble for this entire fiasco, which she later did.
*  A three day suspension.
*  But even still, Templeton tells the investigators,
*  If we were first taking away all of the knowledge that I've learned the last six weeks, no,
*  I would do it the same way I did it.
*  This is one of the most striking things I came across in my reporting.
*  The difference in perception between those on the outside of this juvenile system and
*  those on the inside.
*  To the general public, arresting a bunch of children and throwing them in jail for watching
*  a fight seemed, among other things, way out of line.
*  But to many insiders, like Officer Templeton or the sergeant who backed her up, the arrest
*  made sense.
*  Same for the judicial commissioners, even the juvenile judge.
*  Her response to the arrests was, quote, We are in a crisis with our children in Rutherford
*  County.
*  I've never seen it this bad.
*  It's hard to change a system when the insiders running that system don't see a problem with
*  it.
*  But there definitely was a problem.
*  In the years leading up to the arrests at Hopkins Elementary, Rutherford County's own
*  data showed that it was jailing a staggering number of kids.
*  The county had been warned about it, actually.
*  Years before, a consultant had told county officials that they were jailing kids at more
*  than three times the state average.
*  Still, nothing changed.
*  In fact, the numbers just kept going up.
*  Which meant for the kids of Rutherford County, getting sent to juvenile detention was almost
*  a rite of passage, a normal part of childhood.
*  In many cases, what it also was, was illegal.
*  This is a story of how that system came to be, how it came to be built, and how it came
*  to be accepted, lauded even.
*  It's also the story of the two insiders, former juvenile delinquents themselves, who actually
*  did see the problem in Rutherford County, what it was doing to kids.
*  They just needed other people to see it too.
*  It's next time on The Kids of Rutherford County.
