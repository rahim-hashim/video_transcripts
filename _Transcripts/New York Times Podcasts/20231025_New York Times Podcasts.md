*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverny-C, and this is the Daily.
*  Almost immediately after Israel was attacked on October 7, it began preparing for a ground
*  invasion of Gaza.
*  But more than two weeks later, that invasion hasn't happened.
*  Today, I talk to Jerusalem Bureau Chief Patrick Kingsley about why.
*  It's Wednesday, October 25.
*  So Patrick, it's 6.30 in the evening in New York, and it's 1.30 in the morning where
*  you are in Israel.
*  We know you've had a really long day.
*  Tell us where we're reaching you right now and what you've been doing.
*  You're reaching me on the road between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
*  I've spent the last nine hours watching security camera footage from a kid books in the
*  South called Kidbooks Battery, where more than 100 people were killed on October 7 during
*  the Hamas terrorist attacks.
*  And I've been trying to research exactly what happened that day to try and piece together
*  the events of a day.
*  And it's been a long few weeks as it has for everyone here, Israelis and Palestinians.
*  It has been a long and horrible few weeks.
*  And I wanted to call you Patrick because I wanted to hear what you had to say about the
*  next few weeks, the next phase.
*  And the thing that's really been a central focus, I think for everyone and certainly in
*  our coverage, has been a ground invasion.
*  You know, that was something that we were hearing about really from the very first days
*  after this horrific attack on Israel.
*  And we keep hearing that it is about to happen and it is imminent.
*  There are currently tens of thousands of troops amassed at the southern border with Gaza.
*  You know, we've had colleagues there, photographers taking photographs of tanks arrayed in fields,
*  really kind of contributing to this feeling that this thing is about to happen, right?
*  But it hasn't.
*  So let's start to unpack the reasons why.
*  Well, one reason why they might be delaying is the fact that there are more than 200 mostly
*  Israeli hostages now in captivity in Gaza.
*  I just believe that most of them are being held underground in Hamas's network of subterranean fortifications.
*  And there are intense negotiations going on, not directly between Hamas and Israel,
*  because they don't have formal relations.
*  But mediated by Qatar and some extent, Egypt, there are talks to try and get some of them out.
*  And we've already seen four released.
*  There were two, another one daughter released a few days ago and then yesterday to elderly women
*  who were released to the Egyptians over the border between Egypt and Gaza.
*  And there have been reports that maybe there could be 50 more on the way in the coming days,
*  reports of maybe women and children could be released.
*  None of these have been confirmed.
*  But while those negotiations still have a chance of liberating some of the people who have been captured,
*  it is thought that Israel is holding back from the ground invasion,
*  lest it harm the chances of winning those people's freedom.
*  And as we know, getting hostages out is pretty complicated.
*  It takes time.
*  So hostages is one of the reasons for the wait.
*  It's one of the factors, but there are others.
*  One is that if Israel invades Gaza, it is feared that that will then open up a second front
*  with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that dominates southern Lebanon,
*  which is allied to Hamas and like Hamas is backed by Iran.
*  So there's a fear that they might get involved, even more than they already have done.
*  Then there's the fact that Hamas is very well dug in underneath its stronghold of Gaza City.
*  It has hundreds of miles of tunnels that it's borrowed away over the last decade and a half.
*  And it's very hard to get to them there.
*  And it's very easy for their fighters to pop up through openings in the ground
*  and ambush the incoming Israeli army.
*  And there's a sense that this could become a kind of urban quagmire
*  for huge loss of life to Gaza civilians
*  and to the Israeli ground forces going in and trying to edge their way towards Hamas's stronghold in Gaza City.
*  Right. I mean, cities are notoriously impossible to conquer.
*  Right. And Gaza is this extremely densely populated place like armies go in.
*  They get stuck. I mean, this is something that the Americans experienced in Iraq in Fulujah in 2004
*  and in the northern city of Mosul in 2016.
*  I know that our colleagues in Washington have been talking to American officials
*  and Tuesday morning in the paper had a big story about how American officials were actually quite worried
*  that the Israeli military wasn't prepared for this hadn't quite taken on board
*  just how difficult this fight would be and might not be ready for it.
*  How does that factor in?
*  Well, I think that's not only an American consent.
*  There's talk in Israel that the Israeli army needs to gather more intelligence
*  about exactly where different Hamas fighters and different Hamas fortifications are situated.
*  And there's a sense that also Israel isn't in a rush.
*  It doesn't need to charge in immediately.
*  And the extra time though nerve-racking for its forces also gives them more time to train.
*  Remember that a lot of the people that are mass on the guards in border are reservists
*  who've been cooled up several hundred thousand of them.
*  And I think crucially it gives the air force more time to try and take out Hamas fighters
*  and tunnels from the air.
*  There are some who think maybe they're trying to clear certain roots
*  creating a kind of corridor or corridors that would allow their troops to enter
*  guards and reach the central guards because they see a slightly less obstructed route.
*  And of course there's another layer to the planning here and we also know this from Iraq
*  and that's of course the question of, you know, if you do go in, what do you do after that?
*  Like do you actually try to run it?
*  That's the million dollar question because even when Israel does retake the guards' strip
*  it could have to decide whether it wants to govern the enclave as it did between 1967 and 2005
*  or whether it wants to relinquish control of it at least nominally to some other party.
*  It can't do that to Hamas, the whole point of going in is to destroy Hamas.
*  And then that probably leaves the Palestinian Authority which is the Palestinian body that
*  a minister's parts of the occupied by spank.
*  But if it did that the Palestinian Authority would face a real crisis of legitimacy
*  because it would be perceived by many guards as having road back to power on the back of an Israeli tank.
*  And it may find it would lose control of the enclave as quickly as it did in the 2000s
*  when it was given control of Gaza for two years between 2005 and 2007 before being forced out by Hamas.
*  So yes there are the hostages, yes there are fears of a second front opening up with Lebanon.
*  But also there's the big question of what will Israel do with Gaza after it captures the
*  territory and it's a difficult choice and that is what we presume is partly why Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  Israeli leader is taking his time to issue an invasion order.
*  Yes as you say ultimately that decision, the decision of whether to invade in all of the consequences
*  it brings rests with one man.
*  Yes Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick bring me inside the calculations of Benjamin Netanyahu at this moment.
*  I mean initially of course he declared there would be an end to Hamas with this great urgency.
*  And now there's what appears to be a delay in the ground invasion one of the principle
*  ways that he would reach that objective. How does he see all of this?
*  I think the first thing to remember is that historically he's always been quite about it making big
*  decisions. He tends to devouricate and delay and try and push things off until the next day.
*  We've seen that all this year with his domestic policies, very controversial plan to
*  overhaul the judiciary. No one's ever really been sure what exactly his plan has been.
*  Managed plan has seemed to sort of change on a kind of day by day basis and that also seems to be
*  the case with this planned invasion of Gaza. But in a sense that's sort of Netanyahu's trademark.
*  He pushes off big decisions until the very last moment. And partly that's because it is a big
*  decision. If he goes in there could be a big loss of life for Israeli soldiers just as there will be
*  even bigger loss of life for ordinary Palestinians in Gaza. And he knows that that will bring pain to
*  a lot of Israelis, a lot of voters. And it's not a decision that he or any Israeli leader is going
*  to take lightly. There's another factor that some political analysts have been talking about,
*  which is that the failure of October 7th, the collapse of the Israeli military defense
*  in the South, ultimately in many people's eyes, is on him. The buck stops with the prime minister
*  of a day. And he is the Israeli leader who presided over that failure. And so while Israelis are
*  relatively united at the moment, because it's a war because they've just experienced this huge
*  trauma of October 7th, after the war it will be a completely different case. There's bound to be
*  a national inquiry. And that probably isn't going to look good for the people who are in charge.
*  And that includes Netanyahu. It could collapse his government that would then lead to a new election.
*  And if the current situation remains the same, then he would struggle to win that election.
*  And he'd be out of power. So there are some people who think that he's in no rush to start a
*  ground invasion because the sooner the invasion begins, the sooner the war ends. And the sooner the
*  war ends, the likely it is that there will be a threat to his political power.
*  So in other words, the decision is also a political one for Netanyahu. I mean, potentially a
*  matter of his political survival. Yes. And that's partly why he was keen to bring in
*  members of the opposition into his government. A couple of weeks ago he formed a unity government
*  bringing in some members of the central opposition, including two former senior generals that gave
*  his cabinet more experience, more military heft. But it also meant that he can spread responsibility.
*  Whatever happens now is not just going to be on him. It'll also be on those two generals
*  who he brought into his war cabinet. And that's both a security,
*  mind the decision. But it's also being construed by some analysts as a very political decision
*  because after the war and when assessments are made of how the war went, he won't be alone on the
*  stage in front of critics who will be analyzing his performance.
*  And Patrick, what is the public sentiment here? I mean, is there a chomping at the bit to invade?
*  How does the Israeli public see this? I think the bottom line is this,
*  polling shows that a majority of Israelis do support a ground invasion and there's a sense that
*  after what Hamas did on October 7th, there's no way that Israel could really countenance
*  keeping a Senate's leadership on their doorstep. But underneath that headline, there's a lot of
*  nuance. For a start, there's a small and not particularly vocal minority that doesn't want to
*  invade a tool. And even among the people that do want an invasion, there are a mixture of positions.
*  There are certainly those that sound very vengeful. There are people on the far right who are
*  calling for the expulsion of all Palestinians from Gaza. But then there's also probably a much
*  bigger group that just wants to get rid of Hamas and is wary of the pain and loss that a ground
*  invasion will bring. It will be bloody. It will likely involve great loss of life, mostly on the
*  Palestinian side, but also for the Israeli soldiers. And all across Israel, there are families,
*  probably the majority of families that have someone who is at the front or preparing to go to the
*  front. And those families know that they're like one might not make it back. And so the whole
*  conversation about an invasion is tinged with a sense of necessity, but also a sense of
*  anxiety and danger. And in the meantime, these realies have launched this relentless series of
*  air strikes over Gaza. You've been reporting on that. Tell us what you're learning, Patrick.
*  What are you hearing in your reporting? I think the bottom line is it's the most intense Israeli
*  bombing campaign on Gaza ever. The ministry said today that they had hit 7,000 targets in Gaza
*  in just over two and a half weeks. Wow, 7,000 targets. Exactly. And the Hamas run
*  health ministry in Gaza said yesterday that nearly 6,000 people had died doing that bombing
*  campaign. That isn't the figure that we've been able to verify, but if it's anything close to it,
*  then it's quite a staggering number. Whole neighborhoods have been leveled, including in
*  the wealthier parts of Gaza City areas that typically have not been damaged or only lightly
*  damaged in previous rounds of conflict between Hamas and Israel. Israel says that it only targets
*  militants and military infrastructure and that any civilian loss of life is because the militants
*  Hamas are of themselves into civilian areas in order to give themselves human shields. But to
*  Palestinians, the bombing campaign, Israel's bombing campaign feels like it's targeting civilians
*  themselves because there has been such a high death toll across civil society,
*  medical workers killed, journalists killed, bombs on marketplaces, mosques, and so on.
*  And coupled with that is a rising humanitarian crisis that has been set off by Israel's siege
*  of Gaza. It's cut off water, it's cut off electricity, it's cut off almost all food supplies,
*  and it's encouraged hundreds of thousands of guys and to move from the north of the strip to
*  the south, which means that southern Gaza is very, very overcrowded. People are scavenging
*  essentially every day to find food and water and life has become extremely difficult for
*  Palestinian- anything Gaza. Not that it's always easy before the war, but it's been taken to another level now.
*  So Patrick, is there a risk here with the civilian casualties mounting and this deepening humanitarian
*  crisis in Gaza that the longer the airstrikes continue, the more Israel risks losing support for
*  its ground offensive? I think that's about right. In the opening days of this particular
*  complex, Israel had just experienced what its president has called the bloodiest day for Jews
*  since the Holocaust, and it felt like there was broad global support, particularly from leaders,
*  if not citizens for Israel taking essentially defensive action against the group that had enacted
*  all these massacres in southern Israel, Hamas. But as time's gone on, and the air raids have increased,
*  and the loss of life in Gaza has grown and grown, and the narrative has shifted away from the
*  villages that were raided in southern Israel early this month to the crowded urban areas of Gaza,
*  where thousands of Palestinians have been killed in bomb strikes. As a result, you're starting to see
*  different measures come out from global leaders, one in which they talk about Israel needing to
*  respect international law, avoiding loss of civilian life. You're not quite seeing
*  Western leaders coming out strongly against an invasion and in and of itself, but there's
*  seen to be more quantifies and qualifications attached to the West's expression of support for its
*  and that rhetorical shift may accelerate and morph into something stronger, for example,
*  an outright rejection of an Israeli invasion of Gaza. So Patrick, there've been a lot of comparisons
*  in recent days to the US after 9-11, and this idea that the US was in this fog of anger and
*  emotion after the attack and made some real strategic errors in the wake of it, namely invading Iraq.
*  Has this come up at all in your reporting as you're talking to Israelis, people in the government,
*  Israeli citizens? Is anybody talking about Israel and how it might be about to make a strategic
*  mistake if it does this ground invasion? I think that the 9-11 comparison has been made
*  frequently both in Israel and outside and to begin with, I think, Israelis thought it was a
*  useful comparison to make because by comparing it to 9-11, they could convey to the world
*  just what a big deal it was for terrorists to come and slaughter around 1400 Israelis, many of them
*  in their homes. But as time's gone on, it's taken on a double meaning because, as you say,
*  and as Joe Biden has said, what America did in the aftermath of 9-11 in the heat of its emotion
*  was not necessarily the wisest, including the invasion of Iraq and the quagmire that became.
*  And certainly there are plenty of people in Israel and outside who acknowledge that making decisions
*  in the heat of the moment is not the best plan. But at the same time, other people say,
*  well, hang on, Iraq was thousands of miles away from America, but Gaza is right on Israel's doorstep
*  and it doesn't have the luxury of not taking the threat of Hamas seriously. It has to do something
*  and far from being irrational and emotional to respond to what Hamas has done. It's actually the most
*  logical thing to try to remove this organization that's just led these dodgy messicas in southern
*  Israel. And then there's another group of people that's zoom out even further and they're looking
*  beyond what happens if you root out Hamas and they're saying it's all very well to get rid of
*  Hamas. But if you don't have a wider plan, not just for who runs Gaza, but what to do about the
*  Israeli Palestinian conflict, how to address the long-running challenges and imbalances,
*  have created this conflict, then a certain point down the line, there's going to be just another
*  explosion and a repeat and the cycle will go on and on. So Patrick, from everything you've said,
*  there are of course enormous risks if Israel goes ahead with a ground invasion. But there's also
*  an enormous human toll if Israel continues with these air strikes while they delay. But is there
*  also a third way that we're not talking about here, which is just calling it off? Is there any
*  chance that that's where we're headed that a ground invasion may not happen at all?
*  It's always possible and people are voicing that suggestion a little bit more vocally than they
*  were a few days ago. But I think if Israel didn't launch a ground invasion, many Israelis would see
*  that as a capitulation to a group that's just killed 1,400 Israelis in a single day.
*  That sets about a precedent that makes Israel seem weak and would cause them a massive loss of
*  face. So the idea that Israel would not respond to something of that magnitude and would just call
*  off a ground invasion and let the group perpetrate that massacre, remain on its doorstep, feels a little
*  bit hard to believe. So does this mean we're going to be in this place for a while?
*  You know, anticipating a ground invasion with really no end in sight of these air strikes?
*  Well, anything's possible, but us reported on the ground certainly aren't standing down anytime soon.
*  And ourselves.
*  Patrick, I don't hear this out of the car behind you. You're home.
*  Yes, that's right. I'm home and I'm looking forward to going to bed.
*  I'm going to let you go to do that. Thank you so much, Patrick, for talking to me.
*  Thank you, Sabrina, it speaks in.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. A third lawyer who tried to help Donald Trump overturn
*  the results of the 2020 election has pleaded guilty in a Georgia racketeering case and agreed to
*  cooperate with prosecutors building a case against Trump. The lawyer, Jenna Ellis, now joins Sydney
*  Powell and Kenneth Chesbro in flipping on Trump. In a tearful statement to the court, Ellis said
*  she regretted her involvement in Trump's campaign to steal the election.
*  If I knew then what I know now, I would have declined to represent Donald Trump in these
*  post-election challenges. I look back on this full experience with Deep Remorse.
*  And in a dramatic day on Capitol Hill, divided House Republicans, nominated another candidate
*  for House Speaker, watched him drop out hours later, and then nominated yet another candidate for
*  the job. The first nominee of the day, representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota, with Drew after
*  facing a backlash from right-wing House members who feared he was insufficiently conservative.
*  After that, Republicans nominated Mike Johnson of Louisiana, a more conservative figure than Emmer.
*  But it's unclear whether Johnson has brought enough support to actually win the
*  speakership during the vote on the House floor.
