# The Sunday Read: ‘The High-Risk Feat of Bringing ‘American Born Chinese’ to TV’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjJskBZFWu4)
*  Hi, my name is Jamie Fisher and I work for and sometimes write for the New York Times
*  Magazine.
*  This week's Sunday Read is a recent magazine story of mine about Gene Luen Yang, who wrote
*  the beloved coming of age graphic novel American Born Chinese.
*  I got a chance to chat with Gene about the arc of his career and the moment he finds
*  himself in now with this big star studded screen adaptation of American Born Chinese
*  that's out now on Disney+.
*  We also talked a lot about the kind of faith he puts in readers and whether he's able
*  to do the same with the TV audience.
*  So the groundbreaking thing about American Born Chinese is that it was the first graphic
*  novel ever nominated for a National Book Award in any category.
*  It took a book like Gene's 17 years ago to make the awards organization understand that
*  graphic novels could rise to the level of literature.
*  At its heart, American Born Chinese is about identity and the plot is just kind of wild.
*  There are three strands to it.
*  One is about the Monkey King, which is a retelling of the 16th century Chinese novel Journey
*  to the West.
*  Another strand is about a young boy named Jin Wang, who struggles as he grows up in
*  a largely white community.
*  As you're reading, the strands seem totally unrelated until the moment when it all comes
*  together.
*  But the trickiest part of American Born Chinese to adapt to the screen was the third strand
*  in the book, the one that includes a character named Jin Qi.
*  That's C-H-I-N hyphen K-E-E.
*  So Jin Qi is kind of a Steve Urkel character in the book.
*  He's this offensive Chinese stereotype.
*  He brings a cat for lunch, for example.
*  He speaks broken English.
*  He makes ugly jokes and he has this very caricatured appearance, similar to old Yellow Peril comics.
*  When you see Jin Qi in the novel, you also see a laugh track that's been drawn under
*  every scene he's in.
*  And if you've read American Born Chinese, you probably understand something Jin told
*  me, which is that he has a lot of faith in his readers.
*  He trusts them to stop and think, and he trusts them to be intelligent consumers.
*  But that changes when readers become viewers, when characters can wind up in places totally
*  without context, where it could wound.
*  So that might be in a short YouTube clip that goes viral, or a screenshot that could spread
*  for the wrong reasons on social media.
*  And Jin told me that prospect kept him up at night.
*  He also said that he'd written Jin Qi's character as a kind of exorcism of the stereotypes
*  he grew up against as an Asian American.
*  In adapting American Born Chinese to the screen, the biggest challenge the show's creators
*  faced was figuring out how not to defang those aspects of the novel without making
*  it sharper in the wrong ways.
*  So here's my story, The High Risk Feat of Bringing American Born Chinese to TV, read
*  by Emily Wu Zeller.
*  Almost everyone who reads American Born Chinese, Jin Lun Yang's groundbreaking graphic novel,
*  is a little afraid of Jin Qi.
*  The book is a classic of young adult literature, threading together stories of Asian American
*  boyhood with a revered Ming dynasty novel.
*  Jin Qi's role in it is a small one, but he is the bomb at the book's heart.
*  He's a kind of Urkel character, embarrassing comic relief that isn't so funny for the
*  people who have to live with him.
*  A cruel marionette pieced together from ugly stereotypes.
*  He makes the old schoolyard, me Chinese rhymes, begins sentences with confucius say.
*  He sings she bangs in a library, in the style of the American Idol contestant William Hung.
*  At one point he eats a packed lunch with a cat peeking out of the container.
*  A laugh track runs in a ribbon under each scene.
*  A brutal little receipt.
*  Ha ha ha ha ha.
*  So when news arrived in 2021 that American Born Chinese would be adapted as a live action
*  Disney Plus streaming series, the first reaction from some readers was more or less, oh no.
*  Yang gets it.
*  For a long time he too was afraid of Jin Qi.
*  The character is a presence he grew up with.
*  He refers to it as a haunting, a symbol of things he wanted to escape.
*  Back when he was a superhero besotted child, drawing panels about Transformers who turned
*  into fruit, Yang always avoided buying comics starring Shang-Chi, Marvel's cliched Kung
*  Fu character.
*  He worried about the way people might see him if he brought them to the register.
*  Making some of his fears legible in Jin Qi almost felt like an exorcism, Yang told me.
*  Just putting it down on paper made it feel smaller and more manageable.
*  When American Born Chinese was published in 2006, it won Prince and Eisner awards and
*  was the first graphic novel ever to be a finalist for a National Book Award.
*  That's where Yang came into his own as an artist.
*  A teller of large-scale, gloriously cinematic tales that also feel touchingly person-size,
*  neatly interweaving storylines at the intersections of cultures and faiths, East and West, Present
*  and Past.
*  In some ways American Born Chinese has always seemed perfect for the screen.
*  It's full of visual sequences as grand and colorful as they are intimate.
*  With narrative stakes sometimes as big as salvation, and sometimes as small as science
*  class.
*  And so the story's arrival on Disney+, this month, can seem like a predestined coronation.
*  Its celebrated cast includes Ki Hui Kuan and Michelle Yeoh, fresh from the success of Everything
*  Everywhere All at Once, now in a series with similar imaginative exuberance and a major
*  studio budget.
*  But that skips past the many years when none of this was a given.
*  Part of the difficulty was Hollywood itself, which wasn't yet ready to center Asian American
*  stories.
*  The other obstacle, though, was Chin Ki.
*  Yang was terrified about what might happen if this character he made, this caricature,
*  wound up on screen.
*  I was always freaked out that if it was ever adapted, clips of that character would show
*  up on YouTube, you know, he says, completely decontextualized.
*  It wasn't until he talked with the producers Kelvin Yu and Melvin Marr that Yang felt someone
*  might safely introduce Chin Ki to the wider world.
*  Part of the reason the book has teeth is because he wasn't playing it safe, you told me in
*  April.
*  At one point, before the pandemic, there was progress on a significantly edgier Atlanta-like
*  version of the show for FX.
*  You described some details to me on a video call, to a Disney publicist's alarm.
*  The trick, of course, was what it had always been.
*  Translating the story to the screen without defanging it.
*  And without offering the wrong kind of pleasure in its sharpness.
*  Yang grew up in a family of storytellers, and the way he tells his own stories brings
*  together two very different traditions.
*  The way his mother told them, and the way his father did.
*  It was Yang's mother who told her sons about the Monkey King, the hero of the 16th century
*  Chinese novel Journey to the West.
*  In some ways, that book is an unlikely candidate for a story beloved by generations of children.
*  It's a bureaucratic satire, bristling with surreal plot lines and more than a hundred
*  Buddhist and Taoist gods.
*  But the story at its heart is one Yang has returned to all his life.
*  The journey the Monkey King takes, he told me by phone in April, is from arrogance to
*  humility, or self-centeredness to enlightenment.
*  And then my dad mostly just made stories up off the top of his head, Yang said.
*  He invented a character called a Tong, a little boy in a Taiwanese village whose father makes
*  him do all these really gross chores, like picking up cow dung with chopsticks.
*  The loving strand of gross-out humor running through Yang's work, one of his first graphic
*  novels involves a spaceship flying up a kid's nose.
*  Oh something to a Tong.
*  That Yang is now a 49-year-old father of four, and a respected voice of indie comics amuses
*  his longtime friend, the writer and artist Derek Kirk Kim.
*  Gene's really into body humor, he says eagerly, then pauses.
*  I have a story, but I don't think it's publishable.
*  Yang's maternal grandfather worked for the nationalist government in China.
*  The family fled to Hong Kong and then Taiwan when the communists came to power.
*  Yang's father is from Taiwan, but the couple didn't meet until they came to San Jose for
*  graduate school in the late 1960s.
*  Yang was raised in a Chinese Catholic community in the Bay Area, where the revolution felt
*  both very distant and absurdly fresh.
*  Some of the priests in his community had spent decades in re-education camps, he recalls.
*  They all had these very intense stories.
*  The holidays they celebrated were a cultural mishmash.
*  For Christmas, there'd be a Chinese guy dressed as Santa, he says.
*  They celebrated All Souls Day as if it were Qingming Festival, with incense and bowing,
*  he says, the way we Chinese have been honoring ancestors for centuries.
*  There are many threads of Chinese-American experience.
*  This was a highly specific and sometimes vexed one.
*  Years later, when Yang read about the Boxer Rebellion, a folk uprising that tried to wipe
*  out foreign influence in China at the turn of the 20th century, killing many Chinese
*  Christians in the bargain, that tension between Western faith and Eastern culture just felt
*  very resonant to me, he says.
*  It felt like something I had lived before.
*  Like the family in American-born Chinese, the Yangs made regular trips to a traditional
*  Chinese medicine practice, driving an hour to San Francisco to seek treatment for his
*  asthma.
*  The practitioners were not polite, but they were kind, the way old Chinese people are,
*  he says.
*  She would examine my tongue, and then she would write all these Chinese characters on
*  a piece of paper, like a prescription.
*  An herbalist would wrap up the ingredients, which Yang's mother would boil down into
*  a dark soup full of intriguing lumps.
*  These trips stopped when Yang was in junior high, after a visit from a Taiwanese priest.
*  He prayed over me, Yang remembers, and I had a vision in my head.
*  It was Jesus, maybe.
*  It wasn't a clear vision, he says.
*  It was sort of like how you see through tears.
*  For years after that, his asthma didn't bother him anymore when running cross country.
*  Yang's life has been punctuated by moments of spiritual recognition.
*  The most important may have been the five-day silent retreat he attended, after college,
*  with other young Chinese Catholics.
*  At that point, Yang had a degree in computer science from Berkeley, but no clear sense
*  of purpose.
*  It was during the retreat that he decided both to become a high school teacher and to
*  pursue comics.
*  For 17 years, he taught computer science at Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland.
*  All through his 20s and 30s, he also met weekly with a group of Bay Area cartoonists.
*  They called themselves the Art Night Crew.
*  They gather at someone's home to eat and draw, looking over one another's work.
*  I never went to art school, Yang says.
*  I felt like that was my art school.
*  Derek Kirk Kim was part of that crew, along with the artists Jason Shiga, Lark Pien, Tin
*  Pham, and Jesse Hamm.
*  Even now, I think those are some of the best times that I remember, Kim says.
*  We were all beginning.
*  We all had the fire in our stomach to change the medium.
*  They dreamed of staking out the territory between bright, sanitized commercial comics
*  and dark underground work.
*  But Kim also points out that before Yang and Shiga, he'd never even met another Asian
*  American cartoonist.
*  One of the reasons we purposely made all our characters Asian American is we never saw
*  that growing up, he says.
*  It seemed impossible to do that in films, but we thought at least we could do it in
*  comics.
*  In comics, nobody would stop you.
*  Yang was working on American Born Chinese and would share pages for feedback.
*  Kim pushed the work on his publisher, First Second Books, calling it the book I've been
*  waiting for all my life.
*  He pretty much threatened me, First Second's founder, Mark Siegel, told me.
*  He read the draft on a plane, in a trance.
*  American Born Chinese tells three stories at once, with such unshowy confidence that
*  they seem to have always belonged together.
*  The hero of its coming-of-age story is Jin Wang, a quiet, isolated boy in a mostly white
*  community.
*  The second storyline is a significantly simplified and somewhat Catholicized retelling of Journey
*  to the West, in which the Monkey King grapples with his pride and his resentment over being,
*  in the end, a monkey.
*  And the third is essentially a sitcom, featuring the grotesque Chin-Ki.
*  None of these elements are contradictory, though to say more would be to ruin the satisfaction
*  of the moment when the storylines resolve.
*  From there, things happened quickly.
*  One moment, Yang and his friends were cramming into a hotel room at San Diego Comic-Con to
*  sell stapled-together zines.
*  Then flash forward eighteen months, Siegel says, and we're in our tuxes in Times Square
*  with David Remnick introducing the National Book Award nominees.
*  Yang would follow with works like the two-volume Boxers and Saints from 2013, which vividly
*  inhabits the entangled lives of two Chinese children, one destined to lead boxer insurgents
*  and the other to unglamorous Christian martyrdom.
*  A few years later, Yang would become one of the few graphic novelists to win a MacArthur fellowship.
*  In a supplement to a new edition of American-Born Chinese, Yang observes that Asian-Americans
*  sometimes feel like we are guests in America, treated as foreign no matter how long they've
*  lived in this country.
*  We try to be good guests and not make a fuss, he says, because America feels like somebody
*  else's home.
*  When I asked Yang when he first had that sense of being a guest in his own country, he answered
*  quietly, I don't ever remember not feeling like that.
*  It wasn't until attending Berkeley, surrounded by students who looked like him, that Yang
*  began to feel he had always belonged.
*  The young people who tell him how much they related to American-Born Chinese, he said,
*  are almost always immigrants' kids.
*  They're often not Asian-American, but their parents came from somewhere else, and they
*  grew up here.
*  He's informed a generation with that book, Kim told me.
*  Out of all of us, I think Gene had the most impact on the world.
*  He's like our Beyoncé.
*  In Dragon Hoops from 2020, in part a memoir about his last year as a teacher, Yang writes
*  that the characters in a comic should function like the characters of an alphabet.
*  Each must be visually distinct, with easily identifiable markers.
*  You see this most clearly in Yang's noses.
*  He makes curly cues, dashes, wedges, round, pokeable blobs.
*  He claims glumly that this is just me making up for my own inadequacies as a cartoonist.
*  He used to start his books on napkins, which made his first doodles feel low stakes, and
*  his style, clean, clear, and inviting, retains that napkin-level approachability.
*  As I got older, he says, I realized that the intimacy of your illustrator voice is actually
*  more important than things like perspective, or even like anatomical proportions.
*  Part of that intimacy comes from the way Yang uses visual metaphors to show emotion.
*  Gene's cloud-like hair crackling with lightning, or a word from his crush blanketing him in
*  bed.
*  Television speaks a very different language, but the Disney Plus rendering of American-born
*  Chinese is a surprisingly effective translation.
*  It opens with a VFX-heavy chase scene between the Monkey King and his son, Wei Chen, whose
*  shaggy prosthetic hair gives him a striking resemblance to Teen Wolf.
*  But the show soon relaxes into something much closer to the book's deep, funny charisma,
*  honoring the surreality of Yang's world, with little touches like an old-Navy-esque store
*  that also sells, for some reason, milk.
*  In the book, the three storylines have equal weight.
*  But the show recalibrates.
*  Wei Chen, played by Jimmy Liu with endearing confidence, becomes the hero of the second
*  story, rather than his father.
*  And Gene's parents, barely present before, are brought to life in an arc about his tart,
*  practical mother and her sad, demure husband, who believes perhaps too much in the American
*  dream.
*  Don't you remember who you used to be?
*  She pleads with him.
*  We came here with nothing, no connections.
*  Where did that brave man go?
*  The showrunner Kelvin Yu, who has young children and recently lost his own mother, told me
*  that he sees this new story as a love letter to his parents.
*  It's a change Yang embraces.
*  Comics, he says, are such a personal medium.
*  It's a lot of work, but it's manageable for a single person to do it.
*  A television series, though, should show the thumbprints of everyone who works on it.
*  It's no longer me, he says.
*  It's us.
*  He told me he found peace with one of the show's biggest changes during an on-set conversation
*  with Michelle Yeoh, a practicing Buddhist, who plays the deity Guanyin.
*  As they talked, it settled on him that as important as his own faith was to the book,
*  the show would also need to honor the Buddha-focused mythology of the original Journey to the West.
*  It is the fourth storyline that offers Yu's solution to the problem of Chin-Ki.
*  It's seen at first only in viral snatches on students' phones, clips of a fictional
*  1990s sitcom called Beyond Repair.
*  Ji Hui-Kwan plays the show's problematic comic relief character, the hapless Freddy
*  Wong.
*  What could go Wong is his catchphrase.
*  Yu has made Freddy Wong his own exorcism, an embodiment in part of Freddy Gong, the
*  stereotypical bit part in an early Ryan Murphy show that was his first Hollywood role.
*  The only way to defeat your fear is to wear its armaments, he says, citing one of his
*  favorite books on acting.
*  That's how you steal its power.
*  But Freddy isn't Chin-Ki.
*  He's softer, less monstrous.
*  Eventually, we see the actor who plays him, conflicted, enjoying Hollywood success only
*  through a Faustian bargain.
*  As the Chinese herbalist's wife tells Jin in the book, it's easy to become anything
*  you wish, so long as you're willing to forfeit your soul.
*  This isn't a bargain Yang has ever had to make.
*  Winning the MacArthur is often a way for artists to step off the commercial hamster wheel.
*  But for Yang, it dovetailed with years of work for Marvel and DC Comics.
*  He has written storylines for Batman and Superman and a new superhero, the Monkey Prince.
*  He even wrote for the Shang-Chi comics he was once so wary of.
*  For the moment, he's stepped away from big comic commitments to work on projects like
*  Lunar New Year Love Story, a romantic comedy of a graphic novel, with Le Wen Fam.
*  The thing is, he does genuinely love superheroes.
*  He sees them everywhere he looks.
*  In Bishop O'Dowd's varsity basketball players, in the outrageous doomed faith of the boxers,
*  in the Monkey King learning to serve others.
*  They are less a single obsession than a totalizing worldview.
*  Partly it's his own sense of living a dual identity.
*  At one point, he told me about his effort, and his failure, to reconcile contradictory
*  elements of his faith by writing Boxers and Saints.
*  Sometimes the tension is okay, and you don't have to resolve it, he said.
*  You build a life from things that don't fit together neatly.
*  He compared it to a married couple's fighting comfortably about the same things, over and
*  over, for years.
*  I think the same thing can happen inside of a person, he said.
*  I think the same thing can happen inside of a person, he said.
