# Barney Frank on His Role in the Banking Crisis
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfye-f77LPc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is a daily.
*  When he retired from Congress, Barney Frank's legacy was a piece of legislation designed
*  to prevent another financial crisis. Now, because of what he's done since, many are
*  asking if Frank helped cause another financial crisis. Today, my colleague David Enrich talks
*  to Frank about the banking crisis and the unexpected role that he played in it.
*  It's Wednesday, March 22nd.
*  David, as you have been sorting through the causes and the fallout of this banking crisis
*  that we are still very much in the middle of, why is it that you wanted to talk to former
*  Congressman Barney Frank? Well, Barney Frank has been in the middle of so much that has been going
*  on. So back in 2008, after the global financial crisis, he was one of the people most responsible
*  for overhauling the system of financial regulation that was in place. And that was a real landmark
*  achievement that he had. And then in the years to come, he kind of switched gears a little bit. He
*  began to support a plan to roll back some of those requirements. And then right around the same time
*  they started doing that, he joined the board of a bank that stood to benefit from those rules being
*  weakened. And a few years after that, now we're in the present day, that bank was one of the first
*  to fail. A lot of people are concerned that it's one of the bellwethers that is setting off this
*  global banking panic. And so he's gone from being the guy who created the rules to the guy who
*  supported weakening them to the guy whose bank falls victim to this budding financial crisis.
*  Right. A kind of hero to villain, perhaps, journey in a pretty short period of time.
*  That's right. So I was really hoping to get a chance to ask him whether he thinks he made
*  some wrong decisions along the way and whether he thinks the decisions he made in some ways
*  contributed to the mess that we're now in. Hello? Hi, Congressman, can you hear us? Hello?
*  So I arranged to speak to him last Thursday, and we originally planned to do it by video chat.
*  It turned out he was in the Caribbean, his Wi-Fi wasn't great. We had some issues with, I think,
*  his cell phone and his iPad and his iPhone. All right, hang on. Let me make this louder.
*  You calling on a 627 number? Yeah, it's us calling.
*  Okay, hang on. I'm going to make it louder. And ultimately, we decided to skip the fancy
*  technology and just call him on his cell phone. This is obviously, I'm sure it's been a tough
*  week for you. Yeah. Oh, the toughest thing has been trying to get this back and stuff.
*  And just remind us, David, who was Frank when he becomes involved in the post-financial crisis
*  regulatory work that defines his career? Well, first of all, in his tongue, he's not someone who
*  has any particular interest or experience in bank regulation. Barney Frank was someone, he'd been
*  in Congress for, I think, 27 years, all of them representing Massachusetts. And he was one of the
*  most progressive members of the House Democratic caucus. He was also, or at least I thought,
*  he was also the first openly gay member of Congress, although that's something he corrected me on.
*  I was not the first openly gay member. I was the second. I was the first to volunteer it.
*  My colleague, Gary Studge, had been outed, but he was the first to acknowledge it. Three or four
*  members had been outed, but they all claimed that they really weren't gay. They had just been too
*  drunk. My view was, if you're too drunk to remember what you're doing, you're too drunk to do it.
*  And he was a very outspoken proponent of gay rights at a time when not everyone was doing that.
*  The reason he got into kind of the financial space in the first place is that he wanted to
*  do more to promote fair housing and affordable housing for people. And he thought that the House
*  Financial Services Committee, that that would be a good perch from which to push that.
*  Then, of course, the banking system starts to unravel in 2007 and 2008.
*  Take a look at the stock trading. It was fast and furious. That is a whopping loss of three and a
*  half billion dollars in market value. In 2008, when JPMorgan had to take over
*  bad stories. That's when it starts. Lehman Brothers is going bankrupt.
*  Merrill Lynch, sold in haste. They should start to hit the fan with the failures.
*  And the committee that he's on becomes instead a very powerful and important place from which he
*  can start tackling the work of trying to stabilize the financial system and then fix it so that a
*  crisis like that won't happen again. We are not the Securities Exchange Commission or the
*  control of the currency. We are not ourselves regulated. We formulate regulatory policy.
*  Understanding what happened, why it happened, what didn't happen,
*  those are essential elements of formulating policy going forward.
*  And of course, that crisis really stemmed from a downturn in the housing market,
*  which revealed that many of the country's biggest banks had invested a huge amount of their money
*  in the housing market in the form of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.
*  And when the downturn started, these banks lost so much money that the entire financial system
*  was suddenly at risk. Right. Well, and keep in mind,
*  though, it wasn't just about the banks making bad decisions. One of the real revelations of this
*  crisis was that regulators were completely asleep at the wheel. And so one of the things
*  that Barney Frank starts to look at in the immediate aftermath of this crisis is how do
*  we empower regulators to act more swiftly, more decisively, and to not just respond to a crisis
*  once it erupts, but to prevent it from erupting in the first place. And so Barney Frank teams up
*  with Senator Chris Dodd, and the two of them set out to enact this absolutely sweeping set
*  of financial reforms that's going to do everything from empower regulators to require banks to hold
*  greater financial resources, it creates a consumer protection bureau. But one of the biggest parts of
*  it is that for the 30 or 40 biggest banks in the country, so that's banks with $50 billion or more
*  of assets, there's this much more intense system of federal regulation and other requirements those
*  giant banks face. And so they have to undergo stress tests. They have to have much thicker
*  capital and liquidity cushions. They need to be in a position where regulators can look at them very
*  quickly and have zero doubts about their ability to survive a really intense economic or financial
*  storm. And David, what was so special about banks bigger than $50 billion? Well, basically, these were
*  the types of banks that had caused the 2008 crisis. And so this cutoff was meant to ensure that banks
*  like that got especially intense supervision and had especially high levels of financial stability,
*  so that when the next crisis came around, banks like this would not be on rickety financial foot.
*  So, soon after taking office, I proposed a set of reforms to empower consumers and investors
*  to bring the shadowy deals that caused this crisis into the light of day
*  and to put a stop to taxpayer bailouts once and for all. So do you remember the day that President
*  Obama signed the bill into law? Oh, good. Thanks to a lot of people in this room,
*  those reforms will become the law of the land. For the last year, Chairman Barney Frank and Chris
*  Dodd have worked day and night. So the emotional response when the president thanked both me and
*  Chris and how our staffs were so enthused and yeah, it was a very nice day, a great day.
*  And arguably, this is the crowning achievement of Congressman Frank's career. I mean, the bill
*  literally bears his name. It's called Dodd Frank. Yeah, that's exactly right. And about two years
*  later, Congressman Frank, who's 72 at the time, decides he's going to retire from Congress.
*  When I quit, I want the question to be, why are you quitting that? Why did you stay so long?
*  When I quit, I want the question to be, why are you quitting that? Why did you stay so long?
*  And so what was your plan? What were you going to do in your retirement?
*  Well, one, I got married and I planned to write mostly and speak. I had decided I wouldn't lobby.
*  Not so much ethically. I just didn't feel comfortable going back, frankly, to people
*  who had been my colleagues as a supplicant. Maybe it was an allergist, but I just didn't want to do
*  that. And then in 2014, he gets invited to return to Capitol Hill. And why is he invited back? Well,
*  he was invited back by his former colleagues in the House Financial Services Committee.
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to welcome the former chairman and longtime veteran
*  of this committee, Mr. Barney Frank. Barney, I've had your portrait hanging over me for just
*  about a year now. And during that time, I've concluded that just seeing Barney Frank without
*  hearing him is no Barney Frank at all. And at this point, Dodd Frank has come under intense,
*  sustained assault, not just from the banking industry, but also from Republicans on Capitol
*  Hill. The Republicans at this point control the House, and they're doing everything in their power
*  to make a public case against Dodd Frank. I'm pleased we all will be able to hear you today.
*  And I hope to hear you remind my Republican colleagues about just how close to the brink we
*  came in 2008 and about why Congress and the president responded forcefully with your namesake
*  legislation, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Democrats on
*  the committee are trying their best to defend the law, but are struggling, especially because
*  they're in the minority. And so Congressman Frank is invited to come back to Capitol Hill to testify
*  in defense of the law that he helped write. Chairman, it said that the financial reform
*  bill is as damaging as the health care bill. Well, my recollection is that this Republican
*  Congress votes on a fairly regular basis to repeal the health care bill. Well, where's your bill to
*  repeal the financial reform bill? If you have the courage of your convictions, let's bring it on.
*  I think the problem is that the public is in fact much more supportive of it,
*  particularly of the Consumer Bureau. Most of his testimony is spent defending the law.
*  Nobody is pointed to any abuse of practice that I can see. No one is pointed to any unfair intrusion
*  into the business models. And kind of shooting down many of the industry's arguments and the
*  Republican arguments about the harm that the intense regulation has supposedly done to the
*  banking industry and to the economy. But partway through his testimony, he makes what I regarded
*  as a really surprising concession. Should a bank's systemic importance be based strictly and solely
*  on their asset size? Well, I don't think 50 billion is, well, look, any number is arbitrary,
*  obviously, in the nature of the case. He said that the threshold at which the intense federal
*  supervision really kicked in, so that's at $50 billion, he acknowledged that he thought now that
*  that threshold was too low, that there was basically snaring too many banks that were not the very
*  biggest of the big in just an unnecessarily complicated and onerous system of regulation.
*  And he said that this threshold should be a lot higher than it currently was.
*  Basically, I think what you ought to do is to set a fairly high number as the automatic cutoff.
*  You always have to pick a number and it will always be somewhat arbitrary.
*  But yeah, I think that we should look at that 50 billion again.
*  So he's opening the door to the possibility of rolling back what seems like a pretty key
*  element of Dodd-Frank, this law that bears his name.
*  That's right. And it's around this time that Barney Frank is invited to join the board of
*  directors of a regional bank based in New York, and it's called Signature Bank.
*  And David, what should we know about Signature Bank at this moment that they ask Frank to join
*  their board? Well, like a lot of other large regional banks in the country, it was growing
*  very quickly and it was rapidly approaching having $50 billion in assets, which meant that as the
*  rules were currently written, it was either going to need to really slam on the brakes and stop
*  growing, or it was about to face a whole new intense level of federal oversight and all sorts
*  of new financial requirements that it looked upon very unfavorably.
*  And so at the time that this bank invited Congressman Frank to join its board of directors,
*  Signature had a tremendous amount at stake in the debate over whether or not to raise this
*  $50 billion threshold. So you were approached by Signature Bank. What was their pitch?
*  They thought I was smart, knew a lot about banking and had the right values.
*  They also stressed to me that they were the leading user of the low income housing tax credit.
*  They knew that housing had been my single biggest substantive policy concern.
*  And in 2015, Frank joins the board of Signature Bank.
*  This, of course, is both extremely common and extremely criticized. This phenomenon of former
*  members of Congress or former regulators who have spent their careers championing or fighting an
*  issue later on getting hired by companies who want to use those lawmakers' expertise
*  to navigate that very same issue. It's kind of known as the great revolving door in Washington
*  between government and business. So what does Barney Frank say about this decision
*  to join the revolving door system by being on Signature's board?
*  Well, first of all, he's very candid about why he wanted to be on the board.
*  I wanted to earn money. I had no pension. I had voluntarily decided not to get into the pension
*  plan in 81. I didn't want to lobby. So I was looking to earn money. I had been making money
*  from speeches and I had a good advance, a good $500,000 advance to buy my memoir. But I was
*  planning to live for many more years and I was looking for an ongoing source of income.
*  Over the seven plus years they served on Signature's board, he earned over $2 million.
*  And this is someone who, as he puts it, has devoted his whole life to public service.
*  He's left an enormous amount of money on the table compared to what he could have made if he was in
*  the private sector. And he pointed out to me that, look, he graduated from Harvard Law School.
*  For about $325,000 a year, which I must say for, you know, it sounds a little arrogant,
*  but for an honors graduate of Harvard Law School, $325,000 a year is not an excessive salary.
*  You look at most graduates of Harvard Law School, they go into big corporate law firms and they end
*  up making millions and millions of dollars. So for him, this is just what he's kind of got coming and
*  what he deserves. And the second thing, the broad point he makes, is that he doesn't see any particular
*  problem with the revolving door, at least not as it applies to him. And so he doesn't think that
*  there is any real issue with someone who had a very important hand in shaping financial regulation
*  and who has recently switched stances and is calling for at least a slight weakening of those
*  regulations. He doesn't think there's any conflict of interest or anything wrong with him going
*  essentially to work for that company. I don't understand the argument that anything that I
*  advocated as a member of Congress, I shouldn't join and try to promote afterwards. And by the way,
*  I was not on the payroll because I was not an employee. I was under no obligation to follow a
*  party line. In fact, I was literally an independent director. So the argument that I was somehow
*  for hire and that my opinion would be influenced, no. So David, what happens next? What happens
*  next is that Donald Trump gets elected president. And on the campaign trail and once in the White
*  House, Trump has made a mission out of destroying Dodd-Frank. He hates it. And with Republicans in
*  control of both Congress and the White House, the odds of Dodd-Frank not just being tweaked or relaxed,
*  but being destroyed entirely go from being kind of a Republican dream into something that is a
*  real possibility. And while he's no longer Congressman Frank, now he's just Barney Frank,
*  he endorses a compromise. And the heart of it is to increase the $50 billion threshold after which
*  a bank is subjected to extra intense oversight for that to go from 50 billion to 250 billion.
*  So what that means is that the number of banks that are subjected to this extra scrutiny,
*  it goes from a few dozen to just one dozen. Wow. It dramatically reduces the number of banks that
*  are coming under this intense microscope. Even Barney Frank has had some misgivings over the
*  this law. The fact that Barney Frank was such a well-respected member, especially on the left,
*  and it played such a pivotal role in writing this law to the first place meant that his endorsement
*  of increasing this threshold carried an enormous amount of weight all over Capitol Hill.
*  Even former chairman of the financial services committee, chairman Barney Frank,
*  when he wrote about the threshold, he wrote that quote, it is quote, arbitrary.
*  We're going to say this all day. Barney Frank even thinks the threshold is too low. It can be.
*  Republicans started citing this. And on the $50 billion threshold,
*  he said, I think it should be changed. Democrats started citing it.
*  Congressman Barney Frank said about 95% of Dodd-Frank as it is written will remain intact
*  after this bill passes. 95%. Again, this is former chairman Frank of his own signature law,
*  said the $50 billion threshold was arbitrary and a mistake. And he's right.
*  And in 2018, the legislation I'm signing today rolls back the crippling Dodd-Frank regulations.
*  President Trump signs it into law.
*  And you see almost immediately the banks start to take advantage of this.
*  Silicon Valley Bank, for example, goes from being right under this $50 billion threshold,
*  it more than quadruples in size in the space of just a couple of years.
*  Signature, where Barney Frank is on the board, goes from right under the threshold,
*  it more than doubles in the space of a few years.
*  Wow. So with Barney Frank's help, two of the banks that will eventually help trigger this
*  banking crisis that we're still living through are allowed to become much, much bigger.
*  With a lot less regulatory oversight. Correct.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, we all know what happened next. There is a run on Silicon Valley Bank
*  based on fears that its finances are rickety. Customers pull tens of billions of dollars out
*  of that bank. And then we start to see a run on Signature Bank. So how does Barney Frank describe
*  what was happening inside of Signature Bank over the past two weeks or so from his vantage point
*  as a member of its board? Well, in his telling, the problems really did not start until the Friday
*  afternoon when regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank. And what happened inside Signature that day?
*  Friday afternoon, we started losing deposits. Signature faced essentially a bank run of its own.
*  The bank officers are then working on trying to persuade people not to leave. That becomes clear
*  at first, and that's hard to do. Customers started yanking their deposits as fast as they could.
*  And the leadership was concerned that they needed to, A, try to stem the deposits,
*  and B, try to increase the liquidity to make sure we could fund those deposits.
*  So how bad was it on Friday? Do you have a sense of how many?
*  Well, David, what's the point? What do you mean how bad was it? Was it one to ten?
*  And as I'm pushing him on the details of what happened, he got pretty testy at times. And it
*  felt to me like he was really trying to distance himself from this whole mess.
*  I was not at the bank. I was home.
*  What did they lose in terms of deposits?
*  What I was like, what?
*  How much deposits did they lose?
*  I remember the number I got for it was 12 to 14 billion.
*  Something like 12 to 14 billion dollars of deposits fled the bank that afternoon, he says.
*  And that put the bank in a very precarious financial position heading into the weekend.
*  They began on Saturday, late Friday and Saturday, working on ways to get more liquidity.
*  But there was no sense of impending doom. There was some confidence Sunday morning
*  that we were stabilizing the deposits. And it came as a big shock to everybody when the
*  FGICA said, we're coming over Sunday afternoon. That was not good news.
*  That afternoon, he gets a phone call from the bank's CEO saying that regulators have
*  decided to seize the bank and shut it down.
*  I mean, that must have been an extremely upsetting moment for both of you.
*  Yes.
*  Can you tell me a little bit more about how you were feeling, how you reacted?
*  How I reacted? I said, oh, that sucks.
*  Somehow knowing you, Congressman, I imagine you were a little more colorful.
*  David, I hope your chances at a publisher don't depend on your
*  showing how we were upset when we were told our bank was closed.
*  Yeah, I hope so, too.
*  That's not a scoop. Yeah, I was disappointed.
*  He claims that this is a terrible mistake, that this is overzealous regulators coming in
*  to try to make an example out of Signature publicly for having dabbled in cryptocurrencies.
*  And that on the merits, the bank was on stable footing and should not have been shut down.
*  And remind us, what was the government's case for taking over Signature Bank?
*  Well, the government has not very clearly articulated the exact rationale.
*  But what they have said with both Signature and Silicon Valley Bank is that part of what
*  the government was trying to do was protect the stability of the broader financial system.
*  And what I and I think most people have taken that to mean is that both of these banks had
*  grown so big so quickly that their uncontrolled collapses really posed a pretty serious threat
*  to the stability of the entire American banking system.
*  And I think that brings us to the heart of why it is you wanted to talk to Frank in the first place.
*  So what does he say about the unique role he played in rolling back the original Dodd-Frank
*  financial limits, which encouraged Signature to grow so fast with less regulatory oversight
*  than it would have had under the law's original rules?
*  Does he think that any of the rules that were in place from the beginning
*  might have stopped a bank like Signature or Silicon Valley from ending up where it did
*  under government control, failing as a bank?
*  The short answer is no. He does not think it would have made a whole lot of difference at all.
*  There's nothing that the stress would not have predicted the problem of Silicon Valley.
*  That was going to be a case.
*  And to review, the rules that these biggest banks are subjected to, they have to conduct
*  these annual stress tests to make sure that they can withstand a severe financial storm.
*  They have to hold more liquidity so they're better positioned in the event of a bank run.
*  Paperwork. You have a significant paperwork increase.
*  Well, and a significant... The paperwork is not paperwork for paperwork's sake, right?
*  It's paperwork because...
*  No, 50 billion did not trigger any higher liquidity requirement of other rules.
*  And what Barney Frank said to me, which I found kind of surprising and not very precise,
*  is that the additional requirements that were rolled back, they basically amounted to a lot
*  of extra paperwork. He said they didn't really affect the underlying financial health of these
*  banks and that they wouldn't have prevented this current crisis.
*  I mean, can I just ask you, David, do you think he's right?
*  Based on my reporting, I don't think that he is. And the stress tests, for example,
*  the big banks we're supposed to be subjected to, are meant to detect situations kind of like the
*  one we're in now and to basically make sure that the biggest banks are able to withstand
*  really intense financial crises. The extra liquidity requirements that the biggest banks
*  face are supposed to help a bank avoid a bank run, which is exactly what just killed
*  Signature and Silicon Valley Bank. So I think actually that Barney Frank is being a little bit
*  dismissive about the importance of these rules that he had helped write and the potential that
*  they could have really made a big difference. But here's the thing, even if we grant that these
*  extra regulations wouldn't have made a lick of difference in this current situation,
*  nobody disputes the fact that in 2018, when the cap got lifted from $50 billion to $250 billion,
*  that set off an arms race among big regional banks like Signature and Silicon Valley,
*  where they doubled or quadrupled in size in the space of a few short years. And that is how you've
*  got these banks that are potentially posing a risk to the stability of the overall financial system.
*  And what does Frank say about that? This seemingly indisputable reality that the change he endorsed
*  to his own law allowed for even encouraged this rapid growth?
*  He acknowledges it.
*  The $50 billion acted as a deterrent to some banks for organic growth. No question. And I don't think
*  that was a good idea. I don't think it spares the bank to be at $80 billion rather than $50 billion.
*  I think banks are basically good things. They do good things for the economy. They're essential.
*  And if a bank is prospering by playing a good role, I think it's a good thing that they get bigger.
*  But Congressman, the thing that surprised me coming from Barney Frank, who had spent years
*  blasting the big banks, was that he thought it was actually totally fine and in fact positive.
*  And I'm saying that I don't see a harm in a bank having $80 billion. You seem to have any bank bias.
*  Oh, big banks, they're bad things. That's what you're saying.
*  I think, I guess that my starting point on this is that these two big banks failed and that that's
*  caused a lot of stress in the financial system and is scaring a lot of people about what might happen.
*  And so... But no, I take it back. That's not the point I was responding to.
*  He did not engage really when I pushed him on the fact that had these banks not grown as large as
*  they did, as quickly as they did, they wouldn't pose the same risk to financial stability
*  that regulators cited when they had to shut down these two banks.
*  Yeah. As I said, though, the point I'm trying to get across, maybe not very effectively, is that
*  the reason that SVB and Signature's collapses have been problematic and scary for the financial
*  system, I think, is because they were big, because they had grown so quickly. And...
*  Oh, no question. But that doesn't mean no banks should get bigger that it was bad. And by the way,
*  my prediction is that in two weeks, this will have been shown to be not a systemic issue,
*  that it will have been resolved by what the federal regulators did. Well, no, you think I'm
*  too optimistic. Call me back in two weeks. Seriously, let's write about this two weeks from now.
*  Basically, where we ended up is a disagreement about the severity of the current crisis we're
*  in. And his prediction was that this is something, it's kind of a blip, this is not a real financial
*  crisis. And two weeks later, no one will even be talking or thinking about this.
*  Yeah, there were two, three bank failures, but they didn't trigger anything like the threat
*  of 2008-9, nor did they require remedies anywhere near as extensive.
*  Yeah, although I think a skeptic or a pessimist might say that this financial crisis, if we can
*  call it that, is not over yet. It doesn't occur to you, David. That same skeptic might say that Elvis
*  is alive and is behind all this. Anybody could say anything. Of course, this conversation takes
*  place on a Thursday. While we're on the phone, another big bank, First Republic, got bailed out
*  by other banks. And then 48 hours later, over the weekend, Credit Suisse, which is one of the
*  biggest banks in the world, essentially has to be rescued by the Swiss government in this huge deal
*  in which they get taken over by another giant bank. So there's a quality of Frank burying his
*  head a little bit in the sand around just how big a deal this has all become and the role that the
*  growth of banks that he helped happen played in this crisis.
*  Yeah, I don't know if he's burying his head in the sand, and he might turn out to be right.
*  And it might be the case that by mid-April, no one is thinking about this as a huge crisis,
*  and this might turn out to be a blip. It's hard to predict the future, but it felt to me like he
*  was contorting himself a little bit to make an argument that the changes that he had endorsed
*  really did not have any effect at all. And so I asked him at one point in the interview,
*  you were the author of this very important legislation. You then support rolling back
*  portions of that legislation, and then you end up sitting on the board and getting paid by a company
*  that is a beneficiary of those legislative changes. And then that bank fails, and that has
*  caused a lot of concern about the stability of the financial system.
*  So what's your question? I mean, I knew all that. My answer is that nothing I did was in any way
*  positive of the failure, that the failure was not as systemic as people thought. In fact,
*  it was a failure mostly confined the damage to that institution.
*  And Frank really, at the end of the day, kept pointing to the political reality that he and
*  other Democrats were facing back in 2018 when Dodd-Frank was under attack in Congress.
*  In fact, the reason I advocated changes in part was I thought they were changes that did not in
*  any way diminish the importance of the bill and its impact, and were helpful to support politicians
*  who were under pressure to vote for more serious rollbacks. And that's why I supported the notion
*  of removing the politically most inflammatory parts of it that did not impact the political
*  that did not interfere with its impact. So that's my answer. And I think I feel vindicated by that.
*  He says that at the time, the decision to kind of make this concession on the $50 billion threshold
*  was actually a very savvy political move. It was basically made to save Dodd-Frank in its entirety.
*  And his argument was that by making this concession, Democrats and Republicans would
*  both support it and would kind of take the momentum away from some of the Republicans
*  who were most intent upon completely gutting or destroying Dodd-Frank. And so in his view,
*  this compromise, even if it's imperfect, it's still preserved Dodd-Frank for the most part in
*  its entirety. So the story he's telling you, the story perhaps he's telling himself, is that in
*  order to save Dodd-Frank, he had to weaken it. And saving Dodd-Frank was worth it, because that
*  will theoretically prevent a much larger financial crisis than whatever it is we're now in the middle
*  of. That's how he's thinking about what has happened here. That's right. Look, there is no
*  question that had Dodd-Frank been rolled back entirely, I think the financial mess that we're
*  now in would probably be a lot worse. But I also think at the same time that this is a bit of an
*  ex post facto justification by him for doing something that clearly has put him in a really
*  bright and uncomfortable spotlight. But he says he just does not really care what other people
*  have to say about him. One of the great pleasures of leaving elected office is that you are no longer
*  a subject to an impact from the opinions of people who you do not respect and do not know.
*  You know, at this point in my life, I don't care.
*  So David, I'm curious, what happens to Barney Frank's job on the board of Signature now that
*  Signature kind of is no more? It was vaporized the moment regulators seized it. The board was
*  dissolved and Barney Frank was out of his job. He seemed okay with that, though. He told me that
*  he was scheduled to have a board meeting for Signature in New York the day before our interview.
*  That meeting was canceled, the Signature was done. And instead, he was able to get an earlier flight
*  down to the Caribbean and just get back to being a private citizen.
*  Well, David, thank you very much. Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. We know a strike will be a sacrifice,
*  but we also know that our families have been sacrificing for far too long on poverty wages
*  in the richest state, in the richest country of the world.
*  America's second largest public school system ground to a halt on Tuesday,
*  as 30,000 school workers in Los Angeles began a three-day strike over what they say is
*  low pay in a city where the cost of living has surged.
*  The union representing the workers is demanding a 30% overall raise. City officials have countered
*  with a 23% raise and say that the strike will hurt students and their families.
*  One day out of school is one day too many. Two days out of school are two days too many. Three
*  days too much. During the strike classes will be canceled for more than 420,000 students.
*  Today's episode was produced by Will Reed, Mary Wilson, Diana Nguyen and Ricky Nowitzki.
*  It was edited by Lisa Chow, contains original music by Mary Lozano, Dan Powell,
*  Brad Fisher and Alicia Baetube and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsferk of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the daily. I'm Michael Bobaro. See you tomorrow.
