# The Man Who Counts Every Shooting in America
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3mV7YEuKpw)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  We want to begin tonight with yet another deadly mass shooting in America.
*  In 2023, the unrelenting epidemic of gun violence in the United States has claimed the lives
*  of more than 41,000 people.
*  Two people killed, dozens of others injured after gun violence.
*  The police commissioner again saying five people were shot, including two kids.
*  At least 18 dead and at least 13 injured.
*  And throughout the year, each and every one of those shootings, from suicides to accidental
*  shootings to mass shootings, was chronicled by a website.
*  According to the Gun Violence Archive, called the Gun Violence Archive, that has become
*  the most authoritative and widely cited source of data about the country's ongoing crisis
*  of gun deaths.
*  Today, a conversation with the founder of that site, Mark Bryan, about why he's dedicated
*  so much of his life to painstakingly chronicling a problem with no end in sight.
*  It's Monday, December 18th.
*  Good afternoon.
*  Good afternoon.
*  How are you, Mark?
*  I'm doing good.
*  I'm, oh sorry, we're good except, we're good except I just hit the microphone.
*  So yeah, we're ready to roll over here.
*  Good, good, good.
*  Well, Mark, thank you very much for making time for us.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  I just want to explain why we're talking to you.
*  We, the New York Times, the Daily, we cite this archive that you have created so frequently,
*  year after year.
*  And over time, it occurred to us that you, Mark, have become this really important but
*  largely unheralded and unseen authority on something that really defines the life of
*  our country and especially something that we think about at the end of every year, which
*  is the number of people who are shocked by a gun.
*  And it felt that if we could understand this work that you have been carrying out, potentially
*  we could better understand this epidemic of gun violence in a different way.
*  That at least is our hope.
*  Okay.
*  So just to start, I wonder if you can tell us your own backstory.
*  And I want to ask you in particular about your own relationship to guns.
*  Where and when does that story begin?
*  It actually began in about 1960 in Harlan, Kentucky.
*  There was not a lot of recreation for people in that era.
*  There was no cable TV.
*  Well, there was cable TV, but there were three channels and you had very little things to
*  do.
*  A lot of the fathers would take the boys up to the top of the mountain and to the garbage
*  dump and you would go shoot rats.
*  Your father did this with you.
*  Yes.
*  He took you to shoot rats.
*  And that would be like maybe five fathers, ten fathers up there at any given time and
*  mostly guys, but a couple of girls would be there as well.
*  And we were usually using 22 rifles.
*  So we would shoot rats.
*  How old were you when you were doing this?
*  Probably five, six years old.
*  I wonder what it was like to have a gun in your hands at such a tender age, five years
*  old.
*  I don't think anybody thought about that at the time.
*  Remember, that was a time that we had Jarts as a toy.
*  So we had all sorts of toys that we would now consider outlandish for a kid to own.
*  And then leap forward to Boy Scouts another decade later.
*  And you had a shooting range at camp.
*  And then later I started shooting, target shooting at a range and I did that for maybe
*  ten years, twenty years.
*  So I've just grown up around people like my father and all that where that was just a
*  common part of their world.
*  It was just one of the things that you did.
*  So how do you get from there, from being this young kid who enjoys shooting a gun to becoming
*  what you are now?
*  You know, the nation's leading chronicler of gun violence and its impact on people's
*  lives.
*  It doesn't seem like a straight line journey.
*  So tell us that story.
*  Who does straight lines?
*  That sounds so boring.
*  So I've been working in computers doing database work.
*  I was building databases for folks.
*  I was building small business computer systems for law firms and all that sort of thing.
*  So really the thought of gun violence was, it was, you know, you would see it in the
*  news.
*  It was one ambulance after another bringing in the victims of the shooting spree to the
*  emergency room at University Hospital.
*  You would see it when Standard Reviewer had their shooting in Louisville in the 80s.
*  Family members began arriving at the hospital to check on their loved ones.
*  Some were overwhelmed with grief.
*  Then after that...
*  Three students are dead.
*  Five others hit by bullets.
*  We had Heath High School in Kentucky.
*  Several people killed.
*  How in the world can we allow something like this to happen at our schools?
*  Please do something to keep this from ever happening again.
*  You know, we started seeing Columbine.
*  I don't even know if people are going to be able to walk back in the school again and
*  see empty chairs and it'll be horrible.
*  Virginia Tech.
*  A parent's worst nightmare, a student's worst nightmare, the deadliest campus shooting in
*  U.S. history.
*  This was just a ever building wave.
*  You know, that just, it's all combined, just gave me a sense of uneasiness, I suppose.
*  So once this all comes together in your head and you're starting to see the phenomenon
*  of mass shootings in the U.S. in that time period, what is crossing your mind?
*  Where does it lead you?
*  So 2012, that was kind of a weirdly defining moment because there was the Aurora Theater
*  And Aurora got just an insane amount of coverage as it should have.
*  But there was a guy in Tuscaloosa, Alabama that on that same week went to a bar and shot
*  17 people.
*  Nobody was killed, but the media did not cover it very well.
*  And that was the thing that annoyed me.
*  We'll just explain that.
*  Sounds like you're saying at the very moment that America is beginning to truly enter what
*  we now think of as this era of the epidemic of mass shootings, you are noticing that the
*  way the country decides to focus on and care about some of these mass shootings is really
*  different than the way we decide to focus and care about others.
*  There's a real gap here.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  That was a thing that was bothering me because as you started seeing the building of incidents
*  and started seeing just the aggregation of all of this stuff, that was started to make
*  it sufficient that something needed to be done.
*  And what I could see was the left was looking at banning things, looking at all of this.
*  The right is looking at nuh-uh, Second Amendment.
*  Because what I see is that is a war that's going to do nothing but escalate.
*  So I'm starting to look at there needs to be a conversation, and it has to be between
*  gun owners and those who oppose guns to come to a consensus on how to solve some of this.
*  But you can't solve a problem if you don't have a common set of understanding.
*  Right.
*  If you don't have that common understanding, you're just going to be throwing things at
*  each other.
*  You're never going to be able to find a solution.
*  And the media and CDC and FBI has incomplete data.
*  There was a knowledge gap.
*  And so there needs to be a systemic change to where there's a common set of knowledge.
*  You're watching this fight escalate, but without any real common source of knowledge about
*  what's really going on.
*  Right.
*  So what I needed was I knew that I needed to collect data.
*  I knew there needed to be a common data set.
*  I needed to have verifiable data.
*  And that's the key to make all this work.
*  So in your mind, if Americans and American lawmakers had a truly correct portrait of
*  what gun violence looked like in this country, then they would inevitably, correct me if
*  I'm overinterpreting what you're saying, they would be kind of shocked into action.
*  They would start to do something about it.
*  And at the very least, they would be able to debate this with the same data.
*  Yes.
*  I think that's a good way of looking at it.
*  All we wanted to do was get people talking, singing from the same page of the hymnal as
*  the southern phrase goes.
*  So once you decide that this is going to be your calling, organizing a data set around
*  gun violence that everyone can agree is trustworthy, what did you actually do?
*  Take us back to the start of this all and walk us through the process.
*  At first, I was writing blogs about gun violence, and I was using Slate data from their 2013
*  project.
*  Slate, the online news magazine?
*  Yes.
*  The Slate archive was a crowdsourced effort by Slate.
*  They started right after Sandy Hook.
*  And their goal was to put a face or a name to every person who had died in the year past
*  Sandy Hook.
*  And that had never been done.
*  Nobody had ever looked at that granularity before.
*  But boy, we found that it's really good for the big city incidents, but for small town
*  stuff it missed a lot of stuff.
*  And so I was bugging them on a fairly frequent basis.
*  Why did you not do this one?
*  Why didn't you do this one?
*  How come this one's not in here?
*  Well, describe that just a little bit more.
*  It sounds like you're looking for things that they're missing.
*  How are you doing that?
*  How are you finding these incidents that aren't in Slate?
*  Among other things, Alta Vista, if you remember it, and a couple of other older search engines
*  that used to exist.
*  I was going through them.
*  I was looking at different newspapers just from their online presence.
*  So you're basically combing the internet for shootings, pestering the people who have something
*  approaching a database.
*  Yes.
*  And so what prompts you to create your own archive rather than just keep working on Slate's?
*  Slate called me one day and said, hey, you know, we're going to drop this after a year.
*  What we really wanted to do was we wanted to do a snapshot of a year past Sandy Hook.
*  So their deadline, their drop deadline was in 2013.
*  And so I asked, could we take it over?
*  And we did.
*  And we started building it up.
*  We got better at it.
*  We've learned, you know, using Google searches and different search parameters, we could
*  dig through things a lot faster.
*  That was the processes that we started and things sort of blossomed after that.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Marc, you set out to create this database that would chronicle the extent of gun violence
*  in the United States.
*  Fast forwarding a few years, that's exactly what you end up doing.
*  It took a few years, but yes.
*  So I want to describe the resource that the Gun Violence Archive ultimately becomes in
*  your hands.
*  And I do use it a lot as a journalist.
*  It's not flashy at all.
*  In fact, it's kind of unflashy, but it's very clear about what it's doing.
*  When you go to the site, the first thing you see is a summary of data this year, which
*  is of course shocking every time you look at it.
*  We're talking to you on Thursday, December 14th.
*  Right now, your site says that the total number of all gun violence deaths so far in 2023
*  is 40,955.
*  The number of children the archive says that have been killed by guns is 283 so far this
*  year.
*  You can click on any of these categories and find the story behind each of these numbers.
*  If I click teens killed, I get the address of each of these shootings.
*  There's information about the victims, information about the kind of gun involved.
*  The level of detail is really extraordinary.
*  And so I'm curious, what lengths do you and your team end up going to, to track all this
*  information down and fill in these gaps in the record that nobody else is even trying
*  to fill?
*  We have a team of let's use the 24 as the total.
*  A good example of the extremes that we will go to is there was a shooting at a impromptu
*  concert in a field in either Alabama or Mississippi.
*  I'm not sure which one it was.
*  We knew it was on a road.
*  That was it.
*  We knew the name of the road and that was all.
*  And so that does not give you a good granularity to put a geocode on because you got a 40 mile
*  long road.
*  You really can't see where this occurred and even what town it occurred in.
*  So what we did was we went through all the different media that had tried to cover it
*  and they all were very good about covering it, but very bad about giving details as to
*  where this occurred.
*  The sheriff was of no help whatsoever.
*  So one report had the reporter standing in front of the cattle fence of the field.
*  And from that I took Google Street Views and drove the entire route looking for that
*  damned cattle fence and found it and matched it to the video of the Channel 5 Memphis
*  reporter.
*  You went down a 40 mile road on Google Street View.
*  Yes.
*  I didn't have to go down all of it.
*  Thank goodness.
*  We found it about 15, 20 miles in.
*  I'm matching the, okay, this has got a dent here on this top rail and this has a post
*  over here that's leaning to the side.
*  And if you look at the back, you'll see these trees are like this and there's two telephone
*  poles back there.
*  But that's the extent we will go to.
*  Fortunately, most of these things do not require that.
*  But every once in a while I burn an hour on an incident.
*  There are times that we need a name of someone who has died because I understand if someone's
*  injured, we don't need to have that name.
*  But when someone has passed, this is their last hurrah.
*  This is the last time they are ever going to be noted anywhere.
*  So I want to make sure I got it right.
*  So I'm going to have their name right.
*  I'm going to have their age.
*  I have mothers call me or email me and say, you didn't spell my daughter's name correctly.
*  Wow.
*  Or my son was 16, not 15.
*  So you end up hearing from the families of these victims themselves.
*  Oh yeah.
*  What are those conversations like when someone's calling you either to correct a piece of information
*  or to add to the archive?
*  You're on the phone with someone who's going through something very, very awful and raw.
*  Yes, it is hard.
*  That's the hardest part of what I do in a lot of respects in that I'm talking to mothers
*  that have lost their child.
*  I talk to mothers that are stressed, that are in a place they've never ever been in
*  their life.
*  There was a woman who lived in Nashville.
*  Her son had been shot and killed in Nashville.
*  At the Waffle House shooting a few years ago.
*  And I talked to her when her second son got shot.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Yeah.
*  I will talk to mothers who I got one, I can't remember what city she's in now, somewhere
*  in the Midwest.
*  And she was very, you know, she'd lost a daughter and then she lost another daughter.
*  And she was just about gone.
*  I mean, she was just, I could hear it in her voice.
*  And you know, you don't want to hear that.
*  I contemplated calling police for just a welfare check, but I ended up calling a group that
*  they knew people that were in there to talk to her.
*  So they did.
*  So she's better now.
*  Sadly, she has no more daughters to give to gun violence.
*  But you know, it was hard.
*  You know, it's hard doing some of that stuff, but that's part of the job.
*  Right.
*  It's a very strange situation you've gotten yourself into where you wanted to fill a gap
*  in our knowledge of gun violence and filling that gap means that you have just been saturated
*  in death.
*  And you're now dealing with mothers who have lost not one, but two of their children to
*  gun violence.
*  Yes.
*  This is sort of a sort of a virtual tombstone for folks.
*  You know, this is their this is that touch point for them.
*  The last thing that they're going to see every time they type their kids name in on the internet,
*  we come up, right?
*  We're going to be that memorial for them.
*  When those calls and Mark and those people, some of them, it sounds like are shattered
*  and they're talking to you about these small little details and making sure they're right.
*  On your end of that call, when it's over, how are you feeling?
*  You know, I am.
*  We see this every day.
*  And while I know that that, you know, you look at an emergency room doc and they see
*  this every day as well.
*  And they learn to compartmentalize their reality with someone else's reality.
*  And I'm pretty good at that.
*  At that compartmentalization.
*  Do I always succeed?
*  No.
*  Now, every once in a while, it may be harder, but for the most part, with very few exceptions,
*  I'm able to segregate that information.
*  How do your employees feel at the end of some of these days and some of these calls?
*  I have one woman who there was a shooting with a kid and she called us.
*  She says, I can't take this.
*  And I said, OK, you need time out.
*  And she goes, yes.
*  I said, so, OK, your job's here when you're ready to come back.
*  All you have to do is just sort yourself out.
*  Talk to me.
*  Let me know where you are, how your head is, and when and if you're ready to come back,
*  come back.
*  So about a month later, she calls me up.
*  She says, I'm ready to start again.
*  And I swear the second incident that she started reviewing was a kid that got shot in the face.
*  And I get a phone call and it was like, I'm done.
*  I'm like, OK.
*  You know, I understand that.
*  She didn't want to do it anymore?
*  She couldn't.
*  She said that she didn't want to.
*  She wanted to.
*  She really liked the job and she really liked what we were doing and trying to achieve.
*  But you know, you don't know what buttons somebody's going to have.
*  And apparently, we hit one of hers.
*  I mean, when you think about how often you end up being on the phone with people who
*  are in so much pain and as you sift through what is inevitably the worst kind of data
*  on earth.
*  What do you think keeps you from having the experience that some of your employees do,
*  which is just burn out?
*  Well, I won't say I don't burn out because that would be a fool's game.
*  There are times that I will, you know, it'll be time for a drive downtown just to see what's
*  going on and I'll just tootle around town or I live in an insanely beautiful area of
*  the country and I can take the convertible out and drive through horse farm country and
*  sort of freshen my brain up with that.
*  You find ways, you're saying, to mourn this?
*  Maybe I just adjust my head.
*  But it's how I reconcile in my head that I'm now looking at horses and foals and life
*  and green trees or fall foliage or whatever and I'm seeing a regeneration.
*  I'm curious about something, Mark.
*  Now that the Gun Violence Archive has become, through all this very painful and painstaking
*  work you and your team have done, this unique authority on shootings in the U.S., what do
*  you start to see in the data that perhaps the rest of us don't see or can't see because
*  we are not combing the internet for every shooting in this country?
*  What we are seeing, I think, and we're seeing it not just in Gun Violence Archive, but we're
*  seeing it in bars where you used to have maybe a bar fight, somebody got a bloody nose,
*  somebody got a black eye, and now a gun comes out.
*  What we're seeing is more anger.
*  You're on social media all the time.
*  I know there are good places on Facebook because I find them, but look at the rest of it.
*  It's anger.
*  Somebody's pontificated that they believe this.
*  In the past, that would have been somebody howling at the moon and everybody would have
*  quietly gone around them and ignored them.
*  But now there's 2,000 people that decided that, no, no, you have to have my opinion
*  on this very subject.
*  And that escalates anger.
*  So the baseline of anger is higher.
*  And you have more guns and more proximity to guns, more people carrying guns, more of
*  that, then it's inevitable what's going to happen.
*  And that's the trend that I'm seeing.
*  That's funny.
*  That is not the answer I thought you were going to deliver.
*  I thought you were going to tell me that regionally or in this gun, this age demographic, and
*  what you're saying is what you see in the numbers is, I suppose, what we all see right
*  now in front of us across the United States.
*  And you're calling it, I guess, a root cause of so much gun violence.
*  You're seeing people who are furious at each other, fast to anger.
*  Anger is one thing.
*  We've had anger forever.
*  Proximity to deadly weapons is a different animal.
*  You did not have 400 million guns or whatever the current number is.
*  More people have more guns.
*  There are those that think, oh, you're anti-gun or you're a gun grabber or whatever.
*  And obviously I'm not.
*  But I akin it to what we see with mothers against drunk driving.
*  You know, they're not against drinking and they're not against driving.
*  They are against that lethal combination.
*  And we're seeing that lethal combination with anger and proximity.
*  That's no different than intoxication and speed.
*  Two variables that when they come together, people die and they die quickly.
*  And you can't, well, I can punch somebody in the face and I can apologize as long as
*  I want to.
*  If I pull a trigger on a gun, they're dead.
*  Or if they're faster than me, I'm dead.
*  Mark, back to the purpose of the Gun Violence Archive.
*  We talked about this idea that ultimately you hoped that giving people more information
*  would mean that the country would act on the information and that gun violence would go
*  down.
*  And over the past 10 years, gun violence has not gone down in a very meaningful way.
*  And so have you ultimately concluded that data is not the solution to America's gun
*  violence epidemic?
*  That it's just a new way to understand the depth of it?
*  Well, it's not going to be the solution.
*  It was never intended to be the solution.
*  It was always intended to raise awareness of the issue and to let people understand
*  and then form their own opinions based upon it.
*  I think our value is in raising the conversation.
*  I think that's where our value is.
*  They may find that 17,000 killed, that's the price of freedom.
*  That's the price of us having the right to have guns.
*  That's their philosophy.
*  But what I just want them to do is they see the numbers.
*  I want us to be the folks that raised the conversation and made people smarter.
*  I think we're doing that.
*  Hmm.
*  You've succeeded in putting these numbers in front of people.
*  Yes.
*  And if you think of this as a very long-term project of putting these numbers before people
*  year after year after year after year after year, then maybe something changes?
*  How many years did we have the smoking pictures of lung cancer with the Surgeon General?
*  How many years did he or she announce numbers for cancer, numbers for all of that until
*  finally it reached a point?
*  And that's what we're wanting to see.
*  It's a slow process.
*  It's a generational process.
*  This did not get here quickly.
*  It is not going to leave quickly.
*  And I know that going forward, this is going to go on after I'm gone.
*  And I'm okay with that.
*  I'm very much to the philosophy of planting trees that you're never going to enjoy the
*  shade.
*  Hmm.
*  And when you say the shade of trees, what does the shade of that tree look like?
*  Still growing.
*  It's only a 10-year-old tree.
*  In 20 years, it'll be a 20-year-old shade tree.
*  And shade is information.
*  It is knowledge.
*  It is hopefully moving forward because of the constant message that we're trying to
*  give to people to educate them.
*  Well, Mark, thank you very much.
*  We really appreciate your time.
*  Well, thank you for talking.
*  This has been very, very good.
*  You've been my counseling session for this week, so that's a good thing.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Over the weekend, new details emerged about how Israeli soldiers mistakenly killed three
*  Israeli hostages in Gaza, an incident that the country's prime minister called a, quote,
*  unbearable tragedy.
*  Israeli officials said that the three hostages had either escaped or were abandoned by their
*  Hamas captors and approached Israeli soldiers on Friday in an effort to be rescued.
*  At least one of the hostages waved a makeshift white flag to signal that the group was not
*  a threat.
*  Nevertheless, Israeli soldiers opened fire on all three.
*  Their deaths have infuriated the Israeli public and deepened criticism over the conduct of
*  the Israeli military in Gaza, where its tactics have killed thousands of Palestinian civilians
*  over the past few weeks.
*  But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems undeterred.
*  On Sunday, he read in Hebrew from a letter that he said had come from families of Israeli
*  soldiers killed in the war.
*  Translated, it read, quote, You have a mandate to fight.
*  You do not have a mandate to stop in the middle.
