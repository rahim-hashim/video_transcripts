*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  If you listen to podcasts, which we know you do because you're here, you know that the
*  biggest challenge is finding great stuff to listen to.
*  The times wants to make that a lot easier.
*  We're launching an audio app, NYT Audio, a single place where you can find the shows
*  you already know and love, like the Daily, the American Life, Serial, the Run Up, and
*  discover a bunch of new shows that you can't get anywhere else.
*  I want to introduce you to one of them.
*  It's called The Headlines, and it pairs perfectly with the Daily.
*  As you know, the Daily tells one big story a day.
*  But the times is covering dozens of stories a day with reporters across the world.
*  And that's where the headlines comes in.
*  It captures even more news than the Daily does in just 10 minutes.
*  And all this week, we're going to give you the headlines right here on the Daily Feed.
*  After that, you can listen to it along with the Daily on the Audio app.
*  So how do you get this app?
*  If you're a Times News or All Access subscriber, you can get it for free by going to nytimes.com
*  slash audio app or by searching NYT Audio in the App Store.
*  If you're not a subscriber, the app is the perfect reason to become one.
*  And now, on to the show.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael O'Borrow.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, with a week to go before the US is expected to default on its debt, we look at the
*  state of the negotiations to lift the debt ceiling, the prospects for a compromise, and what
*  it will take to win over enough votes in both chambers of Congress to avoid an economic
*  disaster.
*  We turn, once again, to White House correspondent Jim Takerstein.
*  It's Friday, May 26th.
*  So Jim, let's just establish the state of play at the moment, because this is a very
*  live, fast-moving story.
*  We're talking to you on Thursday afternoon, with just a few days now left before the
*  US government hits the debt limit.
*  And we as a country run out of money to pair of bills, and we enter this never before
*  seen territory in which the entire financial system is in theory at risk.
*  So given that context, where exactly are we here at nearly 2PM on May 25th?
*  So it's a little bit scary where we are.
*  We can see the cliff from here, not very many days to go, until the Treasury Department
*  says the government will be out of ability to pay all of its bills on time.
*  And Congress and the President need to agree on a way to raise the borrowing limit so that
*  we don't go over that cliff.
*  And remember, President Biden has been saying for months that he would not negotiate over
*  the debt limit.
*  This needed to do a clean debt limit, just raise it without condition, full stop.
*  He wasn't going to bargain over this.
*  House Republicans said we're not going to raise the debt limit unless you also agree to
*  some spending cuts, because Republicans believe the government spends too much money, and
*  is on path to spend too much more.
*  Basically all those pretenses have been dropped.
*  The big developments of the last week are that negotiators from the White House and from
*  Congressional Republicans have been meeting almost constantly now to try to figure out
*  a solution and agreement.
*  And they have zeroed in on a series of compromises that provided they can actually reach final
*  agreement on them would be the bill that Congress could vote on that would end up raising
*  the debt limit.
*  So now we can see the contours of what the deal might look like that puts the brakes
*  on, stops the car, and prevents the country from defaulting.
*  Okay, it's worth noting that that was not at all an inevitable place for this process
*  to ever arrive, Dad.
*  Biden being willing to negotiate with Republicans, when we think back to him to the last time
*  you were on the show, the question was what route would President Biden take here in
*  this standoff, given that Republicans are causing it, would Biden refuse to negotiate
*  unprinciple as he had been and let the country go over the cliff?
*  Would he invoke some arcane legislative or constitutional provision to get around
*  the debt ceiling again, not negotiating, or would he enter talks with these Republicans?
*  So he has clearly decided the first two options don't make sense.
*  I'm curious why you think he has arrived at that conclusion.
*  First off, I do think some of those options are still on the table.
*  The president has said he definitively believes he has the power under the 14th Amendment
*  to declare the debt limit unconstitutional, but he just doesn't the easiest time to do
*  it to avoid the big problems of default.
*  So that's still possible, but Biden thinks it would be damaging.
*  I think that the president has made an economic first and then maybe political second calculation
*  here.
*  He did not want to be staring down Republicans all the way until the date of possible
*  default by saying, I'm not going to talk, I'm not going to talk, I'm not going to talk,
*  and allow the country to go over the cliff.
*  And he's had a lot of pressure from the outside to come to the table, business groups,
*  fiscal hawks groups, a lot of people that maybe the White House expected at one point
*  would support the president in this idea that, hey, we don't negotiate over the debt limit,
*  have not done that.
*  Interesting.
*  They basically said, you need to be reasonable, you need to sit down with Republicans,
*  and the polling suggests that the public is divided on who would be blamed if we defaulted.
*  And so I think the president reads that and reads the very strong possibility that a recession
*  would tank his presidency and has made the calculation that this is his best hope of
*  avoiding that.
*  So even though we know from history that Republicans know how to raise the debt limit in a quote
*  unquote, clean bill, because they've done it many times under Republicans, and they're
*  just refusing to do it now under a Democratic president, despite that, Biden has concluded
*  that standing firm on the principle that you just need to raise the debt limit because
*  that's what we do in Washington, that that is too risky because it might lead to a default
*  and he would get seemingly as much blame as the Republicans for the fallout.
*  So in a sense, he has decided to reward these Republican tactics because he feels he
*  doesn't really have a choice.
*  Yeah, I think that's basically right.
*  I think that the president has decided that the only way he can deal with these Republican
*  tactics is by engaging right now.
*  And that that's the best way to be responsible and avoid a default that again, would be terrible
*  for the economy, but also would be very, very bad for him politically.
*  Okay.
*  So with all that in mind, how in these negotiations have the president and the Republicans
*  led by House Speaker McCarthy, how have they gotten to what you're describing as kind
*  of close to a deal?
*  Let's get into some of the details of that.
*  So the first thing that it was get rid of a bunch of things that each side was asking for.
*  So Biden comes in for example and says, okay, Republicans, you care about the debt, let's
*  raise some taxes.
*  I've got a bunch of tax increases that I want to deal with.
*  And the Republicans said absolutely not.
*  And Republicans came in saying, hey, you know, your entire climate agenda, we'd like to
*  get rid of it and roll it back.
*  And Biden said absolutely not.
*  And so they started by just taking things off the table.
*  Things that neither side can remotely ever live with.
*  Those are the first things to be negotiated.
*  It's a little bit of theater.
*  They just fly away at medium.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  And while in public, they keep calling for it.
*  I mean, privately in negotiations, like it's never really been a possibility that they would
*  increase tax rates or that Republicans would repeal the inflation reduction act in all
*  of its climate benefits.
*  So now once they take things off the table, they start looking at the things that are on
*  the table.
*  And first off, there's a thing that the president said almost right away.
*  He'd be willing to do with Republicans, which is claw back some money spent in COVID relief
*  bills that he signed into law that hasn't been spent yet.
*  Republicans really wanted that.
*  And he said, okay, it's not very much money in the context of the federal budget, $30 billion
*  or something like that.
*  But it's something we can agree on.
*  Let's start with that in a good faith effort.
*  That feels smart because it's already been budgeted.
*  It doesn't seem like controversial.
*  Easy money.
*  Yes.
*  And the second thing here is placing limits or caps on federal spending.
*  In deciding where to cut, the parties have agreed that like some of the biggest things,
*  the biggest drivers of federal spending that the government has are off limits.
*  That's like Social Security and Medicare, big programs for retirement, for healthcare.
*  They're too popular with voters and President Biden in particular was hammering on Republicans
*  to take them off the table and they did.
*  So what they're focusing on instead is a category of money known as discretionary spending.
*  That's money for the military, domestic programs, environmental protection, education, aid
*  for the poor.
*  And the White House has agreed to put some sort of limits on that money going forward.
*  Going forward, meaning not to be cut at this very moment, but to be somehow limited or
*  capped in the future.
*  Well that's the debate, right?
*  So the current fiscal year runs through the end of September.
*  And the money for that has already been laid out.
*  So we're going to keep spending that money for this year.
*  So the debate is about what happens starting next year.
*  What Republicans want to do is spend less money next year on discretionary spending and
*  then limit the growth for 10 years at 1% for those programs going forward, which would
*  amount to a fairly large budget cut, little under $4 trillion over the course of 10 years.
*  Can you explain why that would be a cut because a 1% increase doesn't seem like a cut?
*  Ah, this is a Washington cut, Michael.
*  This is not like what you and I would think of as a cut, a spending cut when you are dealing
*  with Washington budget convention is anytime you spend less money than you were projected
*  to spend under official forecasts.
*  Ah, an imaginary cut.
*  Sort of, but I mean, think of it this way.
*  Prices are going up faster than 1%.
*  As we know, inflation's been very high.
*  So the cost of running any particular program gets higher every year.
*  So if the cost of running the education department is 5% higher next year, but I only give them
*  1% more money, they're going to have to cut some things in order to make their budget.
*  So it really is a cut.
*  Yeah, just kind of makes your head hurt.
*  I mean, this is welcome to my world, Michael.
*  So again, this feels like a pretty practical, rational route.
*  Well, there's a reason why discretionary spending caps are the centerpiece of these discussions,
*  a couple of reasons actually.
*  One of them is history.
*  Discretionary spending caps were the centerpiece of the budget deal in 2011 that ended the
*  debt ceiling standoff between House Republicans and President Obama.
*  But also, just sort of for practical budget terms, discretionary spending is kind of where
*  both parties go when they're looking for fiscal responsibility claims.
*  And there's also sneakily, I think, a little bit for the White House, a calculation here,
*  which is Republicans control the House of Representatives.
*  That means they get to originate spending bills.
*  And there was almost no chance in the mind of the White House that Republicans were going
*  to spend more on most of these programs next year than they were spending this year.
*  So part of this negotiation over spending caps is how much can the White House just
*  lock Republicans into what they think was going to happen anyway?
*  Got it.
*  So in other words, the Biden White House anticipates Republicans were going to put the whole system
*  on a little bit of a diet and makes them feel through this process like they're winning
*  that diet even though they always plan to be on the diet.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  And so the debate over the spending caps is really how restrictive is that diet.
*  And they disagree about how to spread the budget cuts, even the Washington cuts, if you
*  will, across the government.
*  So they're still debating just how much to cut spending and exactly which programs to cut.
*  But the overall idea of putting discretionary spending on a diet is like a centerpiece of
*  these talks and the debate over it is what's going to get them to an agreement if they do.
*  Got it.
*  So what else is in this emerging deal?
*  So there are some other things that are kind of floating around on the edges of the deal
*  that are likely to be in it, but are a bit more contentious.
*  For example, Republicans really want to put additional work requirements on some types
*  of federal aid to low-income Americans.
*  So whether that's needy families with children or people who receive Medicaid, healthcare,
*  average, there's already work requirements to some degree for these programs, but they
*  want to make it harder to get the benefits if you aren't working full time.
*  And what does that have to do with the death ceiling or spending cuts, or does it not
*  have anything to do with them?
*  Well, the most direct way that it affects it is that it will probably kick some people
*  off these programs, and it will end up spending less.
*  But Republicans also are claiming that by putting these requirements on, people will work
*  more and that'll lead to more economic growth.
*  Not great empirical evidence to support that, but that is an argument that they are making.
*  And on the face of it, these do not seem to be policies that Democrats or the Biden White
*  House would ordinarily embrace.
*  So what has the Biden administration said about these?
*  Are they as open to them as they are clawing back COVID money or imposing spending caps
*  on future spending?
*  The president has been very adamant in public that he's not going to cut a debt ceiling
*  deal on the backs of low-income Americans and people with children and Medicaid recipients.
*  In private, his negotiators are entertaining the idea of what you might think of as light
*  work requirements.
*  One idea that's been floated to me is maybe some sort of small change to who can receive
*  what's called tanuff, kind of the modern welfare.
*  But what his team is trying to negotiate is a very modest addition to work requirements
*  on the programs, whereas Republicans really would like something much more meaningful.
*  And that's a big point of contention in the negotiations.
*  So one way to think about these negotiations so far and where they've brought us is that
*  they're largely being conducted on Republicans terms.
*  I mean, the fact that these negotiations are even happening means they're happening
*  on Republicans terms, but they've been largely from what you're saying painless for Biden.
*  Because while he is giving in on some of these fronts, he's giving in on a relatively small
*  scale, right?
*  The work requirements seem more like gestures and fundamental changes.
*  The cuts don't seem enormous, maybe more symbolic.
*  And therefore the victories for Republicans are not enormous, but maybe they're big enough
*  because they're policy triumphs for their side that let Speaker McCarthy say I got Democrats
*  to do things they don't like to do.
*  So two things can be true here.
*  It can be true that this is, if not painless for the president, way less pain than he might
*  have expected.
*  Sure, some domestic discretionary programs might get cut in ways that the president really
*  opposes, but it's not going to be in the grand scheme of the federal budget, a ton of money.
*  And that would be a win for the president.
*  But it's also true that Republicans will have caught spending in something that they promised
*  that they would do and that would be a win for Republicans.
*  All of that said just because it's not terrible for either side doesn't mean it will be easy
*  for them to sell.
*  Both sides have a real risk here of their party and their supporters feeling like they got
*  fleeced.
*  And I think that is the sort of danger in crafting this deal that both sides are having to be
*  aware of.
*  How do you get something that you can sell as a win to your own party without making
*  it look like too much of a loss to the other guys and putting the whole thing in jeopardy?
*  We'll be right back.
*  Jim, given the tensions that you just outlined, let's say that in the coming days, maybe
*  over this long holiday weekend, maybe just in a few hours, there's a deal along the
*  lines that you have just described.
*  Focus through what happens and where it might get tripped up.
*  Sure.
*  Well, the sides will announce it.
*  And then the first thing that has to happen is it has to pass the house.
*  So assuming that he is broker, the deal speaker McCarthy will bring it to a vote in the house.
*  That could be trickier than you might imagine.
*  McCarthy has a very slim majority in the house.
*  Like four seats about as slim as it gets.
*  Yeah, he's trying to negotiate a bill that will make the bulk of his caucus happy and
*  that he can sell to almost everybody as a positive deal for Republicans.
*  But he has a very conservative caucus, the Freedom Caucus, which has more than 30 members
*  who are very unlikely, I would say, to support the kind of deal you and I just talked about.
*  They want much deeper spending cuts than what's on the table right now.
*  So what do you do without 30 some Republican votes in a foreseeable majority?
*  It means you need Democrats.
*  So if McCarthy loses the Freedom Caucus and a bunch more, I mean, he could lose 50 Republicans
*  is a number that keeps getting battered around in conversations with people.
*  But then that means they need 45 or 50 or more Democrats, depending on how many Republicans
*  they lose to join in and help pass this, which puts the kind of ball in Joe Biden's court.
*  And the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, have to lean on their caucus to get democratic
*  votes to help pass this thing through.
*  Let's just pause.
*  I mean, that's fascinating.
*  Even though this is not a bill that on paper, you can imagine many Democrats ever wanting
*  to support.
*  They start off from the position of Biden, I imagine, which is why aren't we just raising
*  the debt limit period end of story?
*  Why do we have to concede both fiscal and policy points to Republicans to get this?
*  They now need to give their votes to make this happen and avoid a giant debt crisis.
*  Yes.
*  And every Democrat in the House has signed a petition calling for a clean debt limit increase.
*  They really don't want to pair this with spending cuts.
*  But the argument that I think will prove persuasive in the event of a deal with House Democrats
*  and a lot of them is, hey, guys, this is our chance to avoid default.
*  We've cut the steel, the president cut this deal.
*  Here are the ones who've been talking all along about how dangerous it is to default.
*  We need to be responsible, suck it up, vote for a bill we don't like and prevent default.
*  So the argument is going to be a very simple argument to Democrats, which is we have a kind
*  of responsibility to the American people to do this distasteful thing on Republican terms.
*  Because otherwise, we will have a calamity on our hands.
*  Yes.
*  Exactly.
*  That will be the argument.
*  So to the degree that the deal reflects this, we'll see.
*  But I think the White House will be making the argument to Democrats in the House that,
*  oh, this deal isn't as bad as you might think.
*  It's maybe not any worse than we would have gotten in the normal appropriations process
*  or whatever.
*  They're going to try to make the deal look as good as they can while acknowledging that
*  it's not a clean debt limit increase.
*  And again, really just appealing to Democrats' sense of patriotism and not tanking the economy.
*  So Biden and McCarthy, very interestingly, will be making almost entirely opposite pitches
*  to their members in the House.
*  McCarthy will be trying to sell Republicans on the idea that this agreement is a big win
*  that they get work requirements, they get spending cuts.
*  Whereas Biden will be saying almost the exact opposite that the spending cuts aren't
*  that big.
*  The work requirements aren't that meaningful.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, Biden and McCarthy seem to have been crafting this deal with this very much in
*  mind.
*  So try to give your opponents something they can sell in the same way that you have
*  something to sell so that together you can get enough votes to actually pass the bill
*  and raise the debt ceiling and avoid default, whichever one says is their goal here.
*  So in order to do that, Democrats have to be mindful of both getting enough votes for
*  this to pass, but also making sure that Kevin McCarthy puts this deal on the floor.
*  Here's what I mean by that.
*  He could be very worried if enough conservatives revolt against him that they would vote to
*  depose him as Speaker of the House, get rid of him entirely.
*  So if the deal seems bad enough to a huge number of conservatives, McCarthy could fear for
*  his job and then he could decide not to put his own deal up for a vote in the House.
*  And Democrats absolutely don't want that because they want this deal to be voted on.
*  So Democrats might actually have a stake and unexpected stake in trying to make sure
*  that McCarthy can sell this debt deal to as many Republicans in the House as possible.
*  That's right.
*  And then you get into like wild possibilities there.
*  Like what if Democrats have told McCarthy as a condition of reaching this deal with him
*  that, hey, they'll supply votes to keep him as Speaker at least for this one time.
*  Oh, geez.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it could get wild.
*  Now a lot of people I thought you'd think that it won't come to this, that McCarthy's
*  not going to cut a deal that would provoke that large of a revolt, which is a consideration
*  in these talks, but it's out there and it's possible.
*  And so I think theoretically, all McCarthy has to do is bring a handful of Republicans
*  to the table.
*  And if he can get all the Democrats, well, then that raises the debt limit.
*  Got it.
*  So a lot of political perils exist here in the House vote, the first vote in this process
*  if we get a debt ceiling deal.
*  But what's your sense of how likely it is that this would eventually get through the House
*  and make its way to the Senate?
*  So I don't think anything is a given in Washington right now, particularly in this political environment.
*  Kevin McCarthy needed 16 rounds of votes, I believe, to become Speaker.
*  So it could be trickier than we're imagining.
*  But I think most people I talk to believe that if McCarthy and Biden really can come to
*  a deal, then it is very likely it makes it through the House.
*  Just because they each have the ability to command, you know, enough votes that you can
*  get to even a slim majority to raise the debt limit.
*  So let's assume that's right.
*  And then this process moves into the Senate.
*  Should we assume that because the Senate is controlled by Democrats and Biden is a democratic
*  president, that this will be a relatively light lift?
*  Well, the first thing to remember about the lift here is that you need 60 votes in the
*  Senate to get this through.
*  It's not a simple majority like the House.
*  You have to get past a filibuster.
*  So you need a combination of Democrats and Republicans because neither side has 60.
*  So that makes it trickier.
*  Another thing that makes it trickier is that there are a lot of very physically conservative
*  Republicans in the Senate who might not ever want to vote for a debt limit.
*  Dealing would be at least encouraged to try to tank this by the Republicans in the House
*  who didn't like it.
*  So you would lose a decent chunk of them, maybe even more than half of the Republican
*  conference.
*  Have you looked at previous debt ceiling deals and how they went through?
*  Got it.
*  So that means you would need a lot of democratic votes, maybe all of the democratic votes
*  to get it through.
*  And in that case, you have some problems.
*  I mean, particularly when it comes back to the work requirements, Senator John Fetterman,
*  for example, of Pennsylvania, freshman Senator, has been really vocal about the fact that
*  he did not come to the Senate to take out the problems of the budget on poor people.
*  And if you had pretty stringent work requirements as part of this deal, you'd very likely lose
*  him.
*  I think you'd be very likely to lose Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and a bunch of
*  those sort of more progressive senators if they think this deal is too much of a giveaway
*  to Republicans.
*  And so that's, you know, it's not a guarantee then either.
*  I will say, I think if it passes the House, the odds are very high that it gets through
*  the Senate one way or the other, but you can have a lot of sound and fury before it
*  does.
*  So if we assume that a deal emerges, gets announced and then needs to go through the legislative
*  process, it will be a rough and dramatic week ahead of us with absolutely no guarantees
*  other than drama.
*  Yeah, no guarantees of the drama is sort of like Washington slogan right now.
*  But it's true.
*  And I think in particular, you know, you'll have the backdrop of financial markets because
*  we don't know exactly when default would hit.
*  And I think that's the biggest wild card behind all of this is even if they make a deal,
*  can they get it done in time?
*  Because well, Treasury thinks it's around June 1st that it will run out of money, which
*  is next Thursday, which is next Thursday.
*  But they can't say for sure.
*  And so there's all these questions about like when would the drop dead date be?
*  And you could see a lot of late night votes.
*  You could see a lot of, you know, real consternation to pass this.
*  Right.
*  But what you're getting is that even if Congress clears these hurdles, which
*  sounds like they might, the complexity of the process, the delays built into it, that
*  carries its own risks.
*  I think we should talk about what the fallout would look like if these deadlines get missed,
*  if Thursday comes and goes.
*  And the US hits the debt ceiling and technically defaults.
*  Just give us a really brief picture of what that starts to look like on day one.
*  So there's truly a couple of things that could happen.
*  One is that we could hit that default date, but it looks like a bill is about to get
*  passed and sent to the president.
*  And so nobody freaks out that much.
*  Maybe there's like a little bit of a reaction in the bond market and stock market.
*  But really what it is is that, you know, everybody thinks it's going to happen and so they
*  don't freak out.
*  They kind of give us permission to miss the date.
*  Yeah.
*  But like, it's like, okay, I know you didn't make it to class just before the tardy
*  bell, but I saw you running across the field.
*  And so I'm going to count it.
*  Whereas there's also a possibility that everybody freaks out.
*  If it doesn't necessarily look like it's about to be signed sealed and delivered, there's
*  just a meltdown in financial markets, stocks, plunge, bond yields, spike, you know, it's
*  the first days of a global financial crisis.
*  It would be brutal.
*  And that could happen right away.
*  Now obviously the damage would be much worse if the default continues for weeks or months.
*  But even just a couple of days of a default could be really damaging.
*  And we don't know which of those scenarios it would be.
*  It's kind of like you have a third beer and you decide to get into the car and drive
*  home.
*  Like maybe possibly you get there safely, but it's a terrible idea and really dangerous.
*  And no safety-minded person would advise you to do that.
*  And so I think that's sort of where we would be if Congress makes it past this default
*  date without having sent a bill to the president that he can sign right away.
*  Right.
*  Three beers in, a fourth on the way, just not a good idea.
*  Exactly.
*  Call someone else to drive you home at that point.
*  Let's be very clear.
*  This podcast supports designated drivers.
*  Right designated drivers and fiscally responsible approaches to the dead ceiling, which
*  it looks like both sides are currently on a path toward achieving.
*  Right.
*  I mean, if we're just being really honest with what your reporting tells us, there is a
*  good faith effort underway here to avoid the things that you have just described.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot could go wrong.
*  Still, when you leave anything to the last minute like this, something can go wrong.
*  Certainly the tenor of the last couple of days has really pointed toward both sides are
*  trying to get something done in time to avoid the worst consequences.
*  And that has left everyone, I think, around these socks more optimistic that they will
*  avoid the bad consequences than maybe they were a week ago.
*  What's in?
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  On Thursday, after the latest round of negotiations with President Biden, Republican House Speaker
*  Kevin McCarthy said that a potential deal was close at hand.
*  But speaking to reporters, McCarthy emphasized that the deal would likely leave some members
*  of both parties unsatisfied, saying, quote, I don't think everybody is going to be happy
*  at the end of the day.
*  And that's not how this system works.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, a judge sentenced the leader of the Oathkeeper's militia, Stuart Rhodes,
*  to 18 years in prison for his role in the January 6th riot at the US Capitol.
*  The most severe penalty so far to stem from the assault.
*  The sentence was the result of Rhodes' conviction late last year on charges of seditious conspiracy
*  for plotting to keep former President Trump in power after the 2020 election.
*  Rhodes has expressed no remorse for that plot, and at his sentencing, called himself, quote,
*  a political prisoner.
*  In the latest evidence that corporations are worried about artificial intelligence, Microsoft
*  has proposed a series of government regulations to limit potential risks from the technology.
*  Those regulations include a requirement that AI can be turned off when used in critical
*  infrastructure, and for creating a system of labels to make clear when either an image
*  or video is generated by AI.
*  The proposals are notable because Microsoft is building AI into many of its products,
*  including its search engine known as Bing.
