# The Ticking Clock of a U.S. Debt Default
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQKlUAX_Eo8)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  If you listen to podcasts, which we know you do because you're here, you know that the
*  biggest challenge is finding great stuff to listen to.
*  The Times wants to make that a lot easier.
*  We're launching an audio app, NYT Audio, a single place where you can find the shows
*  you already know and love, like The Daily, This American Life, Serial, The Run-Up, and
*  discover a bunch of new shows that you can't get anywhere else.
*  I want to introduce you to one of them.
*  It's called The Headlines, and it pairs perfectly with The Daily.
*  As you know, The Daily tells one big story a day, but The Times is covering dozens of
*  stories a day with reporters across the world, and that's where The Headlines comes in.
*  It captures even more news than The Daily does in just 10 minutes.
*  And all this week, we're going to give you The Headlines right here on The Daily feed.
*  After that, you can listen to it, along with The Daily, on the audio app.
*  So how do you get this app?
*  If you're a Times, News, or All Access subscriber, you can get it for free by going to nytimes.com
*  slash audio app, or by searching NYT Audio in the App Store.
*  If you're not a subscriber, the app is the perfect reason to become one.
*  And now, on to the show.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, with a week to go before the U.S. is expected to default on its debt, we look at
*  the state of the negotiations to lift the debt ceiling, the prospects for a compromise,
*  and what it will take to win over enough votes in both chambers of Congress to avoid an economic
*  disaster.
*  We turn once again to White House correspondent Jim Tankersley.
*  It's Friday, May 26th.
*  So Jim, let's just establish the state of play at the moment, because this is a very
*  live, fast-moving story.
*  We're talking to you on Thursday afternoon, with just a few days now left before the U.S.
*  government hits the debt limit.
*  And we as a country run out of money to pay our bills, and we enter this never-before-seen
*  territory in which the entire financial system is, in theory, at risk.
*  So given that context, where exactly are we here at nearly 2 p.m. on May 25th?
*  So it's a little bit scary where we are.
*  We can see the cliff from here, not very many days to go, until the Treasury Department
*  says that the government will be out of ability to pay all of its bills on time.
*  And Congress and the President need to agree on a way to raise the borrowing limit so that
*  we don't go over that cliff.
*  And remember, President Biden has been saying for months that he would not negotiate over
*  the debt limit.
*  Congress needed to do a clean debt limit, just raise it without condition, full stop.
*  He wasn't going to bargain over this.
*  House Republicans said, we're not going to raise the debt limit unless you also agree
*  to some spending cuts, because Republicans believe the government spends too much money
*  and is on path to spend too much more.
*  Basically all those pretenses have been dropped.
*  The big developments of the last week are that negotiators from the White House and
*  from congressional Republicans have been meeting almost constantly now to try to figure out
*  a solution, an agreement.
*  And they have zeroed in on a series of compromises that provided they can actually reach final
*  agreement on them, would be the bill that Congress could vote on that would end up raising
*  the debt limit.
*  So now we can see the contours of what the deal might look like that puts the brakes
*  on, stops the car and prevents the country from defaulting.
*  OK, it's worth noting that that was not at all an inevitable place for this process to
*  have arrived at.
*  Biden being willing to negotiate with Republicans, when we think back to the last time you were
*  on the show, the question was what route would President Biden take here in this standoff,
*  given that Republicans are causing it?
*  Would Biden refuse to negotiate on principle as he had been and let the country go over
*  the cliff?
*  Would he invoke some arcane legislative or constitutional provision to get around the
*  debt ceiling?
*  Again, not negotiating.
*  Or would he enter talks with these Republicans?
*  So he has clearly decided the first two options don't make sense.
*  I'm curious why you think he has arrived at that conclusion.
*  First off, I do think some of those options are still on the table.
*  The president has said he definitively believes he has the power under the 14th Amendment
*  to declare the debt limit unconstitutional, but he just doesn't think he has time to do
*  it to avoid the big problems of default.
*  So that's still possible, but Biden thinks it would be damaging.
*  Right.
*  I think the president has made an economic first and then maybe political second calculation
*  here. He did not want to be staring down Republicans all the way until the date of possible
*  default by saying, I'm not going to talk, I'm not going to talk, I'm not going to talk
*  and allow the country to go over the cliff.
*  And he's had a lot of pressure from the outside to come to the table.
*  Business groups, fiscal hawks, groups, a lot of people that maybe the White House expected
*  at one point would support the president in this idea that, hey, we don't negotiate over
*  the debt limit, have not done that.
*  Interesting.
*  They basically said, you need to be reasonable.
*  You need to sit down with Republicans.
*  And the polling suggests that the public is divided on who would be blamed if we defaulted.
*  And so I think the president reads that and reads the very strong possibility that a
*  recession would tank his presidency and has made the calculation that this is his best
*  hope of avoiding that.
*  Hmm.
*  So even though we know from history that Republicans know how to raise the debt limit in a
*  quote unquote clean bill, because they've done it many times under Republicans and they're
*  just refusing to do it now under a Democratic president.
*  Despite that, Biden has concluded that standing firm on the principle that you just need to
*  raise the debt limit, because that's what we do in Washington, that that is too risky
*  because it might lead to a default and he would get seemingly as much blame as the
*  Republicans for the fallout.
*  So in a sense, he has decided to reward these Republican tactics because he feels he
*  doesn't really have a choice.
*  Yeah, I think that's basically right.
*  I think that the president has decided that the only way he can deal with these Republican
*  tactics is by engaging right now and that that's the best way to be responsible and
*  avoid a default that again would be terrible for the economy, but also would be very,
*  very bad for him politically.
*  OK, so with all that in mind, how in these negotiations have the president and the
*  Republicans led by House Speaker McCarthy, how have they gotten to what you're describing
*  as kind of close to a deal?
*  Let's get into some of the details of that.
*  Well, so the first thing that it was get rid of a bunch of things that each side was
*  asking for.
*  So Biden comes in, for example, and says, OK, Republicans, you care about the debt.
*  Let's raise some taxes.
*  I've got a bunch of tax increases that I want to deal with.
*  And Republicans said, absolutely not.
*  And Republicans came in saying, hey, you know, your entire climate agenda, we'd like to
*  get rid of it and roll it back.
*  And Biden said, absolutely not.
*  And so they started by just taking things off the table.
*  Things that neither side can remotely ever live with.
*  Those are the first things to be negotiated.
*  It's a little bit of theater.
*  They just fly away immediately.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  And while in public, they keep calling for it, I mean, privately in negotiations, like
*  it's never really been a possibility that they would increase tax rates or that Republicans
*  would repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and all of its climate benefits.
*  So now, once they take things off the table, they start looking at the things that are
*  on the table.
*  And first off, there's a thing that the president said almost right away he'd be willing
*  to do with Republicans, which is claw back some money spent in covid relief bills that
*  he signed into law that hasn't been spent yet.
*  Republicans really wanted that.
*  And he said, OK, it's not very much money in the context of the federal budget.
*  Thirty billion dollars or something like that.
*  But it's something we can agree on.
*  Let's start with that in a good faith effort.
*  That feels smart because it's already been budgeted.
*  It doesn't seem that controversial.
*  Easy money. Yes.
*  In the terms of a budget negotiation, pretty easy money.
*  And the second thing here is placing limits or caps on federal spending in deciding where
*  to cut. The parties have agreed that like some of the biggest things, the biggest drivers
*  of federal spending that the government has are off limits.
*  That's like Social Security and Medicare, big programs for retirement, for health care.
*  They're too popular with voters.
*  And President Biden in particular was hammering on Republicans to take them off the table.
*  And they did. So what they're focusing on instead is a category of money known as
*  discretionary spending.
*  That's money for the military, domestic programs like environmental protection, education,
*  aid for the poor. And the White House has agreed to put some sort of limits on that money
*  going forward. Going forward, meaning not to be cut at this very moment, but to be somehow
*  limited or capped in the future.
*  Well, that's the debate. Right. So the current fiscal year runs through the end of September.
*  And the money for that has already been laid out.
*  So we're going to keep spending that money for this year.
*  So the debate is about what happens starting next year.
*  What Republicans want to do is spend less money next year on discretionary spending and then
*  limit the growth for 10 years at 1 percent for those programs going forward, which would
*  amount to a fairly large budget cut, little under four trillion dollars over the course of 10
*  years. Can you explain why that would be a cut?
*  Because a one percent increase doesn't seem like a cut.
*  Ah, this is a Washington cut, Michael.
*  This is not like what you and I would think of as a cut.
*  A spending cut when you are dealing with Washington budget convention is anytime you spend
*  less money than you were projected to spend under official forecasts.
*  Ah, an imaginary cut.
*  Sort of. But I mean, think of it this way.
*  Prices are going up faster than 1 percent, as we know.
*  Inflation has been very high.
*  So the cost of running any particular program gets higher every year.
*  So if the cost of running the education department is five percent higher next year, but I
*  only give them one percent more money, they're going to have to cut some things in order
*  to make their budget. So it really is a cut.
*  Yeah, just kind of makes your head hurt.
*  I mean, this is welcome to my world, Michael.
*  So, again, this feels like a pretty practical, rational route.
*  Well, there's a reason why discretionary spending caps are the centerpiece of these
*  discussions. A couple of reasons, actually.
*  One of them is history.
*  Discretionary spending caps were the centerpiece of the budget deal in 2011 that ended the
*  debt ceiling standoff between House Republicans and President Obama.
*  But also just sort of for practical budget terms, discretionary spending is kind of where
*  both parties go when they're looking for fiscal responsibility claims.
*  And there's also sneakily, I think, a little bit for the White House, a calculation here,
*  which is Republicans control the House of Representatives.
*  That means they get to originate spending bills.
*  And there was almost no chance in the mind of the White House that Republicans were going
*  to spend more on most of these programs next year than they were spending this year.
*  So part of this negotiation over spending caps is how much can the White House just
*  lock Republicans into what they think was going to happen anyway?
*  Got it. So in other words, the Biden White House anticipates Republicans were going to
*  put the whole system on a little bit of a diet and makes them feel through this process
*  like they're winning that diet, even though they always plan to be on the diet.
*  Right. Exactly. And so the debate over the spending caps is really how restrictive is
*  that diet. And they disagree about how to spread the budget cuts, even the Washington
*  cuts, if you will, across the government.
*  So they're still debating just how much to cut spending and exactly which programs to
*  cut. But the overall idea of putting discretionary spending on a diet is like a centerpiece
*  of these talks. And the debate over it is what's going to get them to an agreement if
*  they do. Got it.
*  So what else is in this emerging deal?
*  So there are some other things that are kind of floating around on the edges of the deal
*  that are likely to be in it, but are a bit more contentious.
*  For example, Republicans really want to put additional work requirements on some types
*  of federal aid to low income Americans.
*  So whether that's needy families with children or people who receive Medicaid, health care
*  average, there's already work requirements to some degree for these programs.
*  But they want to make it harder to get the benefits if you aren't working full time.
*  And what does that have to do with the debt ceiling or spending cuts?
*  Or does it not have anything to do with them?
*  Well, the most direct way that it affects it is that it will probably kick some people off
*  these programs. It will end up spending less.
*  Got it.
*  Republicans also are claiming that by putting these requirements on, people will work more
*  and that'll lead to more economic growth.
*  Not great empirical evidence to support that, but that is an argument that they are making.
*  Got it. And on the face of it, these do not seem to be policies that Democrats or the
*  Biden White House would ordinarily embrace.
*  So what has the Biden administration said about these?
*  Are they as open to them as they are clawing back COVID money or imposing spending caps
*  on future spending?
*  The president has been very adamant in public that he's not going to cut a debt ceiling
*  deal on the backs of low income Americans and people with children, Medicaid recipients.
*  In private, his negotiators are entertaining the idea of what you might think of as light
*  work requirements. One idea that's been floated to me is maybe some sort of small change to
*  who can receive what's called TANF, kind of the modern welfare.
*  But what his team is trying to negotiate is a very sort of modest addition to work
*  requirements on the programs, whereas Republicans really would like something much more
*  meaningful. And that's a big point of contention in the negotiations.
*  So one way to think about these negotiations so far and where they've brought us is that
*  they're largely being conducted on Republicans terms.
*  The fact that these negotiations are even happening means they're happening on
*  Republicans terms. But they've been largely, from what you're saying, painless for
*  Biden because while he is giving in on some of these fronts, he's giving in on a
*  relatively small scale.
*  The work requirements seem more like gestures and fundamental changes.
*  The cuts don't seem enormous, maybe more symbolic.
*  And therefore, the victories for Republicans are not enormous, but maybe they're big
*  enough because their policy triumphs for their side that let Speaker McCarthy say,
*  I got Democrats to do things they don't like to do.
*  So two things can be true here.
*  It can be true that this is, if not painless for the president, way less pain than he
*  might have expected.
*  Sure, some domestic discretionary programs might get cut in ways that the president
*  really opposes. But, you know, it's not going to be in the grand scheme of the federal
*  budget, a ton of money.
*  And that would be a win for the president.
*  But it's also true that Republicans will have cut spending.
*  It's something that they promised that they would do.
*  And that would be a win for Republicans.
*  All of that said, just because it's not terrible for either side doesn't mean it will be
*  easy for them to sell.
*  Both sides have a real risk here of their party and their supporters feeling like they
*  got fleeced.
*  And I think that is the sort of danger in crafting this deal that both sides are having
*  to be aware of. How do you get something that you can sell as a win to your own party
*  without making it look like too much of a loss to the other guys and putting the whole
*  thing in jeopardy?
*  We'll be right back.
*  Jim, given the tensions that you just outlined, let's say that in the coming days, maybe
*  over this long holiday weekend, maybe just in a few hours, there's a deal along the
*  lines that you have just described.
*  Walk us through what happens and where it might get tripped up.
*  Sure. Well, the sides will announce it.
*  And then the first thing that has to happen is it has to pass the House.
*  So assuming that he is the president, it's going to be a win.
*  Pass the House.
*  So assuming that he is brokered the deal, Speaker McCarthy will bring it to a vote in
*  the House. That could be trickier than you might imagine.
*  McCarthy has a very slim majority in the House.
*  Like four seats, about as slim as it gets.
*  Yeah. He's trying to negotiate a bill that will make the bulk of his caucus happy and
*  that he can sell to almost everybody as a positive deal for Republicans.
*  But he has a very conservative caucus, the Freedom Caucus, which has more than 30
*  members who are very unlikely, I would say, to support the kind of deal you and I just
*  talked about. They want much deeper spending cuts than what's on the table right now.
*  So what do you do without 30 some Republican votes in a four seat majority?
*  It means you need Democrats.
*  So if McCarthy loses the Freedom Caucus and a bunch more, I mean, he could lose 50
*  Republicans is a number that keeps getting battered around in conversations with people.
*  But then that means they need 45 or 50 or more Democrats, depending on how many
*  Republicans they lose, to join in and help pass this, which puts the kind of ball in
*  Joe Biden's court. He and the House Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries, have to lean on
*  their caucus to get Democratic votes to help pass this thing through.
*  Let's just pause. I mean, that's fascinating.
*  Even though this is not a bill that on paper you can imagine many Democrats ever
*  wanting to support, they start off from the position of Biden, I imagine, which is why
*  aren't we just raising the debt limit period?
*  End of story. Why do we have to concede both fiscal and policy points to Republicans to
*  get this? They now need to give their votes to make this happen and avoid a giant debt
*  crisis.
*  Yes. And every Democrat in the House has signed a petition calling for a clean debt
*  limit increase. They really don't want to pair this with spending cuts.
*  But the argument that I think will prove persuasive in the event of a deal with House
*  Democrats and a lot of them is, hey, guys, this is our chance to avoid default.
*  We've cut this deal. The president cut this deal.
*  We're the ones who've been talking all along about how dangerous it is to default.
*  We need to be responsible, suck it up, vote for a bill we don't like and prevent
*  default.
*  So the argument is going to be a very simple argument to Democrats, which is we have a
*  kind of responsibility to the American people to do this distasteful thing on Republican
*  terms, because otherwise we will have a calamity on our hands.
*  Yes, exactly. That will be the argument.
*  And also, to the degree that the deal reflects this, we'll see.
*  But I think the White House will be making the argument to Democrats in the House that
*  this deal isn't as bad as you might think.
*  You know, it's maybe not any worse than we would have gotten in the normal appropriations
*  process or whatever.
*  They're going to try to make the deal look as good as they can while acknowledging that
*  it's not a clean debt limit increase.
*  And again, really just appealing to Democrats sense of patriotism and not tanking the
*  economy.
*  So Biden and McCarthy, very interestingly, will be making almost entirely opposite pitches
*  to their members in the House.
*  McCarthy will be trying to sell Republicans on the idea that this agreement is a big
*  win, that they get work requirements, they get spending cuts.
*  Whereas Biden will be saying almost the exact opposite, that the spending cuts aren't
*  that big, the work requirements aren't that meaningful.
*  Yes. I mean, Biden and McCarthy seem to have been crafting this deal with this very much
*  in mind. You try to give your opponents something they can sell in the same way that you
*  have something to sell so that together you can get enough votes to actually pass the
*  bill and raise the debt ceiling and avoid default, which everyone says is their goal
*  here. So in order to do that, Democrats have to be mindful of the fact that they're
*  mindful of both getting enough votes for this to pass, but also making sure that Kevin
*  McCarthy puts this deal on the floor.
*  Here's what I mean by that.
*  He could be very worried if enough conservatives revolt against him, that they would
*  vote to depose him as Speaker of the House, get rid of him entirely.
*  So if the deal seems bad enough to a huge number of conservatives, McCarthy could fear
*  for his job and then he could decide not to put his own deal up for a vote in the
*  House. And Democrats absolutely don't want that because they want this deal to be voted
*  on.
*  So Democrats might actually have a stake, an unexpected stake, in trying to make sure
*  that McCarthy can sell this debt deal to as many Republicans in the House as possible.
*  That's right. And then you get into like wild possibilities there.
*  Like, what if Democrats have told McCarthy as a condition of reaching this deal with
*  a deal that would provoke that large of a revolt, which is a consideration in these
*  talks. But it's out there and it's possible.
*  And so I think theoretically all McCarthy has to do is bring a handful of Republicans
*  to the table and if he can get all the Democrats, well, then that raises the debt
*  limit.
*  Got it. So a lot of political perils exist here in the House of Representatives.
*  And I think that's a good point.
*  I think that's a good point.
*  I think that's a good point.
*  I think that's a good point.
*  I think that's a good point.
*  So a lot of political perils exist here in the House vote, the first vote in this
*  process, if we get a debt ceiling deal.
*  But what's your sense of how likely it is that this would eventually get through the
*  House and make its way to the Senate?
*  So I don't think anything is a given in Washington right now, particularly in this
*  political environment.
*  You know, Kevin McCarthy needed 16 rounds of votes, I believe, to become speaker.
*  So it could be trickier than we're imagining.
*  But I think most people I talk to believe that if McCarthy and Biden really can come
*  to a deal, then it is very likely it makes it through the House just because they each
*  have the ability to command enough votes that you can get to even a slim majority to
*  raise the debt limit.
*  So let's assume that's right.
*  And then this process moves into the Senate.
*  Should we assume that because the Senate is controlled by Democrats and Biden is a
*  Democratic president, that this will be a relatively light lift?
*  Well, the first thing to remember about the lift here is that you need 60 votes in the
*  Senate to get this through.
*  It's not a simple majority like the House.
*  You have to get past a filibuster.
*  So you need a combination of Democrats and Republicans because neither side has 60.
*  Right.
*  So that makes it trickier.
*  Another thing that makes it trickier is that there are a lot of very fiscally conservative
*  Republicans in the Senate who might not ever want to vote for a debt limit deal and would
*  be at least encouraged to try to tank this by the Republicans in the House who didn't
*  like it. So you would lose a decent chunk of them, maybe even more than half of the
*  Republican conference.
*  If you look at previous debt ceiling deals and how they went through.
*  Got it. So that means you would need a lot of Democratic votes, maybe all of the Democratic
*  votes to get it through.
*  And in that case, you have some problems.
*  I mean, particularly when it comes back to the work requirements.
*  Senator John Fetterman, for example, of Pennsylvania, freshman senator, has been really vocal
*  about the fact that he did not come to the Senate to take out the problems of the budget
*  on poor people. And if you had pretty stringent work requirements as part of this deal, you'd
*  very likely lose him.
*  I think you'd be very likely to lose Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and a bunch of
*  the sort of more progressive senators if they think this deal is too much of a giveaway
*  to Republicans.
*  And so that's you know, it's not a guarantee then either.
*  I will say I think if it passes the House, the odds are very high that it gets through the
*  Senate one way or the other.
*  But you could have a lot of sound and fury before it does.
*  So if we assume that a deal emerges, gets announced and then needs to go through the
*  legislative process, it will be a rough and dramatic week ahead of us with absolutely
*  no guarantees other than drama.
*  Yeah, no guarantees other than drama is sort of like Washington's slogan right now.
*  But it's true. And I think in particular, you know, you'll have the backdrop of financial
*  markets because we don't know exactly when default would hit.
*  And I think that's the biggest wild card behind all of this is even if they make a deal, can
*  they get it done in time?
*  Because, well, Treasury thinks it's around June 1st that it will run out of money, which
*  is next Thursday, which is next Thursday.
*  But they can't say for sure.
*  And so there's all these questions about like, when would the drop dead date be?
*  And you could see a lot of late night votes.
*  You could see a lot of, you know, real consternation to pass this.
*  Right. What you're getting is that even if Congress clears these hurdles, which it
*  sounds like they might, the complexity of the process, the delays built into it, that
*  carries its own risks.
*  I think we should talk about what the fallout would look like if these deadlines get
*  missed. If Thursday comes and goes and the U.S.
*  hits the debt ceiling and technically defaults.
*  Just give us a really brief picture of what that starts to look like on day one.
*  So there's truly a couple of things that could happen.
*  One is that we could hit that default date, but it looks like a bill is about to get
*  passed and sent to the president.
*  And so nobody freaks out that much.
*  Maybe there's a little bit of a reaction in the bond market and stock market.
*  But really what it is, is that, you know, everybody thinks it's going to happen and
*  so they don't freak out.
*  They kind of give us permission to miss the date.
*  Yeah. But like, it's like, OK, I know you didn't make it to class just before the
*  tardy bell, but I saw you running across the field and so I'm going to count it.
*  Right. Whereas there's also a possibility that everybody freaks out if it doesn't
*  necessarily look like it's about to be signed, sealed and delivered.
*  There's just a meltdown in financial markets.
*  Stocks plunge, bond yields spike.
*  You know, it's the first days of a global financial crisis.
*  It would be brutal. And that could happen right away.
*  Now, obviously, the damage would be much worse if the default continues for weeks or
*  months. But even just a couple of days of a default could be really damaging.
*  And we don't know which of those scenarios it would be.
*  It's kind of like you have a third beer and you decide to get into the car and drive
*  home. Like maybe possibly you get there safely.
*  But it's a terrible idea and really dangerous.
*  And no safety minded person would advise you to do that.
*  And so I think that's sort of where we would be if Congress makes it past this
*  default date without having sent a bill to the president that he can sign right
*  away. Right.
*  Three beers in a fourth on the way.
*  Just not a good idea. Exactly.
*  Call someone else to drive you home at that point.
*  Let's be very clear. This podcast supports designated drivers.
*  Right. Designated drivers and fiscally responsible approaches to the debt ceiling,
*  which it looks like both sides are currently on a path toward achieving.
*  Right. I mean, if we're just being really honest with what your reporting tells us,
*  there is a good faith effort underway here to avoid the things that you have just
*  described. Yeah.
*  A lot could go wrong still.
*  When you leave anything to the last minute like this, something can go wrong.
*  But certainly the tenor over the last couple of days has really pointed toward
*  both sides are trying to get something done in time to avoid the worst
*  consequences. And, you know, that is has left everyone, I think, around these
*  stocks more optimistic that they will avoid the bad consequences than maybe they
*  were a week ago.
*  Well, Jim, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  On Thursday, after the latest round of negotiations with President Biden,
*  Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that a potential deal was close at
*  hand. But speaking to reporters, McCarthy emphasized that the deal would likely
*  leave some members of both parties unsatisfied, saying, quote, I don't think
*  everybody is going to be happy at the end of the day, adding that's not how
*  this system works.
*  We'll be right back. Here's what else you need to another day.
*  On Thursday, a judge sentenced the leader of the Oath Keepers Militia, Stuart
*  Rhodes, to 18 years in prison for his role in the January 6th riot at the U.S.
*  Capitol, the most severe penalty so far to stem from the assault.
*  The sentence was the result of Rhodes' conviction late last year on charges of
*  seditious conspiracy for plotting to keep former President Trump in power after
*  the 2020 election.
*  Rhodes has expressed no remorse for that plot and at his sentencing, called
*  himself, quote, a political prisoner.
*  And in the latest evidence that corporations are worried about artificial
*  intelligence, Microsoft has proposed a series of government regulations to
*  limit potential risks from the technology.
*  Those regulations include a requirement that AI can be turned off when used
*  in critical infrastructure and for creating a system of labels to make clear
*  when either an image or video is generated by AI.
*  The proposals are notable because Microsoft is building AI into many of its
*  products, including its search engine known as Bing.
