*  My name is Alex W. Palmer. I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times magazine.
*  This week's Sunday read is an article I wrote for the magazine about advanced semiconductor
*  chips and about how American export controls over these chips are reshaping US China relations
*  in ways we really haven't seen between two superpowers since the end of the Cold War.
*  October 7th, 2022 was a Friday and unbeknownst to most, it was a historic turning point.
*  On that day, the US officially announced export controls to prevent China from getting
*  a hold of the most advanced semiconductor chips.
*  This order came in the form of an SOTERIC 139-page document out of a tiny office within
*  the US Department of Commerce called the Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS for short.
*  The reason for these controls, according to BIS, was to put a stop to China's military
*  modernization and human rights abuses.
*  BIS is so small that its budget amounts to what is basically a rounding error for the Pentagon,
*  about one-eighth the cost of a single patriot missile battery.
*  And so it's remarkable that this office is responsible for overseeing theoretically every
*  economic interaction involving the US economy here or abroad, and that it essentially
*  established a non-proliferation regime for chips.
*  So nearly every electronic device runs on some kind of chip.
*  And to put it simply, a chip is just a piece of silicon with transistors on it.
*  The main chip on your iPhone could have 20 billion transistors, and they're each the
*  size of a virus.
*  But these aren't the chips that the US is so concerned about China obtaining.
*  Instead, it's the cutting-edge chips that are used to run supercomputers, power artificial
*  intelligence, and most importantly, help develop smart weapons that might be deployed on a
*  future battlefield.
*  There are just a handful of countries involved in producing the most advanced chips, and
*  the US is really the linchpin.
*  Every advanced chip in the world is made to some degree with American knowledge and American
*  technology.
*  And so the goal of the October 7th controls was not just to stop China's technological
*  development, but to reverse it, to pull the rug out from under them.
*  By declaring advanced chips a matter of national security, the Biden administration caught
*  off the entire supply chain for China.
*  The components that go into the manufacturing equipment that make up the factory and
*  that eventually create the chips that go into the missiles.
*  It takes decades of research to master all of these dozens or hundreds of steps in the
*  supply chain.
*  And now China is trying to play catch-up.
*  They're investing tens of billions of dollars.
*  In a way, it's become a technological Cold War.
*  They'll try to catch up.
*  And if it does, what will the world look like then?
*  So here's my article, an act of war inside America's Silicon blockade against China,
*  read by Robert Petkov.
*  Last October, the United States Bureau of Industry and Security issued a document that,
*  under this 139 pages of dense bureaucratic jargon and minute technical detail, amounted
*  to a declaration of economic war on China.
*  The magnitude of the act was made all the more remarkable by the relative obscurity of
*  its source.
*  One of 13 bureaus within the Department of Commerce, the smallest federal department
*  by funding, BIS, is tiny.
*  This budget for 2022 was just over $140 million, about one-eighth the cost of a single
*  Patriot Air Defense missile battery.
*  The bureau employs approximately 350 agents and officers who collectively monitor trillions
*  of dollars worth of transactions taking place all around the world.
*  During the height of the Cold War, when export controls to the Soviet block were at their
*  strictest, BIS was a critical hub in the Western defenses, processing up to 100,000 export
*  licenses annually.
*  During the relative peace and stability of the 1990s, the bureau lost some of its raison
*  d'être, as well as staff and funding, and licenses shriveled to roughly 10,000 per year.
*  To date, the number is 40,000 and climbing.
*  With a sprawling trade blacklist known as the Entity List, currently 662 pages in counting,
*  numerous pre-existing multilateral export control agreements and ongoing actions against Russia
*  and China, BIS is busier than ever.
*  We spend 100% of our time on Russia sanctions, another 100% on China, and the other 100%
*  on everything else, says Matt Bourman, the deputy assistant secretary of commerce for
*  export administration.
*  In recent years, semiconductor chips have become central to the bureau's work.
*  Chips are the lifeblood of the modern economy and the brains of every electronic device and
*  system, from iPhones to toasters, data centers to credit cards.
*  A new car might have more than 1,000 chips, each one managing a different facet of the
*  vehicle's operation.
*  MEConductors are also the driving force behind the innovations poised to revolutionize life
*  over the next century, like quantum computing and artificial intelligence.
*  Open AI's chat GPT, for example, was reportedly trained on 10,000 of the most advanced chips
*  currently available.
*  With the October 7 export controls, the United States government announced its intent
*  to cripple China's ability to produce or even purchase the highest end chips.
*  The logic of the measure was straightforward.
*  Advanced chips and the supercomputers and AI systems they power enabled the production
*  of new weapons and surveillance apparatuses.
*  In their reach and meaning, however, the measures could hardly have been more sweeping,
*  taking aim at a target far broader than the Chinese security state.
*  The key here is to understand that the US wanted to impact China's AI industry, says
*  Gregory C. Allen, director of the Wadwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies at the Center
*  for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
*  The semiconductor stuff is the means to that end.
*  Though delivered in the unassuming form of updated export rules, the October 7 control
*  essentially seek to eradicate root and branch China's entire ecosystem of advanced technology.
*  The new policy embodied in October 7 is not only are we not going to allow China to
*  progress any further technologically, we are going to actively reverse their current state
*  of the art, Alan says.
*  CJ Muse, a senior semiconductor analyst at Evercore ISI, put it this way.
*  If you'd told me about these rules five years ago, I would have told you that's an act
*  of war, we'd have to be at war.
*  If the controls are successful, they could handicap China for a generation.
*  If they fail, they may backfire spectacularly, hastening the very future the United States
*  is trying desperately to avoid.
*  The outcome will likely shape US China competition and the future of the global order for decades
*  to come.
*  There are two dates that will echo in history from 2022.
*  Alan says, the first is February 24th when Russia invaded Ukraine and the second is October
*  7th.
*  Despite the immense intricacy of their design, semiconductors are, in a sense, quite simple.
*  Tiny pieces of silicon carved with arrays of circuits.
*  The circuits flip on and off based on the activity of switches called transistors.
*  When a circuit is on, it produces a one, off a zero.
*  The first chips invented in the late 1950s held only a handful of transistors.
*  Today, the primary semiconductor in a new smartphone has between 10 and 20 billion transistors,
*  each about the size of a virus carved like a layer cake into the structure of the silicon.
*  The rate of progress over the last six decades has been famously described by Moore's Law,
*  which observed that the number of transistors that can be fit on a chip has roughly doubled
*  every two years.
*  Chris Miller, author of the book, Chip War, and an associate professor of international
*  history at the Fletcher School at Tufts University likes to note that if airplanes had improved
*  at the same rate as chips, they'd now be flying at several times the speed of light.
*  No technology in the history of human civilization has ever matched the breath taking a scent of
*  computing power.
*  Semiconductor manufacturing plants, known as fabs, are the most expensive factories in the
*  world, conducting the most complex manufacturing ever accomplished at a scale of production
*  never before achieved with any other device.
*  The wider chip industry meanwhile is a web of mutual interdependence spread all over
*  the planet in highly specialized regions and companies.
*  Its feats made possible by supply chains of exceptional length and complexity, of poster
*  child in other words for globalization.
*  It's hard to imagine how the capabilities they've reached would be possible without
*  access to the smartest minds in the world all working together.
*  Miller says, and yet it is this same interconnectedness that makes the industry vulnerable to regulations
*  like those the Biden administration is pursuing.
*  Only a small handful of companies can compete at the cutting edge where breakthroughs cost
*  billions of dollars and decades of research.
*  The result is an industry structured as a series of choke points.
*  The best known example is the extreme ultraviolet EUV lithography machine made by ASML, a Dutch
*  manufacturing conglomerate which is used to print out the layers of a chip.
*  In 1997, ASML hired Joe Sbenzschop, a young engineer with a PhD in physics to spearhead
*  the creation of a new system, one that would help ASML's customers in the semiconductor industry
*  print smaller, faster, and denser chips than ever before.
*  It took four years to achieve the proof of concept necessary to even justify assigning
*  a small team to the task and then another five years for the team to build a prototype
*  machine.
*  In December 2010 at a research facility in South Korea, an updated prototype, a twin scan
*  NXE 3100, finally had its first successful test run.
*  It would be nearly another decade before the first EUV-enabled products would go to market.
*  The newest version of the machine can craft structures as small as ten nanometers, a human
*  red blood cell by comparison is about 7,000 nanometers across.
*  It uses a laser to create plasma 40 times hotter than the surface of the sun, which emits
*  extreme ultraviolet light invisible to the human eye, that is refracted onto a silicon chip
*  by a series of mirrors.
*  The laser is sourced from a German company and has 457,329 pieces.
*  An entire EUV has more than 100,000 components of similar intricacy.
*  An EUV is just one part of the process.
*  A cutting edge fab can include more than 500 machines and 1,000 steps.
*  And yet an EUV alone is a nearly miraculous human achievement capable of working at scales
*  and precision that are difficult to fathom.
*  I truly believe our machine is the most complex thing mankind has ever produced, says Ben's
*  shop, now ASMR's corporate vice president of technology.
*  Today, more than a decade since the Twin Scans first test run, no other company has been
*  able to recreate ASMR's achievement.
*  By squeezing on the industry's natural choke points, the Biden administration aims to
*  block China from the future of chip technology.
*  The effects will go far beyond cutting into Chinese military advancements, threatening
*  the country's economic growth and scientific leadership too.
*  We said there are key tech areas that China should not advance in, says Emily Kilkreis,
*  a senior fellow at the center for a new American security and a former US trade official.
*  And those happen to be the areas that will power future economic growth and development.
*  Today, scientific advances are often made by running simulations and analyzing huge amounts
*  of data rather than through trial and error experiments.
*  Dengarra is used to discover new life-saving drugs, to model the future of climate change,
*  and to explore the behavior of colliding galaxies, as well as the physics of hypersonic missiles
*  and nuclear explosions.
*  The person with the best supercomputer can do the best science.
*  Jack Dengarra, founding director of the Innovative Computing Laboratory at the University of Tennessee,
*  told me,
*  Dengarra runs a program called the Top 500, which offers a biannual ranking of the fastest
*  supercomputers in the world.
*  As of June, China claims 134 spots, compared with 150 for the US.
*  But the picture is incomplete.
*  Around 2020, China's submissions plummeted in a way that suggested to Dengarra a desire
*  to avoid attracting unwanted attention.
*  Rumors of new supercomputers leak out in scientific papers and research announcements, leaving
*  observers to guess at the true state of the competition, and the size of China's presumed
*  lead.
*  It's striking because in 2001, China had no computers on the list.
*  Dengarra says,
*  Now they've grown to the point that they dominate it.
*  Yet beneath China's strength is a crucial vulnerability.
*  Nearly all the chips that power the country's most advanced projects and institutions are
*  inexorably tied to US technology.
*  The entire industry can only function with US inputs.
*  Miller says,
*  In every facility that's remotely close to the cutting edge, there's US tools, US design
*  software, and US intellectual property throughout the process.
*  Despite decades of effort by the Chinese government and tens of billions of dollars spent on indigenous
*  innovation, the problem remains acute.
*  In 2020, China's domestic chip producers supplied just 15.9% of the country's overall demand.
*  As recently as April, China spent more money importing semiconductors than it did oil.
*  America fully grasped its power over the global semiconductor market in 2019, when the Trump
*  administration added Huawei, a major Chinese telecommunications maker to the entity list.
*  So the listing was ostensibly punishment for a criminal violation.
*  Huawei had been caught selling sanctioned materials to Iran.
*  The strategic benefits became immediately obvious.
*  Without access to US semiconductors, software, and other essential supplies, Huawei, the
*  largest telecommunications equipment producer in the world, was left struggling to survive.
*  The Huawei sanctions immediately pulled back the curtain, says Matt Sheen, a fellow at
*  the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies China's tech ecosystem.
*  Chinese tech giants are running on chips that are made in America or have deep American
*  components.
*  Export control law had long been seen as a dusty, arcane backwater, far removed from the
*  actual exercise of American power.
*  But after Huawei, the United States discovered that its primacy in the semiconductor supply
*  chain was a rich source of untapped leverage.
*  Many firms, all located in the US, dominate the market for chip design software, which
*  is used to arrange the billions of transistors that fit on a new chip.
*  The market for advanced chip manufacturing tools is similarly concentrated, with a handful
*  of companies able to claim effective monopolies over essential machines or processes, and
*  nearly all of these companies are American or dependent on American components.
*  At every step, the supply chain runs through the US, US treaty allies or Taiwan, all of
*  them operating in a US-dominated ecosystem.
*  We stumbled into it, she and says.
*  We started using these weapons before we really knew how to use them.
*  In May 2020, the Trump administration tightened the screws further, this time by making Huawei
*  subject to a formally obscure provision of export control law called the Foreign Direct
*  Product Rule.
*  Under the FDPR, foreign-made items are subject to American controls if they were produced
*  using American technology or software.
*  It is a sweeping assertion of extraterritorial power.
*  Even if an item is made and shipped outside the United States, never once crossing the
*  country's borders and contains no US origin components or technology in the final product,
*  it can still be considered an American good.
*  For Huawei, the application of the FDPR meant the company was virtually cut off from semiconductors.
*  That rule subjected all semiconductors on the planet to American law because every
*  foundry on the planet uses US tools at least in part.
*  Kevin Wolf, a former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration at the
*  BIS, says,
*  If you have one US tool and 100 non-American tools in your fab, that taints any wafer moving
*  across the line.
*  In 2020, according to the market analysis from Candlest, Huawei was the largest smartphone
*  seller in the world, with an 18% market share, besting even Apple and Samsung.
*  Huawei's revenues plunged by nearly a third in 2021 and the company sold off one of its
*  smartphone brands in a bid to stay afloat.
*  By 2022, its share had fallen to 2%.
*  The October 7th rules represented the sum of everything US policymakers had learned about
*  semiconductors, supply chains, and American power.
*  The measures were announced as an interim final rule, meaning they took effect immediately,
*  a direct reaction to a perceived weakness in the Huawei controls.
*  There was a lot of notice before the Huawei rule came into effect and they spent the time
*  beforehand stockpiling, says Peter Harrell, a former senior director for International
*  Economics at the National Security Council who was involved in crafting the October 7th
*  rules.
*  That was a tactical lesson that you need the element of surprise.
*  More important, the United States had learned that hobbling one company, however large,
*  simply created room for new competitors to step in.
*  A more comprehensive approach would be needed.
*  The Trump administration went after companies, says Alan, the CSIS expert, the Biden administration
*  is going after industries.
*  The rules went deeper into the semiconductor supply chain than any previous measure.
*  China was cut off not just from importing the most advanced chips, but also from acquiring
*  the inputs to develop its own advanced semiconductors and supercomputers, and even from the US
*  origin components, technology and software that could be used to produce semiconductor
*  manufacturing equipment to eventually build their own fabs to make their own chips.
*  It was an all-of-the-above strategy.
*  Wolf, the former BIS official, says, some elements were entirely novel, like a restriction
*  on the activity of any US persons, companies and citizens as well as green card holders
*  and permanent residents.
*  After October 7th, US persons are no longer allowed to engage in any activity that supports
*  the production of advanced semiconductors in China, whether by maintaining or repairing
*  equipment in a Chinese fab, offering advice, or even authorizing deliveries to a Chinese
*  semiconductor manufacturer.
*  The decision to act unilaterally was a diplomatic gamble.
*  Though the United States controls a number of key choke points in the global supply chain,
*  other countries, particularly Taiwan, Japan and the Netherlands, hold dominance over similarly
*  crucial sectors of the manufacturing process.
*  Had those countries continued to sell to China as before, it would have rendered the October
*  7th controls nearly useless.
*  But in late January, the Biden administration reached an agreement with Japan and the Netherlands,
*  under which they would implement similar controls on semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing
*  equipment.
*  Taiwan had already signed on months earlier as soon as the controls were announced.
*  The island is a chip manufacturing juggernaut.
*  It produces almost two-thirds of the world's semiconductors annually and over 90% of the
*  most advanced ones.
*  Much of that output is thanks to a single firm, TSMC, the most valuable public company in
*  all of Asia and the most advanced semiconductor manufacturer in the world.
*  By itself, TSMC accounts for about a third of the total global market for contract chip
*  fabrication.
*  OPEC, by comparison, controls about 40% of the global oil market.
*  Taiwan's central role in global chip production makes it indispensable to the United States.
*  If the island's fabs were to be captured by China or knocked offline during an invasion,
*  the costs to the global economy would be catastrophic.
*  Taiwan's chips strangle hold is sometimes called its silicon shield, the island's most
*  formidable deterrent against a Chinese attack, and its best assurance of American help in
*  the event of a Chinese invasion.
*  But the partnership between the US and Taiwan is an unequal one.
*  Though Taiwan is unmatched in chip manufacturing, it captures less than 10% of the global market
*  by revenue.
*  The bulk of sales, 40% in 2022, go to the American firms that export their chip manufacturing
*  to Taiwan in much the same way that American closed designers profit from the sale of items
*  that are actually sewn overseas.
*  Strategically, American policymakers see the US's dependence on Taiwan as an unacceptable
*  risk.
*  They have pushed for TSMC to build more fabs in the US as part of a broader strategy to
*  locate more semiconductor manufacturing closer to American shores.
*  Taiwan has no choice but to comply for fear of upsetting its most powerful ally and
*  largest arms supplier.
*  But with every move to erode the island's preeminence, it makes itself more vulnerable.
*  In the worst case, Taiwan's chip chokehold may only invite more destruction.
*  Some American commentators and war gamers have suggested that if China does invade, the
*  US should destroy TSMC's fabs to stop them from falling under China's control.
*  One problem with trying to control the global flow of semiconductors is that they're
*  very small, lightweight, and valuable.
*  China's love stuff like that, Alan says, but China needs chips in large quantities to
*  power massive data centers and facilities housing cutting edge computers, and that makes
*  their procurement uniquely challenging.
*  Those are large buildings and they don't move, Miller says.
*  It's uniquely suited to be understood by US intelligence.
*  The structure of the market will also present a hurdle to anyone trying to circumvent the
*  regulations.
*  The number of companies capable of producing cutting edge chips is extremely limited, and
*  the number of buyers with a history of purchasing from them is also small.
*  But there are also loopholes in the enforcement system which Chinese companies are already
*  probing.
*  In March, INSPIRR group, a Chinese conglomerate, active in cloud computing and server manufacturing,
*  was added to the entity list.
*  According to the Wall Street Journal, at least one of the company's affiliates was not
*  included in the listing, allowing American businesses to sell to the subsidiary unimpeded.
*  Chips are moving through China by more circuitous routes as well.
*  Last month, Reuters reported on a booming underground trade in high-end chips in Shenzhen,
*  with multiple retailers touting their ability to supply the A100, a powerful chip made
*  by the American company Envidia.
*  The US government's ability to detect and prevent these types of hand-to-hand sales is limited.
*  BIS has only three enforcement agents stationed in China, but the existence of the underground
*  market was, in fact, an early signal of the control's efficacy.
*  According to retailers interviewed by Reuters, the chips were available only in small batches,
*  perhaps from stocks shipped to China before the ban took effect.
*  It highlights that the controls are working, an industry executive who requested anonymity
*  in order to candidly assess American policy told me.
*  They wouldn't be doing that if chips flowed freely.
*  The battle over the controls may serve as a kind of civilizational test.
*  In the West, the Onus of Compliance will fall largely on private companies.
*  The O.B. is our primary line of defense, says Thea Rosman-Kendler, the Assistant Secretary
*  of Export Administration at BIS.
*  We can do whatever we can in government to promulgate clear and concise and effective rules,
*  but it's industry that's responsible for compliance and putting those rules into effect.
*  For the controls to succeed, American industry will need to engage in actions that are,
*  at least in the short term, self-sabotaging, shutting off a piece of the lucrative Chinese
*  market.
*  Companies will have ample reason to operate as close to the edge of legality as possible,
*  and their Chinese counterparts will have every incentive to gain the system and feed them
*  the information needed to approve a sale.
*  For China, the race for technological self-sufficiency presents perhaps a greater challenge than
*  any the country has faced.
*  The very traits that make China's success possible, iron political will, endless money
*  and a whole of society mobilization around key goals, are just as likely to prove it's
*  a killi's heel.
*  In the last several years, as the push to develop a domestic semiconductor industry has
*  taken on new urgency, at least six multi-billion dollar chip projects have failed, and a number
*  of executives have been put under investigation for corruption.
*  Tens of thousands of companies, meanwhile, have flooded into the semiconductor industry,
*  some of them with little or no expertise in chips solely in search of easy government
*  money.
*  It's easy for political leaders or executives to think if we throw enough money and
*  engineers at this problem, we'll solve it.
*  Jason Mathini, former deputy director of the White House Office of Science and Technology
*  Policy says, but the immense complexity of the science and the globe-spanning supply chains
*  are difficult to imitate.
*  At some point, says Mathini, you're replicating all of human civilization.
*  Yet, if any country can overcome such a challenge, it is likely to be China.
*  The October 7th export controls, while crippling China's advanced chip-making ability for
*  the foreseeable future may end up spurring long-term growth.
*  When Chinese companies had access to superior Western chips and suppliers, domestic manufacturers
*  struggled to find business.
*  Now Chinese companies must innovate together or die.
*  We've removed choice, Kilkreeze says, before they could choose between national resiliency
*  and commercial motivations, and now they don't have that choice.
*  Should a large share of China's $400 billion in annual chip imports be turned inward,
*  domestic chip companies may finally have the means and motivation to catch up.
*  Huawei may prove instructive once again.
*  battered by American sanctions and China's strict pandemic controls, the company's 2022
*  profits fell by a staggering 70% compared with the previous year.
*  But there are signs of life.
*  Despite the plunge and profits, revenues rose slightly, and the company's operating system,
*  Harmony OS, which it developed after being cut off from using Android, has been installed
*  on more than 330 million devices, mostly in China.
*  Huawei remains one of the world's biggest spenders on research and development, with a
*  budget of about $24 billion last year and a research team of over 100,000 employees.
*  The emphasis on innovation is by necessity.
*  Bereft of American chips and technology, Huawei has been forced to redesign and remanufacture
*  all of its legacy products to ensure they contain no American components.
*  The company is dragging along an entire domestic supply chain in its wake, sending its own engineers
*  to help train and upscale Chinese suppliers it once shunned in favor of foreign alternatives.
*  Recently, Huawei claimed that it had made significant breakthroughs in the electronic design
*  software used to produce advanced semiconductors at a size that, though still a few generations
*  behind the US, would put it further along than any other Chinese company.
*  If Huawei manages to succeed, it could emerge from American sanctions stronger and more resilient
*  than ever.
*  The controls will not stop China permanently.
*  Even in the best case, they're a delay tactic meant to offer the US and its allies space
*  to expand their lead in key technologies.
*  The question is, how much time BIS can buy for the West?
*  This isn't the type of business where success is batting 1,000, said Matt Axelrod, the
*  Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement.
*  Our goal is to stop as much as possible.
*  I was meeting with Axelrod and Rosman Kendler, the Export Administration Chief at the
*  Commerce Department building in an office overlooking the ellipse in downtown Washington,
*  DC.
*  It had taken just a few minutes to walk nearly the entire length of BIS headquarters.
*  Even allowing that enforcement need not be perfect, I wondered whether this was a fair
*  fight, the Bureau of Industry and Security versus the full weight of the Chinese government.
*  How could BIS win?
*  How could it hope to move as quickly?
*  How could BIS possibly put as much money behind the effort and care as much about chips
*  as China does?
*  The future of chips was life or death for China.
*  There were a few seconds of silence before Rosman Kendler answered in a quiet voice.
*  It's probably life or death for us, too, she said.
