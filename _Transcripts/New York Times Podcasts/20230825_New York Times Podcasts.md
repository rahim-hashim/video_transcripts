*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Teverny-C, and this is The Daily.
*  Today, a mysterious crash of a private jet outside Moscow is believed to have killed
*  Yves Gengi Prigorshin, the Wagner-Molisha boss who led an armed rebellion against Moscow
*  earlier this summer.
*  My colleague Anton Trinovsky tells me what we've learned about the crash and what a potential
*  political assassination would say about Putin's Russia.
*  It's Friday, August 25.
*  So Anton, it's Thursday night for you.
*  You've been following what's been happening in Russia over the past 24 hours.
*  So to catch people up, Yves Gengi Prigorshin, a guy we've talked a lot about on the show,
*  is presumed dead in a plane crash just outside Moscow.
*  There's still lots of questions swirling around this.
*  But before we talk about what actually happened, I want to go back to the last time we talked
*  about Prigorshin on the show.
*  You know, that was when he struck a deal after this armed rebellion that he had staged,
*  that it essentially guaranteed his kind of immunity, if you will.
*  So tell us the story of what happened to Prigorshin since then.
*  So two months ago, Yves Gengi Prigorshin mounted a mutiny against the Russian military leadership.
*  That was really the biggest threat to Putin's rule in the last 23 years.
*  Ever since Putin took power.
*  And on June 24th, as that mutiny was happening, Putin went out and called Prigorshin a traitor.
*  So at that point, it really felt like Prigorshin's days were numbered because we know that Putin
*  does not tolerate traders.
*  But as you said, Prigorshin strikes some kind of deal with the Kremlin that allows Wagner
*  fighters to find refuge in Belarus.
*  Prigorshin himself also goes to Belarus.
*  So it really feels like Prigorshin has somehow managed to save his skin at least for the moment.
*  Then we see more and more striking evidence that despite having led this mutiny,
*  Prigorshin seems to have gotten out of this somehow.
*  On June 29th, Prigorshin actually meets in person with Putin at the Kremlin,
*  along with other commanders of his Wagner mercenary force.
*  Which just seemed extraordinarily odd at the time, right?
*  Like, here was this guy who just marched on Moscow and Putin is giving him a private audience.
*  I mean, it was very confusing.
*  But then I kind of lost the thread after that Anton.
*  What happened next?
*  So next, it seems like Prigorshin was able to continue establishing his presence in Africa.
*  Remember, Africa is really a key continent for Prigorshin's activities.
*  That's where the Wagner mercenary force is active,
*  propping up authoritarian leaders in countries like the Central African Republic and Mali,
*  who are loyal to Moscow.
*  It's a region where Prigorshin has extensive business interests in gold and diamond mining,
*  among other things.
*  And in late July, Putin hosts African leaders at a summit in St. Petersburg,
*  and Prigorshin puts out photographs of him meeting with African officials on the sidelines of that summit.
*  So we see that even in really one of Putin's marquee diplomatic events of the year,
*  Prigorshin is still involved.
*  Okay, so months after this mutiny, it seems like no consequences for Prigorshin, right?
*  Like, he's still very much in the mix.
*  Absolutely. And it even seemed like he may be returning to his old role as that kind of
*  Swiss army knife in Putin's toolkit.
*  And all that was reinforced this past Monday when Prigorshin put out a video of himself
*  that he posted online.
*  In which he suggests that he is back in Africa.
*  He's in a kind of arid landscape.
*  He says it's really hot.
*  He's wearing military fatigues and holding an assault rifle.
*  And he says that Wagner is still operating, that Wagner is recruiting,
*  and that it's carrying out the tasks that were assigned to it.
*  So all that put together, it really felt like Prigorshin had essentially survived that rebellion.
*  And then came the plane crash on Wednesday.
*  So let's talk through that. I was glued to my phone all night.
*  You were going crazy with the news.
*  Tell me what happened. Start from the beginning.
*  So Wednesday evening, Moscow time, the Russian Civil Aviation Authority puts out a statement
*  announcing that a private plane had crashed north of Moscow that all 10 people aboard had been killed.
*  And that the passenger manifest included the name of Yvgeny Prigorshin.
*  Shortly thereafter, we saw footage circulating online of a plane falling out of the sky, spiraling down.
*  We saw footage of burning airplane wreckage on the ground.
*  And then we started trying to piece together what happened to that plane.
*  This was an Embraer jet that was flying from Moscow's Cherometivo Airport to St. Petersburg.
*  And flight tracking data showed that it reached a cruising altitude of 28,000 feet and flew on at
*  that point for nine minutes showing no signs of any problems.
*  And then suddenly according to the data, the airplane started making these erratic
*  ascents and descents of several hundred feet for about 12 seconds.
*  And then suddenly dropped 8,000 feet in about 20 seconds.
*  And then it crashed in the Tver region, northwest of Moscow.
*  So it just falls out of the sky in a span of seconds.
*  Yeah, that's right. You see it spiraling down in that video and that's what the flight
*  tracking data shows too, that it wasn't some kind of extended mechanical issue
*  that the pilots were struggling to deal with. It was some kind of sudden catastrophic event.
*  Several hours later, pretty late Wednesday night, the Russian Civil Aviation Authority put out
*  another statement that showed the full list of the seven passengers and three crew members that were
*  recorded as having been on that plane. And it not only included the name of Yvgeny Prigogin,
*  but it also had the name of Dmitry Utkin, who was essentially Prigogin's number two in the Wagner
*  Mercenary Group, the main commander, really a critical figure in that force.
*  So it did feel like something extremely dramatic may have just happened.
*  That Prigogin, who really has been one of the most defining figures of the Putin era,
*  especially of the last few years, may have actually been assassinated.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Anton, you said this was really starting to look like an assassination.
*  Walk me through why you think that. What do you see?
*  Well, for starters, we have that flight tracking data that shows that the plane was
*  proceeding normally until some sudden event caused it first to go up and down really quickly
*  and then to plummet out of the sky, almost like a stone. That certainly indicates that
*  something happened suddenly on that plane, causing it to crash.
*  And then on Thursday, our colleagues in Washington reported that Western officials believe
*  that an explosion on the plane is what brought it down. That's based on preliminary intelligence
*  reports. Those officials say, and there's no definitive conclusion that's been reached,
*  but Western officials certainly also believe that foul play was behind this crash.
*  Okay, so explosion on board very likely, which is to use a phrase, a smoking gun of intention,
*  right? Intentional act. But I guess the next question is, who did it? Is the assumption that
*  it's Russia itself? Well, Sabrina, we don't know who did it. But I have to say that the first
*  thing I thought of when I saw the news of the crash and that Prigogin may have been on that plane
*  was that speech that I mentioned that Putin gave as the rebellion was going on on June 24th,
*  when he called Prigogin a traitor. And that choice of words by Putin was really important,
*  because he's been public about it. He has said that it's one thing to have an enemy. You can
*  deal with your enemies, but traders betrayal is something that he does not forgive. A traitor is
*  the worst thing possible in Putin's mind. Exactly. And so I've been closely watching, of course,
*  what Putin has been up to himself over the last 24 hours. And it's been quite notable, you know,
*  plane crashes like this are really rare even in Russia. Totally. And yet he said nothing about
*  this crash, even though if a plane goes down like that, you would expect the president to say
*  something about that, but he didn't. What did that silence tell you Anton? Well, I think it's so
*  some doubt as to whether Putin was really grieving this event, you know, there was no statement of
*  condolence is published on the Kremlin website for nearly 24 hours after the crash. It was only
*  Thursday evening that Putin broke his silence.
*  I want to express my sincere condolences. And Putin said that he was offering his condolences to
*  the families of those on board. He said that it appeared according to the preliminary data
*  that there were Wagner members on that plane. He said that Wagner had played a very important role
*  in the war in Ukraine that quote, we will remember and won't forget. And then he started talking
*  about pregozion. He talked about him in the past tense, which frankly was the most direct
*  confirmation we received that pregozion had in fact been killed. Putin said that pregozion
*  was a man who was very talented and a talented businessman, but also someone who had made
*  very serious mistakes in life. And Putin finally also said that there will be an investigation and
*  that it will be carried out to the finish and that we will find out, you know, at some point
*  what happened. So what was notable about that was that Putin did not blame this on Ukrainian
*  terrorists or on the West in the way that he does with so many other incidents in Russia.
*  You know, you also didn't really get the feeling that he was trying to push responsibility here
*  onto someone else. But the other thing worth noting is that Wednesday, just hours before the
*  plane crash, another important piece of news emerged, which was that Russian state media confirmed
*  that General Sergei Suravikin had been relieved of his duties as the commander of Russia's
*  Air Force. And the reason that's important is that Suravikin was seen as the most important
*  ally of pregozion in the Russian military. He for several months actually was the main commander
*  of Russian forces in Ukraine. And so you do get the feeling that the Kremlin may be clearing house
*  in some way that, you know, it's removing two very influential figures who also caused problems
*  for the military command and for Putin. Well, Anton, let's kind of sit with the possibility for
*  a minute here that Putin did in fact have something to do with pregozion's presumed death.
*  So if things had gone back to normal and, you know, pregozion was doing his Africa stuff buzzing
*  around in his private jet, it seemed like Putin still had a use for pregozion, right?
*  Like, I guess my question is why kill him? So fear is a very important element of Putin's grip on
*  power. And I just spoke to someone who's a newspaper editor in Moscow who told me like everyone
*  is afraid. No one knows what, especially in the elite in Moscow. People don't really understand
*  what happened, but it's scary when a private jet falls out of the sky. And that fear is
*  advantageous for Putin, especially right now when there is so much stress on the economy and on
*  the country as a result of the invasion. There is obviously a lot of discontent. So really one of
*  the most important things that Putin can do to maintain his grip on power is to show the elites
*  around him who might perhaps try to do something to change the situation in Russia, that if they try
*  that, the consequences will be severe. So it could have been really about signaling to the
*  Russian elite, which is of course this very important piece of the puzzle of how the Russian
*  system functions, right? Of how it it perpetuates and keeps going. Yeah, and also remember that Putin
*  looked a bit weak in the aftermath of the rebellion. It was pretty confusing to a lot of people,
*  including people, bloggers affiliated with the military and supporters of the war. They were
*  stunned by the fact that pregozion's forces shot down Russian military aircraft during that rebellion,
*  killing Russian military service members, and no one being punished as a result. Right. And I
*  think there's very much going to be a school of thought coming out of Wednesday's plane crash
*  that it was an operation designed by the Kremlin to restore Putin's image of dominance and strength.
*  But Anton, to that point, what about the timing? I mean, if that was always the way it was going to
*  go, then why not just kill him immediately? Why wait two months and make it look like you're
*  rebuilding this partnership with him? That's a great question. I mean, there was certainly a fear
*  in the aftermath of the rebellion, I think, that if Putin had killed pregozion right afterward,
*  he would have turned him into a martyr and risked some kind of new rebellion. You could make the case
*  that by doing it two months later, Putin has allowed those tempers, those post-rebellion tempers to
*  come down. Right. And I think there's another factor which is the war in Ukraine. So I think if
*  you listen to Putin, you see that he's feeling more confident about how the Russian war effort is
*  going right now, then perhaps at any other point in the course of this war. And we hear from
*  Western officials and military analysts that in fact, Ukraine has really struggled in its counteroffensive.
*  So that gives Putin, I think, additional confidence to potentially take these drastic actions.
*  And you know, it's also quite ironic in a way that Putin actually has pregozion and general
*  Sura Vikin to thank for the Russian military's relatively strong position right now because it was
*  General Sura Vikin who was demoted on Wednesday, who oversaw the construction of these really daunting
*  defensive lines that Russia built across the territory that it controls in Ukraine. And then
*  pregozion with his Wagner force, he was the one who fought Ukrainian forces in that incredibly
*  bloody battle for the city of Bachmout. And Western and American officials believe that actually
*  the casualties that Ukraine took in Bachmout are now one reason why Ukraine has struggled in its
*  counteroffensive. Because it spent so many resources in Bachmout largely because of Sura Vikin
*  and pregozion. Exactly. So Sura Vikin and pregozion are now demoted and apparently dead respectively.
*  But they also played this incredibly important role in helping Putin stabilize his invasion and
*  improve Russia's position in the war. So, you know, clearly these two guys were incredibly
*  important to the war effort for a long time. But it sounds like what you're saying is that at this
*  point, you know, Putin thinks it's going pretty well and he doesn't need them anymore or the Wagner
*  group. So Anton, does this essentially spell the end of the Wagner group? That's one of the key
*  questions we'll be watching in the next few days and weeks. One element to think about too
*  is that the Wagner group and pregozion, they were really part of that ultra-nationalist, super-hawkish
*  wing of Russia that throughout the war was really quite critical of Putin. Right. They were to
*  the right of Putin, right? In many ways, exactly. Yeah, they were to the right of Putin. They were saying
*  pregozion was saying that Putin wasn't being harsh enough. He wasn't being tough enough. He wasn't
*  being aggressive enough. He wasn't doing enough to put the nation on a war footing and mobilize
*  society as part of this war. You know, as you know, pregozion once said that Putin should turn
*  into North Korea if he wanted to win this war. And so one of the things you've seen over the last
*  two months is that Putin has really cracked down on the right wing on the pro-war hawks who criticized
*  him for not being aggressive enough. Obviously, when the war began and really for most of Putin's tenure,
*  he was pretty focused on crushing the liberal opposition. People like Alexei Navalny, people who
*  want to turn Russia into a pro-Western democracy. By the beginning of this year, he had pretty much
*  crushed that part of the opposition completely. But as it turned out, there was also another type
*  of opposition to Putin, which we saw with pregozion's rebellion. And that was the people who were
*  critical of Putin from the right, the ultra-nationalists. And in the last two months, Putin has taken
*  steps to crack down on them. He has arrested a very popular right-wing blogger and former military
*  commander in Ukraine called Igor Gyrkin. You've seen the ultra-nationalist bloggers on telegram who
*  previously were very harsh on their criticism of the Russian military really toned down that criticism,
*  pretty clearly under pressure from the authorities. And what happened to pregozion may well have
*  been part of that too. So in a way, it doesn't actually matter that much, whether we know forensically
*  that Putin was behind this plane crash, right? Because it's the perception that matters. And the
*  perception is that he was. And that's the signal that's being sent here. I think that's absolutely
*  right. I mean, the perception, more specifically, is maybe that he could do this, you know? And that
*  this could happen absolutely to anyone who crosses Putin or seriously threatens his power. So
*  as a result, this is very much another step that brings Russia into an even more authoritarian
*  lockdown place where people in the elite certainly are going to be afraid to speak their mind,
*  are going to be scared of being seen as disloyal, will bend over backwards even more to try to show
*  their loyalty. And is that a model for a political system that's sustainable in the long term?
*  That is very much unclear.
*  Anton, thank you. Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Thursday night, a former president, Donald Trump
*  flew to Atlanta and turned himself in at the Fulton County Jail. He was booked on 13 state
*  felony charges for his efforts to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Mr. Trump spent
*  about 20 minutes at the jail submitting to some of the routines of criminal defendant intake.
*  He was fingerprinted and had his photo taken. Minutes after he entered the jail, Trump's record
*  appeared in Fulton County's booking system. It listed him as having blonde or strawberry hair,
*  a height of six feet three inches, and a weight of 215 pounds.
*  Officials said Trump should be booked like anyone else accused of a felony.
*  But the process was much faster than for most defendants. He was finished in about 20 minutes,
*  and on his way back to the airport where his private plane was waiting.
