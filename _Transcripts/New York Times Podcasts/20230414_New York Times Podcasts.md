# Broadwayâ€™s Longest-Running Musical Turns Out the Lights
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 14, 2023](https://rr1---sn-ab5sznzr.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1711158227&ei=c9_9ZYqYNuK6_9EPvOmDuA8&ip=128.59.177.129&id=o-AFnbzIaKZs-IbWO-D7_qRwSkDZ9XnMiD0m3nmKMUs_by&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=2b&mm=31%2C26&mn=sn-ab5sznzr%2Csn-p5qddn7z&ms=au%2Conr&mv=m&mvi=1&pl=16&initcwndbps=1273750&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=12469206&dur=2044.559&lmt=1681466147149609&mt=1711136214&fvip=3&keepalive=yes&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRgIhAPXTBY3tPmyiOF1xQ3i-5Ji8KpIsdeOX8MvJHwgt1An0AiEAqmcduYPozGj6qnN_-8IKgggF4P_9Py8F9qpTEarfvr8%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRAIgIgEs4lxNj_HpxGBC_uR3xgEVjrazoNJb8gLDA3MR1rcCIE1k-P2-DzaDQOhHea9jj3D5fUmf0xfWuMaVKMMRlUwL)
*  So we've just arrived at the majestic theater where the crew is getting the set ready for
*  this afternoon.
*  Matt and I, of course as soon as you walk into this unbelievably beautiful and completely
*  empty theater, the first thing you see is the chandelier which is hanging over the center
*  orchestra.
*  The chandelier of course is the icon of this show.
*  It famously sort of crashes over the audience at the end of the first act.
*  RC is good!
*  To do.
*  Mike checks as the sound crew is making sure that everything works.
*  They've checked the lights, they check the speakers.
*  That's all starting to happen.
*  Well, welcome in together.
*  Good afternoon and welcome to Phantom of the Opera.
*  The house is now open.
*  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
*  Step on down, take a dark one.
*  Can you help out your seats?
*  Thank you.
*  The lights are going down.
*  The crowd is super pumped for this.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Mike of Avarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  In Midtown Manhattan on Sunday, Phantom of the Opera, the longest running show in the
*  history of Broadway will close its doors after more than three decades.
*  Today, the story of the show's meteoric rise, stunning longevity and bitter sweet closing.
*  My colleagues, theatre reporter Michael Paulson and daily producers Sydney Harper and Eric
*  Crupkey take us backstage during one of Phantom's final performances.
*  It's Friday, April 14th.
*  It's funny, it's actually a lot louder back here than I expected.
*  Hi, I'm Greg.
*  This is Greg.
*  I'm a huge sweet girl.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  Of course.
*  You sing your name in your title to the table.
*  Sure.
*  My name is Greg Lovody and I'm the production stage manager.
*  How long have you been here?
*  About ten and a half years.
*  You guys must have all of this just like memorized.
*  Do you hear it in your sleep?
*  Yeah.
*  I joke a lot that I could do every line in the show, but I could only do it if I was saying
*  every single line.
*  Just straight down.
*  So where are we right now exactly?
*  So we're in the trap room under the stage.
*  So all these trap doors are about to open up as we go into the Phantom's Lair.
*  And how big is the clue here compared to like other shows?
*  It takes over 125 human beings backstage to do this show every day.
*  Now that includes cast and orchestra, but it's not hard enough amount of people to stay
*  in.
*  How many shows have you managed?
*  I'd say it's in the high 2000s, almost 3000 performances.
*  Before my longest job was like 51 weeks.
*  And even the 51 week job is cushy.
*  I think we have this habit in this industry of always looking ahead to what's next, what's
*  next, what's next.
*  Because we're conditioned that our employment is temporary no matter what.
*  Every show closes.
*  This is the perfect example, right?
*  And you think it will run forever and it's going to close.
*  Michael, it feels like there are certain truisms about living in the city, immutable facts
*  of being a resident of New York City.
*  And the first one that comes to mind is there's going to be traffic in Times Square.
*  The second is that the pizza here is not as good as everyone says it is.
*  You'll hear it's better.
*  The third is that if you want to go see Phantom of the Opera on Broadway, it's always going
*  to be available to you.
*  It's a permanent piece of the architecture of the city.
*  And now you're telling me that one of these things is no longer true.
*  Right.
*  And I guess I'm not supposed to choose the pizza.
*  You're not supposed to choose the pizza.
*  It's a moment that those of us who spend our lives immersed in theater never thought
*  was going to happen.
*  The Phantom of the Opera is closing.
*  It felt like it was a show that was going to last forever.
*  And for all intents and purposes, it has.
*  How many years exactly has Phantom been on Broadway?
*  It hit 35 years in January.
*  Well, I mean, by the time Phantom closes on Sunday, that's going to be the 13,981
*  performance.
*  It's been seen by 20 million people and it's made $1.4 billion.
*  I have to admit that while odd by its longevity, I don't know all that much about Phantom
*  the Show.
*  And I love musical theater.
*  You know that Michael, you and I have actually been two shows together.
*  And the thing about Phantom is there was no rush to go see it because there's always
*  going to be there.
*  So I need you to walk me through and help me understand exactly what it is that I've
*  missed and why this show is so integral to musical theater.
*  Let's just start with the show's birth.
*  When it arrives in New York and opens, what does the world of musical theater look like
*  when Phantom comes here?
*  Phantom arrives at sort of an inflection point both for Broadway and for New York City.
*  The 70s were a really rough decade.
*  A lot of people were moving out of the city.
*  There was quite a bit of crime, particularly in Times Square, which of course is where
*  Broadway is located.
*  Where we're located.
*  And where we are located and the art form of musical theater was facing a kind of existential
*  crisis.
*  The number of theaters is going down.
*  The number of shows being produced is low.
*  The neighborhood in which Broadway is located is troubled.
*  New York itself is troubled.
*  And the future is unclear.
*  But at the same time, these musicals from England start to arrive.
*  There's something that's sometimes called the British Invasion.
*  And what are those shows?
*  Well in 1979, comes Evita.
*  And we're going to fly right by Evita without even a ballad.
*  Evita is the origin of the truth is I never left you.
*  I mean look, I skipped Joseph in which I know you played a part in your childhood.
*  Do you want to perform a little bit?
*  No, no, no, no, no, okay, good.
*  And in 1982, there's cats.
*  And the central figure in this British Invasion is this composer named Andrew Lloyd Webber.
*  He's the guy who famously wrote the music for Joseph, for Evita, for cats.
*  And at some point in the mid-80s, he stumbles into a used bookstore and picks up a copy
*  of this 1910 novel, The Phantom of the Opera.
*  And it's in reading that novel that he starts to think seriously about turning this
*  classic story into a musical.
*  And he does.
*  And he does.
*  And just remind us, Michael, of the basic plot of this show that Andrew Lloyd Webber conjures
*  from this novel.
*  I might be embarrassing to ask for this plot, but I need it.
*  Sure.
*  So The Phantom of the Opera is kind of a gothic romance set in 19th century Paris.
*  It tells the story of this disfigured artistic genius, that's of course the Phantom, who
*  lives, hold up underneath the Paris Opera House.
*  And he becomes obsessed with this young soprano named Christine.
*  You alone can make my song take.
*  The Phantom has been tutoring and nurturing and championing Christine, so that she can
*  lead this opera company, but also homicidal in his obsession with her.
*  He's kind of a hidden controller of this opera house.
*  He's extorting money from the guys who own it.
*  And ultimately, Christine falls in love with a childhood friend and decides to marry
*  him.
*  And The Phantom, furious kidnaps her, a mob chases the Phantom and Christine into his
*  layer.
*  And then he vanishes magically just ahead of this group of people coming to get him.
*  He's over now, long years have come.
*  He vanishes with this magical stage effect, leaving behind just the iconic mask.
*  So that's the basic plot.
*  The musical opens in London in 1986, and then two years later, it arrives here in New York
*  on Broadway, 1988.
*  And it's been here ever since.
*  And what is the critical response to the show when it opens in New York?
*  Well, you're laughing.
*  I'm laughing.
*  I mean, I've gone back a few times to read the review in The New York Times by Frank
*  Rich, who was then the theater critic for the paper and sometimes known as the Butcher
*  of Broadway.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  He writes, it may be possible to have a terrible time at The Phantom of the Opera, but you'll
*  have to work at it.
*  Backhand and compliment.
*  Indeed.
*  The review is, I would say, kind of contemptuous of its elements.
*  But it acknowledges that it's effective.
*  And what did audiences make of it?
*  Others loved it before the first performance.
*  There were lines overnight outside the theater to buy tickets.
*  There is something about the show that has enraptured audiences and did so from the beginning.
*  Help me understand that.
*  I mean, I wonder if there's a moment or a song that captures what it is that has people
*  camped out waiting for tickets and falling in love with the show in a way that our colleague
*  Frank Rich did not.
*  I mean, there are a few moments in the show that I think no one who has seen it ever
*  forgets, there's the crashing chandelier, there's the masquerade ball, but I think for many
*  of us, it's when they sing the title song, The Phantom of the Opera.
*  While The Phantom is rowing Christine across his subterranean lake to his lair.
*  And it's like misty and magical.
*  Say for me.
*  Christine, she hits this high E that feels like it could shatter a mirror.
*  As all of this is becoming a cultural phenomenon in that opening year, just how
*  big a head does Phantom become.
*  Look, it's huge.
*  For everyone who has seen this musical comes away in Chanted.
*  Andrew Lloyd Webber is on the cover of Time Magazine.
*  Wow.
*  The show is selling out.
*  There's no question Phantom of the Opera is the entertainment event of the year.
*  And a few months after opening, welcome to the 1988 Tony Awards.
*  Completely dominates at the Tony Awards, which are the biggest annual awards for Broadway.
*  And the winner is The Phantom of the Opera.
*  It wins seven, including the biggest one, which is for best new musical.
*  So more or less a clean sweep.
*  Definitely, it's not only selling out in New York, but it's now touring the United States.
*  The show itself is so big and so spectacular that theaters have to expand their buildings
*  to accommodate it.
*  It is breathing new life into the touring industry.
*  And of course, in New York, it's kind of a bridge between a Broadway that was an existential
*  crisis for the art form and the industry.
*  To an era when musical theater is once again popular.
*  Look, Broadway is an incredibly failure prone industry.
*  Almost 75% of shows flame out.
*  Like, musicals are lucky to run three to five years.
*  And 35 years is completely unheard of.
*  So I've been thinking a lot over the last few months about Phantom's longevity.
*  And one way of thinking about that was to talk to the people involved with the show.
*  And so when the Daily's producers and I went to spend a day backstage,
*  we visited with so many members of the company, cast and crew, just asked them what it has meant
*  to spend so much of their lives working on this single piece of art.
*  And how they're feeling now that it's coming to an end.
*  All right, you ready?
*  How many?
*  Tell me your name.
*  Marie Johnson.
*  Marie Johnson, what do you do at Phantom of the Opera?
*  I do Madame Jerry.
*  I play Madame Jerry.
*  So one thing that really interested me about you is
*  early in your career, you were a Christine, the on-genuse student.
*  Now you are Madame Jerry, who is Christine's teacher, instructor, patron.
*  Yeah.
*  What is the light?
*  The whole age of the show has carried through your life.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's what art replicating life in a way, because I was green when I was cast
*  as Christine.
*  I was a young performer.
*  It was my second show.
*  So it wasn't hard to do in that sense, tapping into who she was.
*  And now, same life has moved on.
*  And I know a lot more.
*  I sort of try to bring that history now to Madame Jerry, a little dark side, a little wiser.
*  You know, we call ourselves the Phantom Family.
*  You know, and families are protective and safe spaces.
*  They're also sometimes a little dysfunctional.
*  So it's truly that.
*  And what just feels like, what feels distinct and special about this show, especially like,
*  you know, there's nothing else like it, I guess.
*  It doesn't feel like it.
*  No, just a sense of family between everybody here.
*  And it's a family with a pH.
*  I used to like hate that term now I can't love this.
*  It's very, very significant to my life.
*  I have two children that were born into the show.
*  They don't know any difference.
*  Currently, it's kind of a lot of my identity.
*  It's like when you get married and you join a family that has a ton of history together,
*  I'm sort of like the new wife.
*  But you've been embraced, you think.
*  Totally.
*  And that's like, it's theater folks.
*  So it's like, there's a lot of heart here.
*  The other day, I came off stage and I just stood in the wings and I totally just
*  had tears streaming down my face.
*  That sounds so corny, but it's true because I was, it was the same feeling that I had when I was for
*  now watching that and what that means.
*  Unstage, these audiences are so nuts because they all have that same thing.
*  And I have it too because I'm a theater nerd at the end of the day.
*  And a fandom nerd.
*  Hello there.
*  Hello there.
*  There's a little tight.
*  A little tight.
*  No one has high heels.
*  The first act is just ended and the crew now has 13 minutes to remake the set for the
*  opening of Act 2, which is the famous Master Aids scene.
*  Sort of with our toes up here.
*  Okay, that way there's room for people to pass behind us.
*  Yeah.
*  As the production stage manager, luckily the 13 minutes of
*  intermission are my closest thing to a break that I ever get in the show.
*  Yeah, I mean being a part of something this big in this long, when you're standing back here,
*  like when you do get a moment, what are you thinking what's going through your mind?
*  Just trying to take a mental snapshot.
*  You know, remember what it, one moment looks like or sounds like or even smells like.
*  We have a lot of power techniques in the show and they each have their own unique
*  afterburn type smell and I can by smelling each of those effects, like I know which
*  point in the show we're in.
*  Hopefully when I'm later on in my career and hopefully people will still want to know about this
*  and ask about it and maybe hopefully this is something that can continue to be celebrated
*  and thought of for a while.
*  Yeah.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Michael, why is Phantom closing?
*  Why is this spectacular seemingly unbreakable juggernaut of a musical theater production finally
*  leaving?
*  Look, I mean the bottom line is that everything runs its course.
*  And Phantom was not exempt from the loss of gravity.
*  It just took longer.
*  The truth is that Phantom has had some brushes with death over the years.
*  It's had periods when it's been doing really well and periods when it's struggling.
*  When you went pre-pandemic, there was an amazing number of people who were non-English speakers
*  in the audience and it was kind of a landmark for global travelers who's in all the guidebooks
*  and then the pandemic arrived.
*  Broadway was closed for a year and a half and Phantom comes back in the fall of 2021,
*  but pretty quickly attendance starts to flag and by 2022, Phantom is having more losing weeks
*  than winning weeks.
*  Right.
*  And there's not a lot of tolerance for that when it comes to Broadway.
*  So you're saying the death bell is starting to gently toll.
*  It's bad and Phantom has some unique vulnerabilities.
*  I mean, first of all, Phantom is a big show.
*  It has a lot of performers.
*  It has a lot of musicians and it has a very big and elaborate set,
*  but it's also really expensive.
*  And we're living in an inflationary environment.
*  Cosses are rising and producers decide they need to move on.
*  And I have to imagine those economic issues aside that after all these decades,
*  the show has possibly also run its artistic course, right?
*  I mean, taste change.
*  Yeah, I mean, you're setting a trap for me here, of course.
*  Emma, I mean, absolutely taste change, artistic forms change, but sure, it was old-fashioned when
*  it opened. I mean, it's set in the 19th century. It's fundamental musical form as opera.
*  And the kind of grandiosity of everything about it is not the aesthetic of 2023.
*  And what do you mean? What is in your mind, the aesthetic of 2023 on Broadway?
*  Sure, I've been thinking a lot about this question. I mean, I think in many ways,
*  Broadway now is sort of bifurcated between two kind of competing forms of performance.
*  Where do you want to begin? From the top.
*  One is this giant branded show. This begins with adaptations of movies.
*  And now we think more about jukebox musicals, which are musicals that are adapted from
*  the song catalogs of pop stars.
*  So I'm thinking about MJ, which is about Michael Jackson.
*  So please put your hands together for a rich debut.
*  And Tino, which is about Tina Turner.
*  Of course, most famously, Jersey boys.
*  You're from my neighborhood, you got three ways out. You could join the army, you could get
*  mobbed up, or you could become a star. There are a ton of musicals arriving on Broadway,
*  kind of pre-branded with very familiar stories or stars or songs.
*  Right, this is a newer variety of show designed to be commercialized. That's well,
*  not considered the great craftsmanship of Broadway.
*  Yeah, some of them are super fun. Some of them are good. A lot of the performances are excellent.
*  But they're probably not the shows that are moving the art form forward.
*  And that's the other vein of show that is happening now.
*  And those are musicals that are really different from Phantom.
*  The musicals that I'm thinking about now are often intimate and psychological
*  and much more focused on storytelling,
*  lyrics, character.
*  I've learned to slam on the break.
*  Think about shows like Dear Evan Hansen.
*  Who's crazy? A husband or a wife? Who's crazy?
*  Next to normal.
*  In your hair, in your dungaries, in your lace-up boots, in your keys, oh.
*  Unhome, these are shows that are much smaller in scale than Phantom. They are naturalistic.
*  They are grappling with contemporary issues. They are prioritizing storytelling over stagecraft.
*  And the content is harder. I mean, fun home. I saw it. That's a show about a young lesbian artist.
*  We visiting her childhood and the death of her closeted father. I mean, that is not
*  Phantom of the Opera. No, Phantom has its own darkness, but its darkness is mythic.
*  And the darkness of these shows is much more familiar. It's the darkness of our neighbors.
*  You know, look to the show that won the Tony most recently.
*  It's called a Strange Loop.
*  And it couldn't be more different than the Phantom of the Opera.
*  It's about a young aspiring musical theater artist who is grappling with a sense that
*  he just doesn't fit into the worlds he wants to be part of.
*  Broadway, gay culture in New York, his own family.
*  Yeah, look, it's raw, it's painful, it's moving, it's provocative, challenging, and all kinds of
*  contemporary ways that tell us a little bit about how the art form and how Broadway have changed
*  in the decades since Phantom arrived. Well, stay with that. I mean, what does a journey that
*  takes you from a Tony award for Phantom in 1988 to a Tony award for a Strange Loop last year?
*  What does that tell us about the evolution of musical theater and about we, the consumer of
*  musical theater and what we now demand from the art form? I think part of what is being celebrated
*  on Broadway and in theater today is people's ability to see themselves represented on stage.
*  These stories are not the kind of mythic fables of Phantom. They are the stories of our contemporaries
*  wrestling with the challenges of modern life. And that's undeniably a very healthy evolution
*  because this is a Broadway, this is a musical theater that better reflects modern reality
*  and its complexities. And yet, this evolution means that the show that the critics love and that
*  the industry crowns is the best is probably not going to have the same appeal as a show like Phantom.
*  Show's like Fun Home, a Strange Loop. Their appeal is narrower. So does Phantom closing bring
*  us to a moment in musical theater where the idea of a universally accessible hit with the craftsmanship
*  of prestige theater is perhaps a little bit in danger. I mean, of course, all of us have been
*  talking for some years about the atomization of taste, right? And when you think about film or
*  television or pop music or theater, there is no longer a kind of consensus about what we all like.
*  What we all like. We don't all like anything anymore. You know, every show aspires to be universal
*  and both Fun Home and a Strange Loop and everything else talks about the universality of its
*  themes, even if its characters are really specific, but the marketplace is telling you that there's
*  something about your promise that is correct because Phantom has made six billion dollars globally
*  and a Strange Loop, you know, closed at a loss on Broadway. Right. Despite winning the Tony.
*  Despite winning the Tony and the Pulitzer and kind of universal critical acclaim.
*  So this is leaving a hole on Broadway, literally, figuratively, aesthetically. And what do we think is
*  going to fill it? Yeah, like the majestic theater, this grand, fantastic building, one of only 41
*  theaters on Broadway, has been locked up by Phantom. And something new is going to go in there. And in a
*  way, that's like a symbol for where we are on Broadway. Like we don't get to know what's ahead.
*  How do you think musical theater has changed? There's a broader palette to choose from.
*  You know, it was so striking when we were backstage talking to Caston, who I expected to encounter a lot of
*  tears and we were getting new audience, different audiences, a more diverse audience. It's sad,
*  it's closing, but it will make way. It'll path the way for new creative input to this story.
*  And I think that's a great thing. People were really not bereft. They were kind of sanguine.
*  They were reflective. I hope the spectacle shows stay. And that's what Broadway is. Broadway is big.
*  It's, you know, it's size. It's, you know, it's important to be able to experience something like that
*  in the big scale. I think, of course, they're sad that this show that they love and that has
*  sustained them for so long is coming to an end. But they also love the theater and they recognize
*  that as Phantom closes, it creates both literal and metaphorical space for another work of art to
*  come in. And that's what everyone looks forward to. Right. As one Phantom closes,
*  another Broadway door opens. As one Phantom closes, another door opens. Yeah.
*  I think Broadway is ever evolving. And what we opened in 1988 has had its time. It's time for
*  there to be new things. So yes, there's loss, but what's to be gained?
*  Oh my god. This is truly a wonderful conversation. So thank you very much. It's so fun talking to you.
*  Aaron Piper plays Ben Mwah.
*  Oh boy.
*  We'll do our best.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Today the Justice Department arrested Jack Douglas DeSherrah in connection with an investigation
*  into alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense
*  information.
*  On Thursday afternoon, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the arrest of a suspect
*  in the embarrassing leak of hundreds of pages of classified military intelligence over
*  the past few months.
*  FBI agents took DeSherrah and Acusty earlier this afternoon without incident.
*  The suspect, Jack DeSherrah, works in the intelligence unit of the Massachusetts National
*  Guard and led an online group where many of the secret documents were first shared.
*  Their disclosure has upset America's allies and exposed the weakness of the Ukrainian
*  Army as it defends itself against Russia.
*  DeSherrah is expected to face charges under the Espionage Act, which makes it a crime to
*  distribute documents related to national defense that could be used to harm the United States
*  or help its enemies.
