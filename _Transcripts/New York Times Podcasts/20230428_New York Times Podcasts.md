# The Ballad of ‘Deepfake Drake’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2sBYP8VCVE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  When an anonymous music producer used artificial intelligence to impersonate Drake earlier
*  this month, it jolted the music industry.
*  Today, my colleague Joe Coscarelli, on the rise and fall of one AI song
*  and what it means for the future of music.
*  It's Friday, April 28th.
*  Joe, welcome to the show.
*  Hey, thanks for having me.
*  So you are a music reporter.
*  That's the world you cover.
*  But this is an episode about artificial intelligence.
*  And artificial intelligence, AI, is something we've covered a lot on the show, but never
*  when it comes to music.
*  So tell me how these two things came together for you in your recent reporting.
*  So there's obviously been a lot of buzz about AI in recent months all across all my social
*  media, you know, television, cover of our newspaper, chat bots and image generators,
*  you know, I'm thinking of chat GPT.
*  Everyone's saying they're the next big thing.
*  What do they mean for various industries?
*  But in my world, you know, the people who make popular music, fans of popular music,
*  the people who build businesses around pop music, AI hadn't really been a thing.
*  There had been some experiments with AI on the fringes of the music business over the
*  years, but they've always seemed a little bit academic or niche.
*  They weren't really touching mainstream culture.
*  You know, they weren't used by the biggest producers or it didn't involve the biggest
*  artists.
*  And these are the people that I tend to cover to write about and to listen to.
*  But then over the last few weeks, there was this massive change.
*  It started like most things in pop music on social media.
*  I started to see videos on my feeds on TikTok, on Instagram, on Twitter, and it just really
*  felt like a moment.
*  And what I was seeing mostly were novelty.
*  Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me.
*  These are memes.
*  They are covers, essentially, of familiar music, familiar songs and artists, very popular
*  ones, but computer generated.
*  You know, a Beyonce song, Cuff It, as sung by A.I. Rihanna.
*  Or Kanye West doing Hey There Delilah by The Plain White Tees.
*  These really strange combinations, but ones that people were obviously taking notice of
*  because who wouldn't want to hear their favorite rapper rap a song by their other favorite
*  rapper?
*  It's just, you know, it's a strange mashup.
*  So kind of like a deep fake, but for music.
*  Exactly.
*  These A.I. vocal technologies have gotten better and better at generating human voices,
*  especially voices we're familiar with, like Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
*  Hey guys, can we talk for a minute?
*  I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything going on.
*  Of course, Joe, what's on your mind?
*  It's just that the weight of the presidency can be a lot to bear.
*  The decisions I make impact the lives of millions of people.
*  And I feel like I'm constantly under a microscope.
*  I know exactly how you feel, Joe.
*  There were times when I felt like the media was always looking for a way to bring me down.
*  Because these vocal models are trained from actual recordings, they're extremely accurate
*  when it comes to people who we hear from a lot.
*  Because there's so many recordings.
*  Exactly.
*  And it sort of drew people's attention to the possibilities that were starting to become
*  available from this A.I. technology.
*  And people could do this at home on their own laptops in only a few minutes.
*  Right.
*  So as people like having fun, just kind of like spoofing or kind of covering using their
*  computers, their favorite songs, using voices from their favorite artists from other places.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what would it be like if Nicki Minaj did a Frank Sinatra song?
*  What was it like?
*  I haven't heard that one.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  So it's fun, but it's kind of a novelty.
*  Yeah.
*  You would see these things pop up on Instagram, on TikTok, on Twitter, and they were lightweight.
*  They were harmless.
*  But they sort of foretold all of this potential for how this technology could be used in the
*  music industry.
*  And then a couple of weeks ago, in the middle of April, I'm lying in bed on a Saturday morning
*  scrolling Twitter, and there was one song that just wouldn't go away.
*  And this song, called Heart on My Sleeve, claimed to use A.I.
*  The Weeknd to create an entirely new track.
*  And over and over again, I'm seeing, oh my God, this A.I.
*  Drake song is so good.
*  It's basically a Drake song.
*  You know, I like Drake as much as the next guy.
*  And so I click play, and you know, it has all the touchstones there of what a Drake
*  track sounds like.
*  It has a little piano beat that's not great, but sounds maybe like Drake would rap on it.
*  The lyrics right away are sort of using subject matter that would be in a Drake song that's
*  on the radio.
*  You know, he's referencing famous friends of his and The Weeknd's.
*  He's copying Drake's cadence, his flows, the way he delivers lyrics.
*  And the song is called Heart on My Sleeve, which is a sort of nod to what most people
*  know about Drake, which is that he's maybe more emotional than your average rapper.
*  And then an A.I.
*  version of The Weeknd starts singing in a replica of his trademark falsetto.
*  And the collaboration is also exciting because Drake and The Weeknd used to make a lot of
*  music together and they no longer do.
*  So the fans, this was like wish fulfillment in some way for the fans.
*  And all told, when you put it all together, it's not so different from songs that Drake
*  and The Weeknd have actually made together.
*  And who made it?
*  Who created this thing?
*  So it seems to have been seeded across social media and streaming services like YouTube
*  and Spotify by someone calling themselves Ghostwriter.
*  Ghostwriter is a term in the music industry for someone who works in the shadows in studios
*  helping big artists come up with their tracks and then not really getting credit for it.
*  So this is interesting.
*  So this is different from the Kanye stuff, which was essentially regular people having
*  fun on the internet with a bit of A.I. doing spoofs and cover songs.
*  This is actually someone who knows what they're doing actually composing real music to sound
*  using A.I. like one of the world's most famous artists.
*  Yeah, what seems to be happening here is that there's a songwriter with enough skills in
*  the studio to write a Drake song that is then using A.I. technology to make it sound as
*  if Drake is the one performing it.
*  So do people know it's not Drake?
*  Most people know that it's not Drake.
*  And part of the novelty factor is that it's being presented as A.I.
*  But I think there's enough gray area that people want to hear it for themselves.
*  And it's a good enough copy that the song starts to snowball and becomes really popular.
*  By the end of the weekend, it's gone totally viral and millions of people have heard it
*  across TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and even Spotify and YouTube, where official streams
*  are counted.
*  If it would have continued on this pace, it could have very easily made the Billboard
*  Hot 100 right next to a real Drake song.
*  Wow.
*  Interesting.
*  So really went viral and has this huge pickup.
*  Yeah, I think there's a combination of factors.
*  People who think it's a good song and will take a new Drake song, whether or not he actually
*  made it, and also people who want to hear just how far this A.I. technology has come.
*  So then what happens?
*  All of this plays out over a weekend, which really gives the song space to grow and for
*  its virality to spread far and wide.
*  But by Monday morning, the corporations involved have seemingly had enough.
*  So Universal Music Group, the biggest of the three major labels and the one that represents
*  both Drake and The Weeknd, gets this song pulled down from all the official streaming
*  services like Spotify and YouTube.
*  Huh.
*  Okay.
*  How do they do that?
*  So it's interesting because the legal questions around A.I. music are still very much unsettled.
*  It's a real gray area, whether or not impersonating someone's voice is enough to get a song taken
*  down.
*  In the past, there have been some court cases that say artists have a right to their likeness,
*  to the sound of their own voice, especially if a copy is being passed off as legitimate.
*  But we haven't really seen this legal precedent applied to A.I.
*  So in this case, it seems like they were able to get the song removed not because the song
*  is impersonating Drake, but because the producer, Ghostwriter, included a tiny clip of another
*  song that was actually already copyrighted.
*  So that allowed the companies to use their normal process for when they try to get a
*  song taken down.
*  Interesting.
*  So in fact, it had nothing to do with A.I., their ability to take it down.
*  That's right.
*  It seems like this was just a bit of an unforced error by Ghostwriter to include something
*  that was copyrighted instead of something that was just in this gray area.
*  But it sounds like in any case, the party was over.
*  Yeah, for this particular song at least.
*  But I think overall, it was clear that a line had been crossed and the industry, which had
*  never really had to contend with the idea that A.I. was a threat to their business,
*  had to pay attention because they knew more and more songs like this would keep popping
*  up.
*  So while Heart on My Sleeve may have been gone, the legal and creative questions that
*  it raised were obviously here to stay.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Joe, Drake's label, Universal, gets Spotify to take the song down.
*  How are they thinking about this stuff?
*  Universal didn't address this song specifically.
*  They never mentioned Drake or The Weeknd, and they certainly didn't want to give any
*  attention to Ghostwriter.
*  But they do release this statement the day the song gets taken down.
*  And it's this big, sweepy corporate thing that tries to frame this fight as, you know,
*  a cosmic battle between good and evil.
*  The statement basically asks people in the music industry and who might use A.I. which
*  side of history they want to be on.
*  On the side of artists, fans, and human creative expression, or on the side of deepfakes, fraud,
*  and denying artists their due compensation.
*  Okay, so when you put it like that, that seems pretty straightforward, right?
*  I want to be on the side of artists and human expression.
*  Yeah, I think Universal sees this from a couple of different angles.
*  They don't want random music producers using Drake's sound and his celebrity to make money.
*  They want to be making money off of Drake.
*  They also don't want these A.I. tools to be able to learn from the music that Drake and
*  The Weeknd and their ilk have already put out.
*  That's copyrighted material.
*  But can they even control that?
*  I mean, tell the computers of the world that they can't scrape the internet to listen to
*  Drake songs because the Drake songs are copyrighted.
*  I mean, they're just out there, right?
*  That's true, but they can try.
*  A lot of people have compared the rise in A.I. music to file sharing, to Napster.
*  And these were issues for the labels back in the day where they got caught a little
*  bit flat footed.
*  Every time there's a rise in new technology, the labels want to find a way to get in on
*  it.
*  But in the meantime, they have to sort of play whack-a-mole with people doing it on
*  their own.
*  So that means getting their partners like Spotify and YouTube and Apple Music to take
*  down songs that come from copyrighted material.
*  But at the same time, they're trying to work with these A.I. companies behind the scenes
*  and say, your machines can learn from our catalog, you just have to pay us.
*  And the other thing that labels like Universal are doing is trying to invest in their own
*  A.I. innovation.
*  So they're okay with using A.I. as long as it's authorized.
*  Huh, interesting.
*  So they're not just going around trying to get stuff taken down, they're also trying
*  to harness this power.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So tell me about that, Joe.
*  How is A.I. being used to make music more broadly?
*  There's a few different categories of what we're calling generative A.I. music.
*  What we don't have just yet is an A.I. bot that can create a song from a simple text
*  prompt where you would say, make me a song by Drake in the Weekend and it would spit
*  the whole thing back out at you wholesale.
*  Okay.
*  What we do have are tools that professional musicians and even amateur musicians in their
*  bedrooms can use in bits and pieces.
*  Songwriters could use a chat bot like ChatGBT to come up with lyrics in the style of another
*  artist.
*  Or a producer could use A.I. technology to create little loops of a guitar riff, for
*  instance, or a drum beat or a horn sound.
*  One example that gained some popularity even before the Drake track...
*  This is the future rave sound, I'm getting lost in an underground.
*  This is the future rave sound, I'm getting lost in an underground.
*  ...was one by the French DJ David Guetta who had used A.I. to make an Eminem song.
*  There's something that I made as a joke and it worked so good I could not believe it.
*  I discovered those websites that are about A.I.
*  He used a chat bot to come up with lyrics in the style of the rapper Eminem.
*  And I went to another A.I. website that can recreate the voice...
*  And then he has a David Guetta track that sounds as if it features Eminem.
*  And I played the record and people went nuts.
*  This is the future rave sound, I'm getting lost in an underground.
*  So David Guetta, this French DJ, wants Eminem to rap on one of his songs, but he doesn't
*  need him because he can just replace him with A.I.
*  Which kind of sounds like exactly what Ghostwriter did with Drake, right?
*  That's right, but the key distinction here is that David Guetta wasn't trying to sell
*  his song.
*  He sees this as an artistic experiment, but he's not putting it on Spotify where it can
*  make actual money.
*  And what do artists think about this?
*  Like Eminem and others who are being used in this way.
*  Or Drake for that matter.
*  Drake hasn't commented specifically on Ghostwriter's Heart on My Sleeve.
*  The Drakes and the Weekends and the Eminems of the world know how big their fan base is
*  and how intense that connection can be between listeners and their favorite artists who have
*  invested in them as people over the years and really want to hear what they have to
*  say, what they're feeling.
*  So I think they're not sweating just yet.
*  At the same time, there are other artists who see this as a creative possibility.
*  They think it's cool for people to try their voice on as another instrument in their toolkit.
*  So you have independent singers like Grimes or this artist I spoke to for my piece, Holly
*  Herndon, who are saying, go ahead, use this tool, use my voice however you want.
*  You have my permission.
*  But they were okay with that?
*  Just like giving away their voice like that?
*  I think they realized that this is happening whether they like it or not.
*  And they want to see what people can pull off.
*  It reminds me of the beginnings of sampling in hip hop where disco records all of a sudden
*  become the basis for a completely new genre.
*  Right.
*  And at the time that felt pretty radical.
*  Yeah.
*  And innovation often comes out of people breaking the rules or doing things that make people
*  or corporations feel uncomfortable.
*  But Grimes is saying that if people do make money off of her voice, she should be paid
*  a cut.
*  So she's trying to get ahead of the business problems.
*  I think the risks come when you realize that with Grimes' voice as a tool, you could make
*  it sound like she's saying or feeling anything you want.
*  This raises all sorts of questions about identity and creativity and cultural appropriation.
*  A white artist could record a song and then make it sound as if Kanye West is rapping
*  their words.
*  Right.
*  In its most extreme form, there are critics who see these vocal fakes as yet another form
*  of digital blackface.
*  You can put the words of a white creator into the mouth of a black artist.
*  Say more about that.
*  The history of American popular music is full of appropriation, specifically white artists
*  who take, borrow, and steal from black artists.
*  Rock and roll, Elvis, the Rolling Stones, success of certain white rappers.
*  That's always been there.
*  So the uncomfortable thing about this technology is that it could allow for a much easier way
*  of impersonating people.
*  One thing an artist brings to the table is their identity, their culture, their biography.
*  And to just be able to try on that voice like a costume raises a lot of complicated questions.
*  Right.
*  Life experience, identity, culture, these are some of the things that make music human.
*  And if you take those things out of the music, then what is it?
*  I think that's ultimately what worries and interests me the most about these AI technologies
*  in general.
*  Right now, maybe it's just a vocal impersonation, but what about when AI is writing the lyrics
*  and the melody and impersonating a human wholesale?
*  For me, I'm a music reporter and a fan.
*  I'm obsessed with the people who are creating this stuff.
*  What I'm listening for is the human being behind the music, if they sound angry or sad
*  or confident or in love.
*  As a listener, you assume that that's real on some level.
*  There's this connection between the listener and the human being performing and writing
*  these songs.
*  But the question AI raises is, do we even need that connection?
*  Do we just want something that sounds pleasant enough in the background?
*  Oh, that sort of sounds like Drake or that sort of sounds like Bob Dylan.
*  Or do we need to know that this is coming from the depths of their soul and from their
*  lungs and their heart?
*  Maybe we do or maybe we don't, but as AI keeps coming in music and in other art forms, we're
*  all going to have to answer that question for ourselves.
*  Joe, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Thursday, numbers released by the Commerce Department showed that the American economy
*  was growing at a slower pace.
*  Fresh evidence that the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool it were having an effect.
*  Gross domestic product rose by just over 1% last quarter.
*  That was down from 2.6% in the previous quarter.
*  The factors slowing growth included a slowdown in the housing market and companies pulling
*  back on hiring.
*  But consumer spending was still rising at a rapid rate, keeping the U.S. for now out
*  of a recession.
*  And talk show host Jerry Springer died Thursday.
*  He was 79.
*  Welcome to the show.
*  Our guests today say they've been keeping a secret from a loved one far too long.
*  Springer's wildly popular program, The Jerry Springer Show, set a new standard for tawdryness
*  on American television.
*  He encouraged everyday people to make shocking confessions, engage in high drama screaming
*  matches and get in regular fistfights on stage.
*  The show, which ran for three decades, ushered in a new era of daytime television and made
*  Springer a cultural phenomenon.
*  Today's episode was produced by Will Reed and Michael Simon Johnson with help from Nina
*  Feldman.
*  It was edited by Liz O'Balin with help from Michael Benoit, contains original music by
*  Dan Powell and Marian Lozano, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
