*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tarranisi, and this is The Daily.
*  On Friday, the Supreme Court delivered another major decision on the last day of its term,
*  ruling in favor of a web designer who argued that having to create websites for same-sex
*  marriages violated her right to free speech.
*  Today, my colleague Adam Liptack on how the ruling puts freedom of expression above freedom
*  from discrimination, and what that might mean for all kinds of different groups of Americans.
*  It's Monday, July 3rd.
*  Adam, you're back.
*  Hello, Sabrina.
*  So this time you're here for another major case, one potentially with far-reaching consequences
*  for same-sex couples.
*  Tell me about the ruling.
*  So, this is the end of June when we get the big cases, and this is one we've been waiting
*  for for many months.
*  The question is whether a website designer with religious convictions can refuse to provide
*  services to same-sex couples for same-sex marriages.
*  And the court, by the usual 6-3 split with the six Republican appointees in the majority,
*  says, yes, she can.
*  She has a first amendment free speech right, not to be compelled by the government to say
*  things she doesn't believe.
*  She says that same-sex marriages are false, and that in having to comply with a Colorado
*  anti-discrimination law that forbids discrimination on many grounds, including sexual orientation,
*  the government is making her violate her free speech rights by compelling her to say something
*  she doesn't believe.
*  In other words, she has the right not to make a website for same-sex couples who are
*  getting married because they're same-sex couples, something she disagrees with.
*  There is an established first amendment doctrine called compelled speech that says you
*  can't force school children to say the pledge of allegiance.
*  You can't require people to in New Hampshire have a license plate that says live free or die.
*  And whether that concept fits neatly here is open to question, but the Supreme Court adopts
*  that concept or the majority does and says that this anti-discrimination law as applied
*  to a web designer engaged in expressive conduct violates the first amendment.
*  This is sounding vaguely familiar.
*  I'm thinking about that case a while back, about a cake baker who didn't want to bake a cake
*  for a same-sex sweating also in Colorado.
*  It was about five miles away from where this web designer works.
*  You're right to remember that case.
*  It involved a baker named Jack Phillips who made custom wedding cakes.
*  He said they were artistic works.
*  And he refused service to a same-sex couple was punished for it.
*  That case went all the way to the Supreme Court, but we didn't get a definitive decision in that case.
*  And remind me why Adam? What happened?
*  I think the real reason was that the controlling vote was that of Justice Anthony Kennedy since retired.
*  Justice Kennedy was on the one hand the court's greatest proponent of gay rights, the author of all four major constitutional pro-gay rights decisions,
*  but also very sensitive to first amendment free speech concerns.
*  And I just don't think you could make up his mind.
*  I just don't think that's the case.
*  I think that's the case.
*  I think it's the case that the court has done an off-ramp ruling in favor of the baker on quite narrow technical idiosyncratic grounds.
*  None of that is important to follow.
*  The only larger point is that there was no decision.
*  And we've been waiting now for years for the Supreme Court to return to this topic.
*  Okay. So now this case comes along with this web designer.
*  Tell me about it, the person at the heart of the case.
*  Laurie Smith.
*  I've painted her a visit some months ago as the case was soon to be argued.
*  So Laurie, tell me about you. Tell me about your business. What do you do here?
*  Sure. So you're in my studio. This is 303 Creative.
*  You're on Little Team Colorado.
*  And she told me her story.
*  So from a family of entrepreneurs, I always wanted to own my own business and I've always been creative.
*  She starts her own business, which makes ads and logos and websites.
*  So custom logos, custom artwork, custom designs.
*  For a variety of businesses.
*  Nothing I create. No two things are the same.
*  So everything's custom expression and artwork and nature.
*  And she sees herself as an artist and thinks that every piece of work she does for this business is unique.
*  So my clients are coming to me because they're not looking for like a boilerplate template.
*  And she also says she's eager to go into a new business.
*  She wants to provide websites for weddings.
*  When I started creating, I made a decision that the things that I create and sign for,
*  it would be honoring and glorifying the God.
*  And because of that, that means that I can't create all messages.
*  But I worked with that.
*  But she says her Christian faith would not allow her to create websites for same sex weddings.
*  And I want to create weddings consistent with my faith, which teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.
*  She says she'll serve gay couples in all kinds of settings.
*  I love everyone. I serve everyone. I have a client who identifies LGBT.
*  I just can't promote every message and not just not in connection with the same sex marriages.
*  But the state says that I can't do that.
*  And she's afraid that if she goes into this business, but only serves opposite sex couples,
*  she'll be punished by the state of Colorado under its anti-discrimination laws.
*  For me, I cautiously looked around the nature of the environment in Colorado.
*  And I saw what was happening with people like Jack Phillips who has a similar faith to me.
*  And I wondered if the state could do the same to me.
*  And she thinks that because she is actually familiar with the cake Baker case.
*  She knows Jack Phillips, the baker in the case.
*  And she knew she might run the risk of getting in trouble with Colorado as he did,
*  if she were to turn down business based on same sex marriages.
*  So how do you get involved in this lawsuit?
*  Well, it started about six years ago.
*  She gets together with a big Christian litigating firm called Alliance Defending Freedom,
*  which it also represented Jack Phillips.
*  And they file suit.
*  And they do so before she's actually opened her doors to this kind of business.
*  They say that she has reason to be afraid that she'll face punishment
*  if she starts into this business but won't serve same sex couples for same sex weddings.
*  And so rather than wait to be punished, I decided to take a stand to protect my first amendment rights.
*  And I shouldn't have to be punished before I challenge an unjust law.
*  So there's really not a real life dispute here, right?
*  She's just trying to kind of head off the potential for a dispute that she thinks she might have if she expands her business.
*  Right.
*  In the case with the cake maker, there was detailed record evidence in the court files on who had done what when.
*  And it really added some texture and context to the case.
*  In this case, Smith said she had received but never responded to a request from what looked like a same sex couple.
*  Now, according to recent reports, the request was bogus, submitted under the name of a straight man.
*  But in any event, the case is very different from that of the baker.
*  Right. He actually had denied baking a cake to an actual couple, right?
*  So as you say, they were facts in the case here.
*  She hasn't denied service to anyone.
*  It's kind of something that might happen in the future.
*  Right. So we don't know what the request would look like.
*  We don't know what any resulting website would look like.
*  It's an odd thing to have a Supreme Court decision based on so little evidence.
*  But obviously, nonetheless, the case makes it all the way up to the Supreme Court.
*  Right. And you have to think that Alliance defending freedom had wanted to find another plaintiff in another case.
*  To get back to the Supreme Court, particularly as its composition had changed as it had become more conservative.
*  And when the case arrives at the Supreme Court, it seems like a sequel to the case about the baker.
*  And it is. But the baker's case had two pieces to it.
*  It had a religious component whether the Colorado anti-discrimination law violated his right to free exercise of religion.
*  And also whether it violated his right to free speech to free expression.
*  Okay.
*  This time around the court only grants the free speech question.
*  So we're looking at a case which has heavy overtones of a classic clash between religion and gay rights.
*  But it takes the form of a question about free speech.
*  Okay. So instead of this being a fight about religion and free speech versus discrimination, it's just free speech versus discrimination.
*  Right. The court apparently thought the best way to handle this question is in a streamlined fashion and really bear down on whether the First Amendment's free expression protection applies even in the face of an anti-discrimination law.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay.
*  Okay. So how did we get to this ruling from the Supreme Court last week?
*  Well, after the court agrees to hear the case, they hear argument in December.
*  Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
*  Laurie Smith blends art with technology to me.
*  And it starts by Laurie Smith's lawyer, Kristen Wagner getting up and making basically the same points that Smith made to me.
*  Smith believes opposite sex marriage on her scripture and same sex marriage contradicts it.
*  She has religious convictions. She shouldn't be forced to violate them by saying things she doesn't believe that the First Amendment protects her in this area.
*  And what are the justices make of that argument?
*  Well, the justices were really trying to sort out what kinds of businesses are we talking about that can invoke the First Amendment at all.
*  How do you characterize website designers? Are they more like the restaurants and the jewelers and the tailors?
*  Or are they more like the publishing houses and the other free speech analogues that are raised on the other?
*  Many people would agree that a painter, a songwriter, the ghost writer of a biography engages in First Amendment protected activity and therefore might have a claim.
*  But not, for example, a shoe store or Walmart or a tire company.
*  Right. If you're just any regular business facing the public, you don't have those rights if what you're selling isn't your own expression.
*  So the two ends of the spectrum are pretty well defined.
*  But I thought that there really isn't that clear a distinction in a situation like this.
*  And that didn't answer the question about whether this web designer in this context was engaging in expression.
*  Can I give you a hypothetical? It's not really a hybrid.
*  Just to Selena Kagan, for instance, says what if what you're offering is basically a template.
*  There's lots of graphics. You have typefaces and basically, you know, clients are coming in and they're saying, we just want a standard website.
*  You know, that tells people where to stay and how to travel there. And the question is, can a website designer say, sorry, that's not my kind of marriage?
*  Does that amount to Laurie Smith's expression? How much creativity does she need to bring to the project?
*  So I think that if I understand you, you're saying, yes, she can refuse because there's ideology just in the fact that it's Mike and Harry and there's a picture of these two guys together.
*  That is speech you are announcing a wedding.
*  There are questions about how much will people understand the resulting speech to be hers as opposed to the couples.
*  So what's the message if it says save the date, really and really and really and married? What's the message there?
*  That's an invitation to celebrate a marriage.
*  Why is it your invitation?
*  So I mean, if you look at a wedding website, are you going to go, well, that's interesting. What Laurie Smith thinks about same sex marriage?
*  Or are you going to think here's something that perhaps in consultation with an artist, but nevertheless was created by and is the speech of the couple.
*  Another major question is how broadly would a ruling in favor of Laurie Smith sweep?
*  Can I ask you a hypothetical that just sort of helps me to flesh that out?
*  Just as Katanya Brown-Jackson, for instance, asked an interesting hypothetical question.
*  Can you give me your thoughts on a photography business in a shopping mall during this holiday season that offers a product called Scenes with Santa.
*  And this business wants to express its own view of nostalgia about it.
*  Let's assume a shopping mall wants to have a kind of 1950s, sepia-toned Christmas setting in which they say black children shouldn't participate because that's not their vision of what the 1950s in America was all about.
*  Would that be acceptable? That's a kind of speech, I guess, setting up a Christmas scene in a shopping mall.
*  And are you allowed to discriminate that way?
*  So she seems to be suggesting that a ruling in favor of Smith could actually go way beyond a web designer's religious objections that it could be a slippery slope.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  But even if it were, this court has protected vile, awful, reprehensible, violent speech in the past.
*  And it has never come back.
*  No, I'm just asking you why is the objection?
*  An important point to recognize is that let's recall we're not talking about religious belief alone.
*  We're talking about any belief.
*  And that belief can be quite ugly. It can be, you know, an anti-Muslim belief.
*  It can be the idea that women shouldn't participate in the workforce.
*  It could protect all kinds of discrimination.
*  So long as we're talking about expressive speech delivered on a custom basis.
*  Got it.
*  Meanwhile, some of the conservative justices suggested there might be a slippery slope in the other direction as well.
*  But the problem in what a lot of the hypotheticals are getting at is however we decide this case obviously applies to others.
*  And what if we say nothing?
*  And in court, the justices were grappling with Will.
*  Where would the line be if this Colorado law was left in place?
*  Couldn't that leave the door open?
*  To at least some companies having to take on all kinds of work that they deeply disagree with?
*  Does every press release, free-lance writer have to write a press release for the Church of Scientology say,
*  even though the beliefs of that institution may be inimical to the person?
*  And the more the justices talk, the more it becomes apparent that they're finding these questions to be pretty hard.
*  You could say, I asked for a yes. Colorado would compel that person.
*  No, if the answer is no, okay.
*  Why?
*  Because...
*  So there are, as lawyers like to say, a lot of line drawing questions here.
*  At the conclusion of the argument though, I think I thought, and most observers thought,
*  that the six justice conservative majority would find a way to rule for Lori Smith was basically sympathetic to her position.
*  And that may have been inflected by the particular context of the case,
*  that she was a Christian woman opposed to same-sex marriage.
*  And this is a court that's very receptive to claims based on religion, particularly from Christians.
*  And maybe is not as sympathetic in cases involving gay rights as it might be in other cases involving other forms of discrimination.
*  And of course, Adam, you were right during the oral arguments to assume what you did assume that is exactly what they ruled.
*  So tell me about the specifics of this decision.
*  Justice Neil Gorsuch writes for the six justice majority.
*  And he basically says, you know, it's true.
*  There are some hard questions here.
*  There are some thorny questions.
*  But the question in this particular case, he says, is an easy one, that Lori Smith has a first amendment, right,
*  not to be compelled by the government to make websites for same-sex weddings,
*  even in the face of a Colorado law that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation.
*  So basically, they duck the thorny issues and say, she's right.
*  They kind of take her argument at face value.
*  Right. And I guess I'd say they take her facts at face value, because they said that she was basically an artist,
*  that she was engaged in expression.
*  She had earnestly held views about same-sex marriage, and that she shouldn't be forced to say something she didn't believe.
*  And in Gorsuch's opinion, is there any limit to what a so-called expressive creative business can do when it comes to denying services?
*  Like if she, Lori Smith, wanted to refuse services based on a different kind of belief, say a belief that interracial marriage is wrong.
*  Would denying a couple of wedding website be protected in that case, according to his opinion?
*  So the decision is very closely tied to the facts of the particular case.
*  But the logic of the decision certainly extends to other kinds of discrimination.
*  I was particularly curious about what Gorsuch would have to say about discrimination based on race.
*  And I was surprised enough that I wasn't finding that discussion, that I did a word search and a document to make sure I wasn't missing something.
*  And although the dissent discusses racial discrimination, there's nothing about that in the majority opinion.
*  So the opinion leaves open two kinds of questions.
*  One of them just how far some businesses can go in discriminating against people in various settings.
*  But it also doesn't answer the threshold question of what businesses qualify as expressive businesses in the first place.
*  So just as Gorsuch seems to studiously avoid drawing lines and distinctions and is deciding the particular case without announcing general legal principles.
*  And the Supreme Court usually is in the business of announcing general legal principles.
*  So as this decision kind of makes its way out into the world, you know, the majority has not defined exactly what an expressive business is.
*  It feels like that's going to be the center of the debate, right?
*  Going forward.
*  I mean, this is incredibly squishy.
*  And it seems like this opinion really does everything it can not to wait into that squishiness.
*  That's right.
*  And you can portray that in two ways, one that it's narrowly focused.
*  In the other in not addressing those other scenarios, it may open the door to all kinds of litigation and mischief.
*  And just as Sonia Sonomaira's descent sure makes the point that it's hard to distinguish based on the logic of the decision.
*  Other kinds of discrimination, for instance, and she has a lot of examples, but once she offers is what if a business offers school photos.
*  Can it deny those services to multiracial children because the owner does not want to create any speech indicating that interracial couples are acceptable?
*  I don't think Justice Gorsuch's majority has an answer for that or at least not one that he is offered.
*  So she's talking about the slippery slope and the negative possible effects from that.
*  Right. She's saying that after the civil rights movement of the 1960s, we have gotten to a place in the United States where everyone has accepted that businesses open to the public can't discriminate.
*  And here all of a sudden we're moving in the opposite direction on the basis of a First Amendment doctrine that has not previously been used to allow discrimination.
*  She's basically saying this is discrimination, pure and simple.
*  Yeah, and I'm not sure Lori Smith would say that she's discriminating. She might not adopt that language.
*  But in making distinctions based on her faith and declining to serve people, it is a form of discrimination, but maybe the First Amendment allows it.
*  So Adam, at the end of the day, this really limits the power of anti-discrimination laws, right? Like how will they govern and be the law of the land in this new environment that we're in after this ruling?
*  I agree with you Sabrina that it's a significant step, but let's also recognize the limits.
*  It applies to a relatively narrow class of businesses. It applies to those businesses when they're doing customized expression.
*  And it only comes into play if the business probably contrary to their economic interests wants to discriminate against groups of people.
*  And it's true that most anti-discrimination laws will be enforceable tomorrow just as they were yesterday.
*  But at the same time, the message of the decision seems powerfully symbolic.
*  In a clash between a woman's religious faith and gay rights, religion comes out ahead.
*  Or a cynic might say that this is a decision in the aftermath of the court's ruling establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, which has remained unpopular in some quarters and is a signal in the culture wars that same-sex marriages don't get quite the same protections as other marriages.
*  So even though the ruling was based on free speech, you're saying it's important symbolically that this was specifically about a religious belief in same-sex marriage.
*  Yes, so there are two ways to look at the decision. One is that it's a question about free speech and it applies in all kinds of settings.
*  But I don't know that it gets to the Supreme Court. If it didn't involve the contentious issue of same-sex marriage and the feeling among some religious people that it remains a contested and offensive concept.
*  Adam, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  I am so disappointed with this decision and it actually almost brings me to tears.
*  On Friday, in a six to three decision, the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's plan to cancel a portion of student loan debt for individual borrowers.
*  We were looking forward to student loan forgiveness. We were actually expecting that that's going to crush us financially.
*  Federal student loan debt has risen to more than $1.6 trillion nationwide. The plan specifically targeted lower earners, offering up to $20,000 of debt cancellation for those making less than $125,000 a year.
*  We, California, can't afford housing and groceries.
*  Who do they think are going to pay these back? Because it's not me.
*  The court said the plan, which had not yet gone into effect, overstepped the authority of the Department of Education and required approval of Congress.
*  I know there are millions of Americans, millions of Americans in this country who feel disappointed and discouraged or even a little bit angry about the court decision to die on student debt. And I must admit I do too.
*  Speaking at the White House on Friday, President Biden made his displeasure with the court's decision clear.
*  I believe the court's decision to strike down my student debt relief program as a mistake was wrong. I'm not going to stop fighting to deliver borrowers what they need, particularly those at the bottom end of economic scale.
*  He announced he would continue the fight for debt relief and was directing the Secretary of Education to find new ways to ease the economic burden for borrowers.
*  Today's decision has closed one path. Now we're going to pursue another.
