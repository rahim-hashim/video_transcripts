*  My name is Andrew Kramer. I'm a reporter for The New York Times.
*  I'm standing on the highway where Ukrainian troops are moving tanks and armored vehicles into Russia.
*  Every few minutes we have tanks, trucks with soldiers rumbling past
*  and in the direction of Russia.
*  From The New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Ukraine sliced through the border area, pushed through minefields and thinly manned defenses,
*  and has been pressing deeper into Russia.
*  When Ukraine's military crossed over into Russia two weeks ago,
*  it appeared at first to be a largely symbolic gesture.
*  But in the time since, it's emerged as a defining moment in the two-year-old war.
*  This is the first major military incursion into Russia since World War II.
*  Today, Andrew Kramer on what's behind the audacious Ukrainian operation,
*  and Anton Troyanovsky on how Russia's response could reshape the conflict.
*  It's Wednesday, August 21st.
*  Andrew, I wonder if you can take us back to the moment when you discovered
*  that this pretty unimaginable thing had occurred.
*  Ukrainian troops entering Russian territory and turning the basic equation of this war upside down.
*  Well, the entire operation was shrouded in secrecy.
*  So the first reports were actually from Russian social media posts,
*  and everything was a little bit vague.
*  We were seeing reports of fighting along the border,
*  but nothing indicating the scale of what was to come.
*  The secret was very well guarded.
*  It wasn't clear until the second day that this was more than a border skirmish,
*  that this was a full Ukrainian military invasion of Russia,
*  and that Ukraine had taken control of a rural area in the southwestern part of Russia.
*  So what do you do there in Kiev, where I imagine you're absorbing this information,
*  once you realize that such a major turning point in this conflict has just begun to unfold?
*  Well, we decided to head out to the border region in northeastern Ukraine
*  and have a look at how this appeared on the ground.
*  And this required a little bit of logistics.
*  We used an armored car that the Bureau has.
*  I don't think I knew that we had an armored car.
*  We do.
*  And initially we were watching and talking to soldiers and officers about this incursion,
*  and then also creeping forward toward the border to get a firsthand look.
*  And we drove over a very high plain where the road passes into Russia,
*  and it's a very rural area of cornfields and country roads.
*  And then ahead of us was the border, completely unguarded,
*  seemingly deserted, at least from a distance.
*  So this was a remarkable moment.
*  As somebody who covered Russia, the idea of the Russian border being open and deserted
*  by the Russian military was really remarkable.
*  And once you get inside, what are you seeing?
*  We got out of the car and looked around and saw really a tableau of destruction.
*  This was a Russian administrative building, maybe three stories tall at one point,
*  before it was bombarded.
*  Now sheet metal was just flapping in the wind.
*  All the windows were blown out.
*  And we looked around and there were craters in the ground from artillery and debris.
*  Shells from a firefight were tinkling underfoot when we walked.
*  And there were customs forms and other administrative documents blowing on the ground.
*  And a little bit farther on, there was a sign over the road that said Russia.
*  It was a very eerie scene.
*  And what we were looking at was the detritus of a lost battle to defend the Russian border.
*  So we walked around this site and we noticed some Ukrainian soldiers
*  who were wearing surgical masks.
*  And it became clear that what we were seeing was a grim task by these soldiers of clearing
*  the bodies of dead Russians from this building that had been destroyed in the initial
*  attack on the Russian border.
*  We watched them load bodies and zip them into body bags.
*  And this was really, you know, a grim scene of just what a difficult fight and losing
*  fight this had been for Russian border guards at this site.
*  This section of the border had likely been chosen in part because it was guarded by
*  Russian conscript soldiers.
*  And these are very green and experienced soldiers who've been drafted after high school.
*  And in almost all cases that we know of, they retreated, abandoned their positions,
*  or they surrendered.
*  There were small arms, cartridges, and there were sandbags in this location,
*  firing positions.
*  But there was no indication that they were expecting an army to come across the border
*  at them.
*  So after about 40 minutes, we decided it was time to go and got back in our armored car
*  and drove back into Ukraine, back into the relative safety of the cities far from the
*  front line.
*  Once you return to Ukraine, Andrew, what do you end up learning about the scope of this
*  operation?
*  Clearly, you had just witnessed one place where Ukrainian troops had crossed the border
*  and clearly done a significant amount of damage to the Russian administrative border
*  crossing.
*  But how much territory was involved in this and how many Russian troops were killed or
*  taken?
*  The ultimate scale of the invasion was significant.
*  By some estimates, about 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers were involved.
*  Wow.
*  This one border post was not the only target.
*  They crossed in multiple locations.
*  And once they had breached the border, quickly fanned out on the highways and captured towns
*  and villages.
*  Ultimately, by now occupying about 400 square miles of Russian territory, around 120,000
*  Russian civilians were displaced.
*  More thousands, although we don't know the precise number, are now under Ukrainian occupation.
*  And the fighting has continued, moving both deeper into Russia and also spreading out
*  along the border to widen this area that's under Ukrainian control.
*  What you're describing in no way feels like a gesture or something that's meant to be
*  fleeting, but clearly something longer term, this invasion of Russia.
*  Do you have the sense, Andrew, that this kind of operation at this scale was allowed under
*  the terms of the West's military aid to Ukraine?
*  We've talked a lot about this on the show with you, with our colleagues who cover Russia,
*  that it's been understood that Ukraine could not really use Western military equipment,
*  as it has done here, clearly, to go after Russia itself with very few exceptions.
*  Well, the fact is, Zelensky has said he didn't tell the US in advance of this operation.
*  He didn't ask permission.
*  The Biden administration's policy is to avoid escalation.
*  Russia is a nuclear-armed country, and to allow American missiles, American weapons to be used
*  inside of Russia was a significant step.
*  But once Ukraine launched this operation, this ground invasion of Russia,
*  we heard from the Germans, we heard from the Americans, that this was, in fact,
*  in their assessment within the bounds of using Western weaponry to defend Ukraine.
*  There had been an exception that weapons could be used in the border region
*  for defensive purposes, and this was interpreted in that light.
*  Interesting.
*  Well, with that in mind, what do we know about Ukraine's objective here,
*  its goals for undertaking such a risky invasion of Russia?
*  The Ukrainian government didn't initially articulate any goals, but it's clear there
*  were several layers to this.
*  One was strategic and military.
*  The Ukrainians wanted to strike where Russia was weakest and force Russia to divert its troops
*  and its weapons from inside Ukraine to defending its own territory inside Russia.
*  It was a strategy of taking the war to Russia, and in this way, relieving pressure on their
*  own soldiers who were fighting desperately in eastern Ukraine to hold territory.
*  So basically, to strengthen Ukraine's own hand on the main battlefield,
*  which is Russia and occupied Ukraine.
*  That's right.
*  What else? You said this is multi-motivational.
*  Well, there seemed to be another larger geopolitical goal, and this was a goal to hasten the end of
*  the war. There was a sense that if they were to strike inside of Russia, if they were to
*  capture territory, this would provide leverage in possible peace talks.
*  Right, because for the first time, Ukraine has something that Russia wants, not the other way
*  around.
*  Exactly. And there was also an idea that this could have an effect on public opinion
*  in Russia, that by showing Russians what it's like to be occupied, what it's like to be attacked,
*  Putin could no longer present to his society the operation in Ukraine as something distant
*  and something that would continue even as they live their ordinary lives.
*  Right. We know that Ukraine has pursued that approach before, bringing the pain of this
*  conflict to Russia through sporadic drone attacks on Russian communities, even in Moscow.
*  But this seems by far the most ambitious and successful version of that tactic, a whole
*  other order of magnitude.
*  Exactly. Ukrainians I talked to said that maybe this is what would be needed to end the war,
*  to show Russians what the war was like inside of Ukraine.
*  I spoke with one woman who said that only when the Russians hear what it's like to hear a child
*  crying in a bomb shelter would they want an end to the war.
*  So this was the Ukrainian sentiment. This was a bold military move that would help them
*  in their war. But it's an open question whether this will bring Russia to the bargaining table
*  or just more pain to Ukraine in a Russian retaliation.
*  After the break, Anton Tronovsky brings us the Russian side of the story.

*  And on you cover Russia for the Times, and you have been tracking the Kremlin's response
*  to this large scale invasion by Ukraine. So how has Russia reacted to this, especially once the
*  dust settled, and this sneak attack was more or less over? Well, let's start with the military
*  response. There, it was clear that Russia was completely unprepared for this. Ukraine was able
*  to march miles deep into the country facing minimal resistance and was able to take, it appears,
*  hundreds of Russian soldiers prisoner. In the two weeks since Russia has been able to dispatch
*  forces there, but Russia is not mustering the forces necessary or maybe able or willing to use
*  the firepower necessary to end this quickly. And in the meantime, Ukraine is obviously getting
*  the opportunity to dig in and this is increasingly looking like a longer term occupation of Russian
*  territory by Ukraine. Wow. So this is not the kind of massive military response that you would
*  expect pretty much from any country being invaded, let alone a country as obsessed with its borders
*  as Russia is. Yeah, it's pretty stunning how two weeks in Ukraine controlling Russian territory
*  has already become routine. How does the Russian government explain that reality to the people of
*  Russia that they are for now letting Ukraine occupy all this Russian territory? Well, they're
*  not really trying to explain it, but that does sort of bring us to the kind of political media PR
*  aspect of the Russian response, which has been really to treat this as a natural disaster more
*  than as part of this war. So can you explain that? How are they treating it like a natural disaster?
*  If you turned on the Russian TV news in the days after the invasion started two weeks ago,
*  you were seeing pictures of pallets of water being delivered to displaced people. You were seeing
*  footage of candlelight vigils around the country and people saying things like Kursk,
*  we are with you. But it was not cast as part of or let alone a consequence of Putin's invasion of
*  Ukraine that started in February 2022. So I think the choice has been made so far to just play this
*  down. You know, they're calling it the situation in the Kursk region on Russian TV. So the strategy
*  is kind of self denial. If Russia doesn't treat this like an invasion, it's not an invasion of
*  a little bit reminds us of what Putin has said about invading Ukraine. Yeah, special operation,
*  not a full scale invasion of a neighboring country. Yeah. And remember, Putin is the president
*  of an autocracy in which there is basically no free media at this point. So he does have the
*  luxury, right, to take this kind of tack and does not have to think very much about short term
*  public pressure on his actions. But while Putin hasn't responded forcefully yet, it doesn't mean
*  he isn't planning something or it doesn't mean he won't still respond. Think back to last summer,
*  when the pre-Goshen mutiny march on Moscow happened in June, and two months later,
*  pre-Goshen's plane fell out of the sky in what we believe was a Kremlin assassination. So
*  there could still be a response that comes later, but his non response or slow response so far does
*  remind us of how Putin has in many ways been cautious throughout the last two and a half years
*  to not have this become a wider war. Understood. Given Russia's response so far and understanding
*  that that response may be delayed, how should we think about whether Ukraine is actually achieving
*  its goals for this invasion, diverting Russian troops from Ukraine, who in theory would rush
*  back to protect Russia's borders, drawing Russia into peace talks with Ukraine, and finally bringing
*  the pain of this war as deeply as possible into Russia itself? So the jury is still out on the
*  attempt to draw Russian troops out of eastern Ukraine and over to Kursk. That does not seem to
*  have worked so far. We have reports of some Russian troops leaving, but not really that many. And
*  we are seeing that Russia is still pushing ahead in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. The fight
*  there for the Ukrainians is really tough right now. We're not seeing the Russian pressure let up
*  in eastern Ukraine. And on the contrary, we're actually seeing them taking more of Ukraine.
*  That seems very important because the entire assumption of this invasion would seem to be
*  that Putin's response would have to be to protect Russian territory. So far, that doesn't seem to be
*  his overall imperative. And now you're suggesting that instead he's using it as a chance to push
*  further and further into Ukraine. That would seem like a Ukrainian miscalculation. Right. So we don't
*  know what's going to happen going forward. But for now, that part of the calculation seems to not
*  have come through. But then there's other aspects here. So on pressuring Russia to go into bona fide
*  peace talks with Ukraine, where Russia would be ready to move back from its maximalist aims,
*  there we still have to see. I mean, for the first time, Ukraine is holding Russian territory. And
*  for the first time, you can now imagine a deal in which Ukraine pulls back troops in exchange from
*  Russia pulling back troops. Right. So Ukraine absolutely has a new kind of leverage here. The
*  problem is that Putin is not someone who likes the optics of folding under pressure. But there is one
*  test case that we're watching closely. Our colleagues at the Washington Post have done
*  some good reporting on this. And that is negotiations around both sides committing to
*  not striking each other's energy infrastructure. There was supposed to be a round of talks about
*  this potential deal this month. After the Kursk incursion, Russian officials have said,
*  we don't see a point in negotiating with Ukraine for now. So they're not ruling it out entirely,
*  but they're saying for now, we won't talk. So if this invasion was supposed to represent a
*  potential major breakthrough in the peace talks with Russia, based on the evidence so far, that
*  is not happening. But what about that third prong of Ukraine strategy, inflicting pain on the Russian
*  people in their own country? That seems self evidently to have already happened.
*  Yes, this is really a humiliation for Putin. That's clear. We are seeing yet again, that
*  Russia's vaunted security apparatus has failed in its basic task of maintaining
*  security inside Russia's borders. But at the same time, you have to remember that Ukraine
*  occupies a few hundred square miles of territory right now. That's a very, very small sliver of
*  the Kursk region. And obviously microscopic, if you think about the six plus million square miles
*  that Russia occupies on the globe. So Russians have become more worried, have become more anxious,
*  but it's not a drastic, dramatic shift. Well, Anton, that makes me wonder if there's a universe
*  where Ukraine pushes day after day, bridge after bridge, mile after mile, and starts to take
*  so much Russian territory, that this message gets delivered to all of the people of Russia
*  very, very loudly and in a way that becomes pretty hard to ignore.
*  I mean, so one problem here is that there's another potential response you could see from a
*  public in this kind of situation, which is the rally around the flag effect, right? That as
*  Ukraine pushes forward, more and more Russians might actually become further energized to support
*  Putin's war. We haven't seen a ton of that yet, but that's certainly one other thing to watch.
*  And the other question mark is, at what point do Ukraine's Western allies step in here and try to
*  get the Ukrainians to stop or pull back because they are worried about escalation risk? I think
*  that concern still clearly does exist in Western capitals. The Biden administration obviously so
*  far still hasn't allowed Ukraine to use long range missiles to strike Russian territory beyond
*  the immediate border areas. So we'll have to see about that. But certainly you now hear President
*  Zelensky saying that Putin's lack of response over the last two weeks shows that in Zelensky's words,
*  this whole idea of Russia having red lines that can't be crossed is naive.
*  So it feels like at the moment, two weeks into this invasion, there are two, let's call them fictions,
*  for lack of a better word, guiding how everyone is seeing and responding to this military action by
*  Ukraine. The first is that Putin's acting as if this invasion never really happened at all. And
*  how long can he really keep that up? And for Ukraine, the alleged fiction here is that there
*  really is a red line that they can't cross in bringing this war back to Russia and the Russian
*  people without triggering a wider conflict. So far, Ukraine seems to be saying that that red line
*  doesn't exist and we just proved it. So how should we think about those two fictions together?
*  Well, for one thing, they show how unpredictable this war is. Just like, who could have thought
*  that we would be sitting here in August 2024 talking about a Ukrainian invasion
*  onto Russian territory and talking about Putin doesn't seem to be all that concerned about
*  it. So you're seeing this competition between these two big, almost guiding principles for these
*  two men fighting this war. Putin's constant signaling that he's ready to bear more costs
*  to get what he wants. And Zelensky's showing us that he's willing to take risks and do the unexpected
*  and take the fight to Russia and test what some thought would be Russia's red line.
*  And that just reminds us of how intractable this war is, how two and a half years in,
*  people still don't understand how it ends or when it ends. Perhaps the invasion brings us closer
*  to that or perhaps it extends it even more. Well, Anton, thank you very much. Thank you, Michael.
