# Ukraine’s Counteroffensive Fizzled. U.S. Funding May Be Next.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zf-wbfZYmA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky, has made a rare trip to Washington this week,
*  pleading his case for American military aid, long a lifeline for his country, but now increasingly
*  in doubt.
*  Today, my colleague Julian Barnes, on what has brought Ukraine to its most perilous point
*  since the war began nearly two years ago.
*  It's Tuesday, December 12th.
*  So, Julian, you've been following the war in Ukraine, which is kind of the other war
*  that's been happening in the world.
*  And today we're going to talk about how that war has not only continued, but really has
*  reached a critical point, one in which the United States plays a very important role.
*  So tell me what's happening.
*  This is a real important moment for Ukraine.
*  It might be the most dangerous since the war first began.
*  And there's a reason for that.
*  Mr. President, the question before the Senate today is simple, yet momentous.
*  The American funding for Ukraine hangs in the balance.
*  At stake is America's safety, the safety of democracy, the future of the war in Ukraine.
*  Last week, there was an important Senate vote that would have provided $50 billion more
*  for Ukraine.
*  This would have taken them through next year.
*  My Democratic colleagues support security for Ukraine, but what they won't support
*  is basic border security for the United States of America.
*  The Republican opposition to this is growing.
*  There will never be a bill I'll vote for to help other countries who are very deserving
*  until we control our own border that's completely broken.
*  There are lawmakers who want to spend the money at home, not in an overseas war that
*  they think is going badly.
*  Mr. Sullivan, no.
*  Mr. Paul, no.
*  Ms. Murkowski, no.
*  But it failed.
*  On this vote, the yeas are 49, the nays are 51.
*  It failed by a single vote.
*  The motion is not agreed to.
*  The Senate stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow.
*  If this funding does not come through, Ukraine will lose the war.
*  And we can see how grave those stakes are because today, President Zelensky of Ukraine
*  is in Washington making the case for more money, making the case for continued U.S.
*  support.
*  So, Julian, let's unpack this here.
*  Let's talk about where we actually are in the war right now.
*  We left off back in June when we did an episode about the much-vaunted counteroffense that
*  the Ukrainians were undertaking.
*  And the Ukrainians were trying to prove that they could actually go on the offensive, take
*  territory, not just defend it from the Russians.
*  And perhaps just as important, they were trying to prove to their Western allies, like the
*  United States, that the money that those allies were pouring into the war was not in vain.
*  Remind us what Zelensky said he needed at the time.
*  So the U.S. has provided upwards of $75 billion in military and economic aid to Ukraine.
*  And a good chunk of that was what came this year when the U.S. provided armored striker
*  vehicles, Bradley fighting vehicles, these high Mars rocket artillery that could go deep
*  behind Russian lines, that when combined with European tanks from Germany and the United
*  Kingdom were going to be the backbone of something big.
*  In addition to the equipment, there became this weeks-long effort to use the equipment.
*  We were training 36,000 Ukrainian soldiers in order to make a dramatic new push to push
*  back Russian forces.
*  So he got all of these weapons and all of this U.S. training, and the counteroffensive
*  finally began around early last summer.
*  And now, six months later, what's the answer?
*  What happened?
*  Well, it failed.
*  The counteroffensive failed to achieve the key objectives that Ukraine had laid out,
*  that the U.S. had laid out.
*  It did not take back major territory that Russia had conquered.
*  Russia still today occupies nearly 20% of Ukraine's territory.
*  And why did it fail?
*  Why did this effort to really seize back all of this territory that Russia won in the early
*  months of the war fall flat?
*  Well, one reason was the Ukrainian troops were stretched too thin.
*  The Americans really wanted Ukraine to focus their forces in one area, to put massive amounts
*  of force in a single location in order to have a dramatic breakthrough.
*  But the Ukrainians spread it out along a long battle line.
*  And that just meant that for too long, there were too few Ukrainian forces.
*  Okay, so Ukraine was stretched all over the country, fighting on multiple fronts, instead
*  of focused just in one place, on one key crucial front that the United States was arguing it
*  should be doing.
*  What else was going on?
*  Well, Russia also got better.
*  Now, remember, it's easier to be on the defense than on the offense in a war.
*  And so Russia had that advantage.
*  But they'd also learn from some of their mistakes.
*  And they really focused on improving their defenses.
*  And they built these layers of defense, these trench lines where they could keep their troops.
*  And in between, they put mine upon mine.
*  We had some of the thickest land mines we've seen since the Korean War.
*  It proved to be an impenetrable defense.
*  And then they combined that old technology with a new one.
*  In the air, they put thousands of drones.
*  And those drones could spot any movement by the Ukrainians.
*  As the Ukrainians came to move across a minefield, the Russians would move their forces and they
*  would engage.
*  It kind of lifted the fog of war.
*  And the Russians were able to react much more quickly than the Americans or the Ukrainians
*  thought they would.
*  So suddenly, the Russians had these kind of x-ray glasses, right?
*  They could see everything the Ukrainians were doing at any given moment because they had
*  all of these drones flying up in the air, which I'm assuming, Julian, weren't super
*  specialized attack things.
*  They were just regular kind of out of the box drones.
*  Yeah, these are incredibly simple drones, the same thing that you can purchase from
*  your favorite big box store.
*  But the important thing is the Ukrainians weren't trained on how to fight a war against
*  a thousand cheap drones in the sky.
*  We were training them on an older kind of warfare that it turns out was outmoded.
*  And look, the US for years has tried to train up partner forces in its own image.
*  Think about Iraq, Afghanistan, even think about Vietnam.
*  And here, the US said, we are going to teach you, Ukraine, the basics of what the US calls
*  maneuver warfare, how to use tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery to have a big
*  effect on the battlefield.
*  But the Ukrainians aren't the US.
*  They didn't have all the equipment.
*  Most importantly, they didn't have an air force.
*  When the US brings out its tanks, it also has airplanes in the sky protecting those
*  tanks.
*  And Ukraine didn't have that.
*  So this all seems to go back to the notion that we had at the very beginning of this
*  war, which is, if you're a little country, how do you go up against one of the world's
*  biggest armies and win?
*  Moreover, one of the world's biggest armies in a country run by an autocrat who is okay
*  with having a lot of casualties because for the most part, he probably doesn't have to
*  pay a political price for that.
*  That's right.
*  Russia has a seemingly endless supply of soldiers.
*  They've pushed in these wave attacks that they've taken massive casualties with little
*  repercussions to Putin back at home.
*  That's a very hard thing to go up against.
*  And the US argued that in a moment of existential crisis, Ukraine had no choice but to be willing
*  to take more casualties, even if thousands of people were killed, even if hundreds of
*  pieces of equipment were lost.
*  But President Zelensky pushed back.
*  He said, you're asking me to take 50% casualty rates, even more.
*  This is not something any democratic government would do.
*  The US would face real repercussions if they had a military operation that half of the
*  soldiers were lost in.
*  So it became a political as well as a military problem.
*  Which brings us to today.
*  The counteroffensive has failed for the most part, which means that the US and other allies
*  have poured billions of dollars into Ukraine over the course of the past two years.
*  And it didn't work.
*  Which must be pretty galling for parts of the US political system, which are not very
*  enthusiastic about funding the thing to begin with.
*  So what does all of this mean for Ukraine vis-a-vis the funding?
*  Nothing good.
*  Who wants to put money into a failing effort?
*  Who wants to toss good money after wasted money?
*  So the big question is, how are the Ukrainians going to adapt their war strategy?
*  And will it be enough to convince the United States and its allies that Ukraine can win
*  and can turn the tide back in their favor?
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, so Julian, you've just explained all the ways in which the counteroffensive went
*  wrong.
*  And you're saying that now the question is, will Ukraine adapt?
*  Can it retool what it's been doing?
*  What are the options before Ukraine on the table here?
*  What could they do to get back on track?
*  So what American strategists are pushing is this idea of hold and build.
*  And that means don't go on the offensive, but to spend the next year rebuilding its
*  forces, resting its forces.
*  You'd rotate some of the troops off the front lines.
*  They've been there for two years fighting.
*  Ukraine would rebuild its own capacity to build weapons, artillery shells, missiles,
*  and be ready for a future offensive at the end of 2024 or even 2025.
*  So in other words, kind of conserve your energy, forget about trying to do some major land
*  grab, just stay put and plan for something bigger in the future.
*  But what does that actually get them?
*  I mean, wars are not won by going on the defensive, right?
*  The Ukrainians are keenly aware of that.
*  And this is the reason they have been pushing back against the American strategy.
*  They know that they need to do something dramatic to change the conversation about the war,
*  to change the perception that they are losing.
*  So another option is for Ukraine to double down on the things that they are good at.
*  And so that could be black ops going behind enemy lines.
*  We have seen the Ukrainians do these raids into Crimea, these strikes with long range
*  missiles into the Russian Black Sea fleet.
*  We've had the first country without a navy to win a major naval battle against the Russian
*  Black Sea fleet just through these kind of crafty covert operations.
*  They have proven adept at this.
*  They've proven very creative.
*  But some folks think that's not enough.
*  That if they're going to show the world that they can win, if they're going to show America
*  that they deserve new funding, they need to do something dramatic and flashy.
*  That could be something like attacking the Kirch Bridge, which goes between Russia and
*  Crimea.
*  The Kirch Bridge is the way the Russians supply Crimea, one of their most important military
*  hubs.
*  The Ukrainians have attacked it before, but some people are saying they need to bring
*  the whole thing down to destroy this project that Vladimir Putin put billions into.
*  As you say, spectacular, flashy.
*  Right.
*  And there are other ideas as well.
*  They could try to go where the Russians are not.
*  The Ukrainians could try to go into Russia.
*  Look, last year, Yevgeny Progozhin marched his army halfway through Moscow and was barely
*  opposed.
*  Indeed, the Russian commander who kind of went rogue and decided to take his troops
*  to Moscow because he wasn't happy about military policy.
*  That was dramatic.
*  Certainly everybody noticed.
*  And showed some Russian weakness.
*  There were a lot of patches of undefended Russian territory.
*  Now, there's all kinds of reasons the Ukrainians shouldn't do that.
*  That could escalate this fight quickly.
*  On the other hand, it would really lay out the cost to Moscow.
*  It would really show the Americans what the Ukrainians are capable of.
*  Could escalate the fight quickly, even potentially to a nuclear one.
*  This was the whole reason why the US didn't want the Ukrainians trying to go into Russia,
*  right?
*  That's right.
*  Russian officials have been very clear that their doctrine is they use nuclear weapons
*  When their territory is threatened, Ukrainian army marching into Russia would cross that
*  line.
*  Okay, so just to summarize here, the other option in front of the Ukrainians is to do
*  what they're good at, which is small black ops operations kind of behind enemy lines
*  type stuff.
*  But that also seems kind of tricky.
*  I mean, that's not going to turn the tide of the war more broadly in their favor, right?
*  We're critically going to convince Ukraine's Western allies to open up their wallets.
*  And Ukraine does need to make that case.
*  Look, they're already running out of ammunition.
*  Supplies are already growing short.
*  Now, the Pentagon says Ukraine has enough supplies to last another four to five months.
*  But eventually, those supplies, that equipment is going to need to be replenished.
*  They're going to need to make the case to the United States for more funding.
*  Which is presumably why Zelensky is in Washington as we speak.
*  Okay, so Julian, do you think that, you know, at the end of the day, this funding will actually
*  happen?
*  Like, what's your gut on this?
*  The most important person in the American political system.
*  Good afternoon, everyone.
*  I'd like to speak to you today is the president.
*  Ukraine just needs to pass supplemental funding for Ukraine before they break for the holiday
*  resources.
*  Simple as that.
*  Frankly, I think it's stunning that we've gotten to this point in the first place.
*  And he seems willing to break the impasse.
*  This is too serious.
*  Like I said, I am willing to make significant compromises on the border.
*  We need to fix the broken border system.
*  It is broken.
*  He said it in his speech last week.
*  He made it very plain that he is ready to negotiate.
*  Let's get this done.
*  We're the reason Putin has not totally overrun Ukraine and move beyond that.
*  President Biden has really made the war in Ukraine his war.
*  He is extraordinarily motivated to get this approved.
*  That willingness to make a deal on border security on Republican priorities will make
*  a difference.
*  Now, look, some of my colleagues may disagree, but I think there's a good chance this gets
*  through.
*  We may go into the next calendar year.
*  It may happen in January or even February.
*  But I believe there will eventually be a deal and the United States will give Ukraine funding
*  for next year.
*  But it sounds like even if you're right, and our colleagues are wrong, even if it does
*  happen early next year, that that's probably about it for funding, right?
*  I mean, the US is about to enter a presidential election season.
*  Funding will become much more difficult as the months go on.
*  So I guess, Julian, the question in my mind is, are we entering the chapter in the history
*  books whose title would be When the West Abandoned Ukraine?
*  Look, if Ukraine comes up with a new strategy, if the US continues funding at some level,
*  there is hope.
*  Ukraine is not going to get the same level of funding that they've had for the first
*  two years of war.
*  Even a war on a budget is a war that could be won.
*  But is it though?
*  I mean, the whole critique of how the West was funding Ukraine was that the West was
*  giving Ukraine just enough funding so that it did not lose, but not enough funding so
*  that it actually could win.
*  Look, after two years of war, it now seems like it's going to be very difficult for Ukraine
*  to push the Russians completely out.
*  We're not going to go back to the 2014 lines.
*  As we said, if the war stopped today, that's 20% of Ukraine that is gone.
*  With a new approach, maybe some of that land could be taken.
*  Or at the very least, Russia would be in a worse position and Ukraine would be in a better
*  position when diplomatic talks inevitably restart, the diplomatic talks that will be
*  necessary to ultimately end the fighting.
*  In other words, this isn't about absolutes.
*  It's not like Ukraine would suddenly completely win the war and push the Russians out entirely.
*  This is about putting Ukraine in a better position at the inevitable bargaining table
*  that of course happens at the end of every war with Putin.
*  What is he thinking as he sees all of this play out?
*  From the Russian perspective, what is happening is just what they wanted.
*  Vladimir Putin's strategy was to outlast the West.
*  The funding debate, the election debate has given him reason to believe his strategy is
*  working, that the US is getting tired of supporting Ukraine.
*  Putin has always argued Ukraine is more important to him than it is to the West.
*  And he has said, being patient, being strategic will win him this war.
*  In some ways, this entire funding debate is about whether or not Putin's theory of the
*  case is correct.
*  And in the weeks to come, we are going to get that answer.
*  Julian, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  On Monday, the Russian military delivered one of the most intense missile bombardments
*  against Ukraine's capital in months.
*  The strike came one day after a video circulated of Putin sipping champagne at an awards ceremony
*  in Moscow and talking about waning Western support for Kiev.
*  Ukraine, he said, had, quote, no future.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Meanwhile, in Washington, Putin must lose.
*  Putin must lose.
*  Meanwhile, in Washington, President Zelensky gave a speech ahead of his meeting with President
*  Biden, which is scheduled for Tuesday.
*  When the free world hesitates, that's when dictatorships celebrate.
*  Zelensky said, quote, when the free world hesitates, that's when dictatorships celebrate.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else to know today.
*  On Monday, Jack Smith, the special counsel prosecuting former President Donald Trump
*  on charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election, asked the Supreme Court to rule
*  on Trump's argument that, as a former president, he is immune from prosecution.
*  Two weeks ago, the trial judge presiding over Trump's case, one of the many prosecutions
*  he now faces, rejected the former president's sweeping claims that he enjoyed, quote, absolute
*  immunity because the case was based on actions he took while still in office.
*  Trump appealed the judge's decision, leading to Smith's move on Monday, which is an effort
*  to keep the proceedings on track.
*  The trial is scheduled to begin on March 4th, and any significant delay could push
*  it past the 2024 election when Trump could order that the charges be dropped if he wins
*  the presidency.
