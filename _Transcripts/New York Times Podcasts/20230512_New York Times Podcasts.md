*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavarnese, and this is The Daily.
*  This is finished, I thought a productive meeting with a Congressal leadership about the path
*  forward to make sure America does not default.
*  In a high stake showdown this week, President Biden and the leaders of Congress met face-to-face.
*  In an attempt to avoid the U.S. defaulting on its debt for the first time in history.
*  America is not a deadbeat nation.
*  We pay our bills and avoiding default is a basic duty of the United States Congress.
*  Today, my colleague Jim Tangerously, on how close the country now is to that financial
*  calamity and the radical step Biden might take to prevent it.
*  It's Friday, May 12th.
*  So Jim, the federal government, as we all know, is in this rather frantic process of trying
*  to avoid the nation defaulting on its debts.
*  And we talked on the show last week about how that poses this really big challenge for
*  the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.
*  But of course, it also poses a really big challenge for President Biden.
*  So walk me through the debt limit dilemma from his point of view.
*  What does this look like if you're Biden?
*  So on Tuesday, President Biden welcomed Speaker McCarthy and other congressional leaders from
*  both parties to the White House.
*  And for all intents and purposes, this really was a negotiation.
*  The timing of these talks has everything to do with what's going on right now with the
*  debt limit.
*  From the president's perspective, what's happening here is that Republicans are holding the
*  nation hostage.
*  They're basically saying we might let the government default on debt catastrophically for the economy
*  unless President Biden agrees to a whole bunch of cuts in federal spending.
*  The president has no intention of agreeing to the wide scope of cuts Republicans have talked
*  about.
*  And he's really opposed to the idea that he should have to negotiate it all over what
*  he basically views as Congress's responsibility to raise the limit to pay the bills Congress
*  has already authorized.
*  Got it.
*  Now, from Republicans' perspective, Biden's being unreasonable.
*  They have passed a bill that raises the debt limit.
*  And even though it comes with strings that he doesn't like attached to it, that should
*  be reason for him to sit down and say, okay, what can we agree on here?
*  Right.
*  So all of that in mind, the parties come to the White House on Tuesday afternoon.
*  They sit down and there's real urgency behind the talks because we are barreling toward
*  what is known as the X state.
*  It's the time when the Treasury Department is going to run out of its ability to pay all
*  of the government's bills on time.
*  And Treasury officials have recently estimated that date could hit as soon as June 1st.
*  Which is really suit.
*  Yeah, it's basically no time at all.
*  But so far on their talks, the President and Republicans of Congress have made almost
*  no progress in finding common ground.
*  They're sort of stocking a game of chicken with each one kind of pointing the finger at
*  the other and expecting that they will blink first, give in to the other side's demands
*  to avoid a default.
*  And that's a really perilous position for the economy and the country right now.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  So basically up until this point, things have been kind of at a stalemate between the two
*  sides.
*  What can Biden do about it?
*  Well, the first is that he could put an end to that game of chicken and attempt to negotiate
*  a deal with Speaker McCarthy that would be acceptable to both the Speaker and the President.
*  And probably what that would mean is some sort of agreement built around some kind of limits
*  on federal discretionary spending over a period of a few years.
*  There's a reason in particular that White House official talk about spending limits as a
*  possible anchor of a deal.
*  And it's because they don't expect to increase spending anyway, so long as Republicans control
*  the House.
*  So if they just effectively agreed to put into writing what they expect to happen already,
*  well, the President might go for that.
*  Right.
*  And that though, the President signaled on Tuesday that he might be willing to cut some
*  spending in a way that Republicans have been pushing for for a while.
*  Specifically, he would be open to canceling some of the money that was included in the stimulus
*  bill he signed in 2021, but hasn't been spent yet.
*  Now Republicans estimate that cancellation would save $50 to $70 billion.
*  But that's a really small slice of their total proposal to raise the debt limiting
*  cut spending, which actually sums up to nearly $5 trillion.
*  Okay.
*  So in this option, Biden would say, look, I'll agree to a more moderate set of spending
*  cuts.
*  And in return, Speaker McCarthy, you'll go ahead and raise the debt limit no strings attached.
*  That's certainly one of the things that a lot of folks around Washington expect could be
*  an outcome of these discussions.
*  It's not clear that would work.
*  Speaker McCarthy would have to sell that compromise to Republicans in the House.
*  And there are a lot of them who have really been agitating for much, much deeper cuts than
*  any kind of deal with the President would entail and who could very likely refuse to vote
*  for it.
*  Right.
*  So big potential pitfalls to that one.
*  So what's the next option then?
*  Well, if the President decides that it's just not fruitful to talk to the Speaker, he
*  could try to go around Kevin McCarthy.
*  He could try to cut a deal with just enough Republican votes to join with Democrats in
*  the House and the Senate to raise the debt limit.
*  That would require doing something to bring probably five Republicans in the House on board
*  and close to 10 Republicans in the Senate.
*  They'd have to probably use this legislative maneuver called a discharge petition.
*  Oh, boy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a way to bring a bill to the floor for a vote in the House, even if the Speaker
*  of the House doesn't want it there.
*  So theoretically, they could do this arcane process to bring up a bill that they have a small
*  number of Republicans agreeing on to pass a debt limit increase with mostly Democratic
*  votes.
*  It's really tricky.
*  It takes a lot of time, legislatively.
*  It takes a lot of political capital and there's no indication that the sort of discussions
*  are going on with Republicans or that there's even an appetite among Republicans to make
*  this happen.
*  Got it.
*  So these options don't look particularly easy, either get Republicans to agree to way
*  less than what they're asking for or convince enough Republicans to turn their back on their
*  party.
*  Well, yeah, none of the legislative options are perfect.
*  It's true.
*  And it is what's giving a lot of heartburn to people who watch Congress right now, is
*  that they're having a hard time seeing how it would work.
*  But there is another option that the administration is weighing.
*  It's actually something that they've been talking about for months that is still on the
*  table today and would be, I wouldn't call it a nuclear option, but a really big bold
*  risk that the president could take to try to end this debt limit fight by himself.
*  And what's that option?
*  The president could decide to ignore Congress and ignore the debt limit.
*  He could follow a theory of the Constitution that is effectively a constitutional challenge
*  to the existence of the debt limit itself.
*  It's rooted in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which effectively says the government
*  has to pay its debts.
*  You can't just not pay.
*  But the 14th Amendment, like the 14th Amendment?
*  Yeah, that's 14th Amendment.
*  I mean, that was the amendment that was passed after the Civil War and it was about slavery
*  it, right?
*  Yeah.
*  So what does it have to do with the nation's debt?
*  Okay, it's wonky, but bear with me here.
*  Okay.
*  As you just said, the 14th Amendment is adopted right after the Civil War at a time when
*  lawmakers are setting out the terms under which the states that had seceded to join the
*  Confederacy would be allowed to come back into the Union.
*  It does a lot of stuff.
*  It granted citizenship to former slaves, for example, but it also includes a section, section
*  four, if you're scoring it at home, that says the validity of the public debt of the United
*  States shall not be questioned.
*  And there's sort of a quirky reason why they did that.
*  It was about sort of the fears of Southern states' regaining political power in a new Congress.
*  You know, the United States had borrowed money to finance the Union Army in the Civil
*  War and there was a worry that if Southern senators and representatives controlled Congress,
*  they could just decide, oh, we're not going to pay the people we borrowed money from for
*  a war against our own states.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  So they wanted to make sure that in the Constitution, it said, nope, you have to pay all the debt.
*  Got it.
*  So they were coming back in having political representation in Congress and the idea was,
*  you know, you have to accept and take on all of the debts you can't back out of them.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So under that theory, a president, like President Biden, could decide that the Constitution
*  trumps the law and that in this case, it requires the government to keep issuing new debt
*  to pay off its old debts no matter what the debt limit says.
*  So this clause has been around for a long time, right, since the 19th century.
*  Why have another president who faced this problem used it?
*  It has been around and this is not the first time it's come up.
*  It was raised in like a law review article at the end of the 90s, but it really kind of
*  entered the conversation from obscurity in 2011.
*  After seven plus months of scathing political attacks, countless meetings between the president
*  and lawmakers, there is still no debt ceiling deal.
*  When President Obama had that debt ceiling fight with Republicans in the House, some top
*  tier Democrats have said, hmm, the 14th Amendment, that might work for us, maybe the...
*  At the time, there was a lot of buzz about it.
*  I'm hearing people talk a little bit more about the feasibility of this 14th Amendment
*  option.
*  Even former President Bill Clinton said that he would have invoked the amendment if he
*  was still president.
*  There's a strong argument for it, Bill Clinton has argued.
*  But inside the Obama White House, I have talked to my lawyers.
*  They don't... they do not... they are not persuaded that that is a winning argument.
*  They never really seriously consider this.
*  And why didn't they consider it seriously?
*  Well, first off, it's not clear cut in the Constitution.
*  The Constitution also says that taxing and spending resides with Congress.
*  So it's a theory, and it's a theory that has some scholarship behind it, but it's not
*  a cut and dry.
*  Everyone agrees on it interpretation of the Constitution.
*  But beyond that, there were other considerations driving the Obama team when they didn't consider
*  this, and that are giving the Biden team pause now.
*  And the biggest one is this, even if a president were to believe that this is constitutional
*  and the right thing to do and take this leap, that leap would bring some really profound
*  consequences.
*  We'll be right back.
*  OK, so Jim, walk me through what the consequences would be if the Biden administration actually decides
*  to go for this thing, the Fourteenth Amendment strategy.
*  Well, first off, we don't know exactly what would happen, but I don't think it would be
*  that the president would step outside the White House one day and run out and scream into
*  the void.
*  I invoke the Fourteenth Amendment.
*  Oh, no.
*  But I mean, unlikely.
*  Possibly.
*  Good television.
*  I don't think so.
*  But as the June 1st deadline approaches, the government runs out of the ability to pay
*  its bills.
*  So the president will essentially say, OK, I'm going to call the Treasury Secretary and tell
*  her that we are invoking the Fourteenth Amendment.
*  And so we need to have another round of raising money to pay our debts.
*  Like Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary, can just do that.
*  Well, her department holds what's called a Treasury auction.
*  Happens all the time and it's when the government goes out and sells new bonds to lenders who
*  are essentially giving the government money now in exchange for the government giving them
*  some more money later on down the road.
*  So Biden calling up Yellen says, just do another Treasury auction.
*  We do them every week.
*  Do one this week.
*  Like that sounds OK, right?
*  Like where's the problem there?
*  Well, the problem is in the auction itself and it's specifically with the buyers of the
*  government bonds.
*  They, for good reason, might not be so sure that this debt they would be borrowing is actually
*  going to pay off down the road.
*  If there's a constitutional question about whether the government will actually be allowed
*  to issue these bonds, well, then maybe you're buying something that's worthless.
*  So those buyers in the Treasury auction are going to do what buyers in auctions do all
*  the time when they're buying a riskier asset, which is they're going to pay less money for
*  it.
*  And what effectively does that mean?
*  Effectively what it means is that the government is going to have to pay a much higher interest
*  rate to borrow money in the short term.
*  It's kind of like taking out a payday loan with a really high rate.
*  What would the financial fallout here be worse than if the government just defaulted on
*  its debt altogether?
*  Probably not.
*  I mean, that is a big part of the consideration here.
*  I mean, this would be chaos.
*  An actual default on the debt could be crippling chaos.
*  If the debt limit is hit and we truly breach the X state, the markets are going to go nuts
*  no matter what Biden does and not just Treasury markets.
*  But in this case, what's going to happen is the government is going to at least keep
*  that money flowing into the economy, which will be less of a disruption than if it just
*  stopped paying people.
*  And the trade off is it's going to be paying a really high interest rate to borrow that
*  money to keep flowing.
*  So these are the financial perils.
*  But I mean, there must be some pretty serious legal consequences here too, right?
*  I mean, Biden is essentially circumventing Congress.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I mean, it is basically a guarantee that someone would challenge this in court if Biden
*  did it.
*  But what that look like?
*  Well, there's a real chance that some lower court somewhere in the country would decide
*  that in fact, the government can't do this, that the Constitution does not say what Biden
*  is saying and that the Constitution vests power for taxing and spending only with Congress
*  and the Biden administration would appeal.
*  And it would very likely end up at the United States Supreme Court because, you know, that
*  is how these big fights seem to end up these days.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So what does this Supreme Court then want?
*  Well, Supreme Court could decide any number of things.
*  On the one hand, they could decide that the plaintiff is correct, that the government
*  cannot issue any more debt.
*  And it might say that debt is invalid, that was just issued in the Treasury auction, or
*  that the government has to give the buyers their money back.
*  So that would then cause the default that the administration had been trying to avoid.
*  All the government spending would come to a halt, pretty dire economic situation.
*  And presumably what those bond buyers were worried about, right?
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  On the other hand, the Supreme Court could side with Biden.
*  And that could happen in actually a couple of different ways.
*  For one, it could decide that no one has standing to sue to challenge Biden's move because
*  you need to show harm in order to be a plaintiff in a case like this.
*  And the court could decide that, well, no one is harmed by the government continuing to
*  issue debt.
*  The second thing you could do, of course, is just agree with this interpretation of
*  the Constitution.
*  It could say the president is correct, the 14th Amendment overrides the law, and the government
*  must keep paying its debts.
*  In either of those scenarios, it would effectively be agreeing with Biden that the debt limit
*  is unconstitutional and basically strike it down.
*  So in that scenario, I mean, if the administration did move forward with this constitutional strategy
*  and it worked as you're describing there, it would mean the end of these debt limit fights
*  altogether, right?
*  Which would seem to be a bit of a political earthquake.
*  It would be.
*  It would be a political earthquake.
*  It's certainly something that a lot of Democrats and progressives who have pushed this interpretation
*  of the Constitution for a long time would love to see.
*  They would call it an end to the Republican hostage taking over the debt limit.
*  In terms of the Trump term, however, it would be a really big mess for the operations of
*  this Congress and this government into this president.
*  Describe that mess.
*  Well, very bluntly put, it would make Republicans really angry.
*  And they could retaliate in a number of ways.
*  One of the easiest ways they could retaliate is by deciding, hey, the money that funds all
*  of the government services that people know and use runs out at the end of September.
*  And we're just not going to pass a bill appropriate any more money until Biden reverses course
*  on the debt limit.
*  So essentially, even if Janet Yellen is out there raising money, having these debt
*  auctions, there are ways that Congress can still throw some pretty serious hurdles in
*  the way of the government's finances.
*  Yeah, Congress has to appropriate the money to run basic government operations.
*  Now, everything from the military to the education department to the national parks, and they
*  could just decide in protest not to do that for a while or indefinitely until the president
*  comes to the table and meets their demands.
*  So even if Biden does this, you know, and it goes okay, or at the very least it doesn't blow
*  up completely, it's still pretty politically risky for him.
*  Yeah, this is a political consideration that has been discussed inside the administration.
*  And that risk extends well beyond Congress.
*  I mean, I think it's very fair to say that we have no idea what public opinion would be
*  about this.
*  It's certainly not something that's been debated in the open, it hasn't been aired in campaign
*  commercials.
*  You know, the president is just starting to run for re-election and he'd be taking a
*  risk here, hoping that voters would reward him for acting decisively to keep the nation
*  from defaulting, but worrying that voters might get angry about it and often when voters
*  are angry, they blame the president.
*  So that's a risk for him as well.
*  So Jim, big picture here.
*  How likely is it that this 14th Amendment strategy actually gets used by the Biden administration?
*  I mean, given these risks, you're laying out.
*  Well, something really interesting on this happened on Tuesday.
*  After his meeting with congressional leaders, the nation has never de-followed his debt,
*  it never will.
*  President Biden gave a statement, and then took questions from reporters, and he was asked
*  if he would consider invoking the 14th Amendment.
*  Well, the question I have been considering the 14th Amendment.
*  He said he was looking at it, but the problem is it would have to be litigated.
*  He mentioned the legal reasons why it might not be a great idea, but he explicitly kept
*  it on the table.
*  There have been discussions about whether the 14th Amendment can be removed.
*  Is that the most likely?
*  I think that's important.
*  I think it certainly makes it much more likely that it could happen than people thought weeks
*  ago when the president is refusing to rule it out in public in the midst of these talks
*  with Republicans.
*  Interesting.
*  Now, with all that said, I think there's still a decent chance that whether it's through
*  negotiation or a steering contest or whatever, the president and Congress end with an agreement
*  to raise the debt limit before we hit the X-Tate.
*  That could mean kicking the can down the road just a little bit, a month or two to give
*  them more time to talk about the debt limit.
*  There's always this possibility that financial markets will freak out right before a possible
*  default, and that that could spur Congress to act.
*  Regardless of whether Biden actually pulls the trigger on the 14th Amendment idea, isn't
*  the fact that it's become such a point of conversation kind of meaningful in and of
*  itself?
*  Like we've gotten to this point that this option is on the table.
*  I mean, what does that tell us about where we are right now as a country, as a political
*  system?
*  I actually had an interview this week with someone who has been around Washington for a long
*  time and was talking to me on background about this crisis.
*  What he said was, I think, very resonant to this question, which was no one trusts each
*  other in Washington like they used to.
*  Right.
*  Inside the Biden administration, they do not trust that Republicans are actually going to raise
*  the debt limit in time in the same way that the Obama administration trusted that.
*  And Republicans don't trust that Biden won't circumvent them, so it's almost self-reinforcing.
*  That lack of trust reflects a divided electorate and angry electorate people turning against
*  each other in this country.
*  And I think it has made even routine things like raising a debt limit, not at all routine.
*  And the president has sort of had enough of this.
*  He led the negotiations in 2011 to resolve the debt limit standoff.
*  And this time, he's just done with it.
*  He doesn't want to be negotiating over the debt limit.
*  He does not see it as appropriate.
*  He sees it as hostage taking.
*  And so for all those reasons, this does not feel the same as those previous fights to me.
*  And that raises the possibility that it could end differently.
*  Jim, thank you.
*  Thank you so much.
*  President Biden, Speaker McCarthy and other congressional leaders were scheduled to meet
*  at the White House again this afternoon to continue their negotiations over the debt
*  limit.
*  But on Thursday, the White House announced that that meeting had been postponed.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Thursday, Manhattan prosecutors said that they would bring criminal charges against
*  Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old Marine veteran who choked and killed a homeless man on the
*  subway.
*  The District Attorney's Office said he would charge Penny with second-degree manslaughter
*  in the killing of Jordan Neely on an F-Train on May 1st.
*  Penny is expected to appear in Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday.
*  And the Food and Drug Administration announced that it has formally ended a longstanding policy
*  of not accepting blood donations from gay and bisexual men.
*  Instead, the agency is finalizing new guidance that will require all blood donors to fill
*  out a questionnaire about their recent sexual activity.
*  The change effectively ends a federal policy that had long been considered discriminatory.
