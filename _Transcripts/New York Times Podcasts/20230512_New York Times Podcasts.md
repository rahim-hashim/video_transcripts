# Bidenâ€™s Radical Option to End the Debt Fight
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub_z7Vxw2P4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  In a high-stakes showdown this week, President Biden and the leaders of Congress met face
*  in an attempt to avoid the U.S. defaulting on its debt for the first time in history.
*  America is not a deadbeat nation. We pay our bills, and avoiding default is a basic duty
*  of the United States Congress.
*  Today, my colleague Jim Tangrissly on how close the country now is to that financial
*  calamity and the radical step Biden might take to prevent it.
*  It's Friday, May 12th.
*  So Jim, the federal government, as we all know, is in this rather frantic process of
*  trying to avoid the nation defaulting on its debts. And we talked on the show last week
*  about how that poses this really big challenge for the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.
*  But of course, it also poses a really big challenge for President Biden.
*  So walk me through the debt limit dilemma from his point of view.
*  What does this look like if you're Biden?
*  So on Tuesday, President Biden welcomed Speaker McCarthy and other congressional leaders from
*  both parties to the White House. And for all intents and purposes, this really was a negotiation.
*  The timing of these talks has everything to do with what's going on right now with the debt
*  limit. From the president's perspective, what's happening here is that Republicans are holding
*  the nation hostage. They're basically saying we might let the government default on debt
*  catastrophically for the economy unless President Biden agrees to a whole bunch of cuts in federal
*  spending. The president has no intention of agreeing to the wide scope of cuts Republicans
*  have talked about. And he's really opposed to the idea that he should have to negotiate it all
*  over what he basically views as Congress's responsibility to raise the limit to pay the
*  bills Congress has already authorized. Got it.
*  Now, from Republicans perspective, Biden's being unreasonable. They have passed a bill that raises
*  the debt limit. And even though it comes with strings that he doesn't like attached to it,
*  that should be reason for him to sit down and say, okay, what can we agree on here?
*  Right. So all of that in mind,
*  the parties come to the White House on Tuesday afternoon, they sit down, and there's real urgency
*  behind the talks because we are barreling toward what is known as the X date. It's the time when
*  the Treasury Department is going to run out of its ability to pay all of the government's bills on
*  time. And Treasury officials have recently estimated that date could hit as soon as June 1st.
*  Which is really soon. Yeah, it's basically no time at all.
*  But so far in their talks, the President and Republicans of Congress have made almost no
*  progress in finding common ground. They're sort of stuck in a game of chicken with each one kind
*  of pointing the finger at the other and expecting that they will blink first, give into the other
*  side's demands to avoid a default. And that's a really perilous position for the economy and
*  the country right now. Right. Okay. So basically,
*  up until this point, things have been kind of at a stalemate between the two sides.
*  What can Biden do about it? Well, the first is that he could
*  put an end to that game of chicken and attempt to negotiate a deal with Speaker McCarthy that would
*  be acceptable to both the Speaker and to the President. And probably what that would mean
*  is some sort of agreement built around some kind of limits on federal discretionary spending
*  over a period of a few years. There's a reason in particular that White House officials talk about
*  spending limits as a possible anchor of a deal. And it's because they don't expect to increase
*  spending anyway, so long as Republicans control the House. So if they just effectively agree to
*  put into writing what they expect to happen already, well, the President might go for that.
*  Right. In addition to that, though, the President signaled on Tuesday that he might be
*  willing to cut some spending in a way that Republicans have been pushing for for a while.
*  Specifically, he would be open to canceling some of the money that was included in the stimulus
*  bill he signed in 2021, but hasn't been spent yet. Now, Republicans estimate that cancellation would
*  save $50 to $70 billion. But that's a really small slice of their total proposal to raise the debt
*  limit and cut spending, which actually sums up to nearly $5 trillion. Okay, so in this option,
*  Biden would say, look, I'll agree to a more moderate set of spending cuts. And in return,
*  Speaker McCarthy, you'll go ahead and raise the debt limit. No strings attached. That's certainly
*  one of the things that a lot of folks around Washington expect could be an outcome of these
*  discussions. But it's not clear that would work. Speaker McCarthy would have to sell that
*  compromise to Republicans in the House. And there are a lot of them who have really been
*  agitating for much, much deeper cuts than any kind of deal with the President would entail,
*  and who could very likely refuse to vote for it. Right. So big potential pitfalls to that one.
*  So what's the next option then? Well, if the President decides that it's just not fruitful
*  to talk to the Speaker, he could try to go around Kevin McCarthy. He could try to cut a deal
*  with just enough Republican votes to join with Democrats in the House and the Senate to raise
*  the debt limit. That would require doing something to bring probably five Republicans in the House
*  on board and close to 10 Republicans in the Senate. They'd have to probably use this legislative
*  maneuver called a discharge petition. Oh, boy. Yeah. It's a way to bring a bill to the floor
*  for a vote in the House, even if the Speaker of the House doesn't want it there. So theoretically,
*  they could do this arcane process to bring up a bill that they have a small number of Republicans
*  agreeing on to pass a debt limit increase with mostly Democratic votes. It's really tricky.
*  It takes a lot of time legislatively. It takes a lot of political capital, and there's no indication
*  that the sort of discussions are going on with Republicans or that there's even an appetite
*  among Republicans to make this happen. Got it. So these options don't look particularly easy,
*  either get Republicans to agree to weigh less than what they're asking for or convince enough
*  Republicans to turn their back on their party. Well, yeah, none of the legislative options are
*  perfect. It's true. And it is what's giving a lot of heartburn to people who watch Congress right
*  now is that they're having a hard time seeing how it would work. But there is another option.
*  That the administration is weighing. It's actually something that they've been talking about for
*  months that is still on the table today, and would be I wouldn't call it a nuclear option,
*  but a really big, bold risk that the president could take to try to end this debt limit fight
*  by himself. And what's that option? The president could decide to ignore Congress and ignore the
*  debt limit. He could follow a theory of the Constitution that is effectively a constitutional
*  challenge to the existence of the debt limit itself. It's rooted in the 14th Amendment to the
*  Constitution, which effectively says the government has to pay its debts. It can't just not pay.
*  But the 14th Amendment, like the 14th Amendment? Yeah, that 14th Amendment. I mean, that was the
*  amendment that was passed after the Civil War. And it was about slavery, right? Yeah. So what does it
*  have to do with the nation's debt? Okay, it's wonky, but bear with me here. Okay. As you just
*  said, the 14th Amendment is adopted right after the Civil War, at a time when lawmakers are setting
*  out the terms under which the states that had seceded to join the Confederacy would be allowed
*  to come back into the Union. Okay. It does a lot of stuff. It granted citizenship to former slaves,
*  for example. But it also includes a section, section four, if you're scoring at home, that says
*  the validity of the public debt of the United States shall not be questioned. And there's sort
*  of a quirky reason why they did that. It was about sort of the fears of Southern states regaining
*  political power in a new Congress. You know, the United States had borrowed money to finance the
*  Union Army in the Civil War. And there was a worry that if Southern senators and representatives
*  controlled Congress, they could just decide, oh, we're not going to pay the people we borrowed
*  money from for a war, you know, against our own states. Oh, interesting. So they wanted to make
*  sure that in the Constitution, it said, nope, you have to pay all the debts. Got it. So they were
*  coming back in, having political representation in Congress. And the idea was, no, you have to
*  accept and take on all of the debts. You can't back out of them. That's exactly right.
*  So under that theory, a president like President Biden could decide that the Constitution trumps
*  the law and that in this case, it requires the government to keep issuing new debt to pay off
*  its old debts, no matter what the debt limit says. So this clause has been around for a long time,
*  right, since the 19th century. Why haven't other presidents who faced this problem used it?
*  It has been around. And this is not the first time it's come up. It was raised in like a law
*  review article at the end of the 90s. But it really kind of entered the conversation from obscurity in
*  2011. After seven plus months of scathing political attacks, countless meetings between the president
*  and lawmakers, there is still no debt ceiling deal. When President Obama had that debt ceiling
*  fight with Republicans in the House, some top tier Democrats have said, the 14th amendment,
*  that might work for us. At the time, there was a lot of buzz about it. I'm hearing people talk a
*  little bit more about the feasibility of this 14th amendment option. Even former President Bill
*  Clinton said that he would have invoked the amendment if he was still president. There's a
*  strong argument for what Bill Clinton has argued. But inside the Obama White House,
*  I have talked to my lawyers. They are not persuaded that that is a winning argument.
*  They never really seriously consider this. And why didn't they consider it seriously? Well,
*  first off, it's not clear cut in the Constitution. The Constitution also says that
*  taxing and spending resides with Congress. So it's a theory, and it's a theory that has some
*  scholarship behind it, but it's not a cut and dry, everyone agrees on it interpretation of the
*  Constitution. But beyond that, there were other considerations driving the Obama team when they
*  didn't consider this and that are giving the Biden team pause now. And the biggest one is this,
*  even if a president were to believe that this is constitutionally the right thing to do
*  and take this leap, that leap would bring some really profound consequences.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, so Jim, walk me through what the consequences would be if the Biden
*  administration actually decides to go for this thing, the 14th Amendment strategy.
*  Well, first off, we don't know exactly what would happen. But I don't think it would be that the
*  president would step outside the White House one day and run out and scream into the void,
*  I invoke the 14th Amendment. Oh, no.
*  But I mean, unlikely. Possible. Good television. I don't think so. But as the June 1 deadline
*  approaches, the government, you know, runs out of the ability to pay its bills. So the president
*  will essentially say, Okay, I'm going to call the Treasury Secretary and tell her that we are
*  invoking the 14th Amendment. And so we need to have another round of raising money to pay our
*  debts. Like Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary, can just do that. Well, her department holds
*  what's called a Treasury auction happens all the time. And it's when the government goes out and
*  sells new bonds to lenders who are essentially giving the government money now in exchange for
*  the government giving them some more money later on down the road. So Biden calling up Yellen says,
*  just do another Treasury auction. We do them every week. Do one this week. Like that sounds
*  okay, right? Like, where's the problem there? Well, the problem is in the auction itself,
*  and it's specifically with the buyers of the government bonds. They, for good reason,
*  might not be so sure that this debt they would be borrowing is actually going to pay off down the
*  road. If there's a constitutional question about whether the government will actually be allowed to
*  issue these bonds, well, then maybe you're buying something that's worthless. So those buyers in the
*  Treasury auction are going to do what buyers in auctions do all the time when they're buying a
*  riskier asset, which is they're going to pay less money for it. And what effectively does that mean?
*  Effectively, what it means is that the government is going to have to pay a much higher interest rate
*  to borrow money in the short term. It's kind of like taking out a payday loan with a really high
*  rate. But would the financial fallout here be worse than if the government just defaulted on
*  its debt altogether? Probably not. I mean, that is a big part of the consideration here. I mean,
*  this would be chaos. An actual default on the debt could be crippling chaos. If the debt limit is
*  hit and we truly breach the X date, the markets are going to go nuts no matter what Biden does,
*  and not just Treasury markets. But in this case, what's going to happen is the government's going
*  to at least keep that money flowing into the economy, which will be less of a disruption than
*  if it just stopped paying people. And the trade off is it's going to be paying a really high
*  interest rate to borrow that money to keep flowing. So these are the financial perils.
*  But I mean, there must be some pretty serious legal consequences here too, right? I mean,
*  Biden is essentially circumventing Congress. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it is basically a
*  guarantee that someone would challenge this in court if Biden did it. And what would that look
*  like? Well, there's a real chance that some lower court somewhere in the country would decide that,
*  in fact, the government can't do this, that the Constitution does not say what Biden is saying,
*  and that the Constitution vests power for taxing and spending only with Congress.
*  And the Biden administration would appeal and it would very likely end up at the United States
*  Supreme Court because, you know, that is how these big fights seem to end up these days.
*  Right, right. So, okay, it gets the Supreme Court, then what?
*  Well, the Supreme Court could decide any number of things. On the one hand, they could decide that
*  the plaintiff is correct, that the government cannot issue any more debt. And it might say
*  that debt is invalid that was just issued in the Treasury auction or that the government has to
*  give the buyers their money back. So that would then cause the default that the administration
*  had been trying to avoid. All the government spending would come to a halt, pretty dire
*  economic situation. And presumably what those bond buyers were worried about, right?
*  Right, exactly. On the other hand, the Supreme Court could side with Biden. And that could happen
*  in actually a couple of different ways. For one, it could decide that no one has standing to sue
*  to challenge Biden's move because you need to show harm in order to be a plaintiff in a case
*  like this. And the court could decide that, well, no one is harmed by the government continuing to
*  issue debt. The second thing it could do, of course, is just agree with this interpretation
*  of the Constitution. It could say the president is correct, the 14th Amendment overrides the law,
*  and the government must keep paying its debts. In either of those scenarios, it would effectively
*  be agreeing with Biden that the debt limit is unconstitutional and basically strike it down.
*  So in that scenario, I mean, if the administration did move forward with this constitutional
*  strategy, and it worked, as you're describing there, it would mean the end of these debt limit
*  fights altogether, right? Which would seem to be a bit of a political earthquake.
*  It would be. It would be a political earthquake. It's certainly something that a lot of Democrats
*  and progressives who have pushed this interpretation of the Constitution for a long time would love to
*  see. They would call it an end to the Republican hostage taking over the debt limit. Short term,
*  however, it would be a really big mess for the operations of this Congress and this government
*  and this president. Describe that mess. Well, very bluntly put, it would make Republicans
*  really angry. And they could retaliate in a number of ways. One of the easiest ways they could
*  retaliate is by deciding, hey, the money that funds all of the government services that people
*  know and use runs out at the end of September, and we're just not going to pass a bill,
*  appropriately, any more money until Biden, you know, reverses course on the debt limit.
*  So essentially, even if Janet Yellen is out there raising money, having these debt auctions,
*  there are ways that Congress can still throw some pretty serious hurdles in the way of the
*  government's finances. Yeah, Congress has to appropriate the money to run basic government
*  operations. Now, everything from the military to the education department to the national parks,
*  and they could just decide in protest not to do that for a while or indefinitely until the
*  president comes to the table and meets their demands. So even if Biden does this, you know,
*  and it goes okay, or at the very least, it doesn't blow up completely, it's still pretty
*  politically risky for him. Yeah, this is a political consideration that has been discussed
*  inside the administration. And that risk extends well beyond Congress. I mean, I think it's very
*  fair to say that we have no idea what public opinion would be about this. It's certainly
*  not something that's been debated in the open. It hasn't been aired in campaign commercials.
*  You know, the president is just starting to run for reelection. And he'd be taking a risk here,
*  hoping that voters would reward him for acting decisively to keep the nation from defaulting,
*  but worrying that voters might get angry about it. And often when voters are angry,
*  they blame the president. So that's a risk for him as well. So Jim, big picture here, how likely
*  is it that this 14th Amendment strategy actually gets used by the Biden administration? I mean,
*  given these risks you're laying out? Well, something really interesting on this happened on Tuesday,
*  after his meeting with congressional leaders, this nation is never to fall on his debt. It never will.
*  President Biden gave a statement and then took questions from reporters. And he was asked if he
*  would consider invoking the 14th Amendment. He said he was looking at it. He mentioned the legal
*  reasons why it might not be a great idea, but he explicitly kept it on the table. I think that's
*  important. I think it certainly makes it much more likely that it could happen than people thought
*  weeks ago when the president is refusing to rule it out in public in the midst of these talks with
*  Republicans. Interesting. Now, with all that said, I think there's still a decent chance that whether
*  it's through a negotiation or a steering contest or whatever, the president and Congress end with
*  an agreement to raise the debt limit before we hit the X state. That could mean kicking the can down
*  the road just a little bit, a month or two to give them more time to talk about the debt limit. And
*  there's always this possibility that financial markets will freak out right before a possible
*  default and that that could spur Congress to act. But regardless of whether Biden actually pulls the
*  trigger on this 14th Amendment idea, isn't the fact that it's become such a point of conversation
*  kind of meaningful in and of itself? Like we've gotten to this point that this option is on the
*  table. I mean, what does that tell us about where we are right now as a country, as a political system?
*  I actually had an interview this week with someone who has been around Washington for a long time
*  and was talking to me on background about this crisis. And what he said was, I think, very
*  resonant to this question, which was no one trusts each other in Washington like they used to.
*  Right. Inside the Biden administration, they do not trust that Republicans are actually going to raise
*  the debt limit in time in the same way that the Obama administration trusted that.
*  And Republicans don't trust that Biden won't circumvent them. So it's almost self reinforcing.
*  That lack of trust reflects a divided electorate, an angry electorate, people turning against each
*  other in this country. And I think it has made even routine things like raising a debt limit,
*  not at all routine. And the president has sort of had enough of this. He led the negotiations in 2011
*  to resolve the debt limit standoff. And this time, he's just done with it. He doesn't want
*  to be negotiating over the debt limit. He does not see it as appropriate. He sees it as hostage
*  taking. And so for all those reasons, this does not feel the same as those previous fights to me.
*  And that raises the possibility that it could end differently.
*  Jim, thank you.
*  Thank you so much.
*  President Biden, Speaker McCarthy, and other congressional leaders were scheduled to meet at
*  the White House again this afternoon to continue their negotiations over the debt limit. But on
*  Thursday, the White House announced that that meeting had been postponed. We'll be right back.
*  Here's what you should know today. On Thursday, Manhattan prosecutors said that they would bring
*  criminal charges against Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old Marine veteran who choked and killed
*  a homeless man on the subway. The district attorney's office said it would charge Penny
*  with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Jordan Neely on an F train on May 1st. Penny is
*  expected to appear in Manhattan criminal court on Friday. And the Food and Drug Administration
*  announced that it has formally ended a longstanding policy of not accepting blood
*  donations from gay and bisexual men. Instead, the agency is finalizing new guidance that will
*  require all blood donors to fill out a questionnaire about their recent sexual activity. The change
*  effectively ends a federal policy that had long been considered discriminatory.
