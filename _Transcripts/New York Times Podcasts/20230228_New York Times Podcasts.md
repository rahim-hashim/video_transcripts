# Why So Many Buildings Collapsed in Turkey
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8veLTQQ_AFk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  The scale of death in the earthquake in Turkey and Syria is now raising questions about who
*  is to blame.
*  In Turkey, the government has placed that blame squarely on builders and property developers,
*  accusing them of choosing profits over safety.
*  But the reality is far more complicated.
*  Today, my colleague Ben Hubbard, on why a good part of the responsibility may rest with
*  the Turkish government itself.
*  It's Tuesday, February 28.
*  So, Ben, we're now at more than 50,000 dead in the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.
*  And for weeks, the question we've all been asking is, how is it possible that so many
*  people could have died?
*  You've been investigating that question in Turkey, where the loss of life was by far
*  the greatest.
*  Tell us what you've learned so far.
*  The first thing we need to acknowledge is that this was a very powerful quake, and it
*  struck a very, very large territory.
*  So that's what we're starting with.
*  And when I got to the earthquake zone after this had happened, one of the first things
*  that struck me is that not everything is knocked down.
*  You have this sort of puzzling mosaic of like some areas where the buildings, at least from
*  the outside, look more or less fine.
*  And then all of a sudden, you'll find one that's like completely flat.
*  There was one particular site that we went to where there was a work crew working trying
*  to rescue some people who were trapped in the rubble.
*  And there just happened to be a bunch of volunteer construction workers who were standing around
*  sort of willing to help out.
*  They were there with their hard hats and their equipment, and they were inspecting the site.
*  And they were commenting on how the rebar that was there looked like it was poor quality.
*  The cement looks like it was kind of weak.
*  One of the guys literally walked over and picked up this big chunk of concrete and sort
*  of tore it apart with his hands.
*  And they were just all clicking their tongues and just really asking like, what happened
*  here?
*  Like, what was wrong with these buildings that fell down?
*  How were these buildings built?
*  Then this wondering about these buildings just turns into anger.
*  Almost a week after the earthquakes, the blame game begins.
*  And the government responds, and they respond by going after the builders.
*  Turkish authorities have issued arrest warrants for over a hundred people.
*  They include contractors, architects and engineers accused of shoddy and illegal construction.
*  They start by arresting construction contractors, people who were linked to some of these buildings
*  and then that really accelerates.
*  Two property developers have reportedly been arrested at airports accused of trying to
*  flee the country.
*  We've seen people who have been sort of perp walked on national television with their handcuffs
*  on sort of marching into the police car.
*  So far, 188 people arrested, but more than 600 people have now been identified as potential
*  suspects in relation to those allegations of construction negligence.
*  So the government is really putting the focus on the construction people saying that, you
*  know, these people are the problem.
*  They're the ones who put up these buildings that weren't strong enough.
*  Okay, so the government is cracking down on the people it says are the guilty parties.
*  In other words, the builders.
*  Right, but it turns out it's much, much more complicated than that.
*  I mean, we, me and my colleagues here in Istanbul started looking into this, investigating who
*  these people were, how the industry works, and just trying to figure out, you know, how
*  did these buildings get built and what were the problems?
*  Why were there buildings that came down and other ones that didn't?
*  And I was still very early in the process.
*  It's difficult to sort of even identify some of these buildings and figure out who was
*  responsible for them, who built them.
*  But what we found is that the story really starts back in 1999.
*  This was when you had the last really massive earthquake in Turkey.
*  Earthquake rescue efforts were underway in Western Turkey today after a massive earthquake
*  struck during the night.
*  This is a very powerful earthquake that hits the city of Izmit, which is not far from Istanbul.
*  Some buildings swayed and survived while others collapsed.
*  According to local people, this one here may have fallen because the top two stories were
*  jerry built without official permission.
*  There's huge, huge damage to the city, you know, collapsed buildings and people buried.
*  And it's just really, it's just a terrible situation.
*  It kills more than 17,000 people.
*  And the government is just wildly lambasted for its response.
*  This is do-it-yourself rescue and it is chaos.
*  There's just this sense that they had no ability to respond in time to get rescuers, to get
*  aid in place for survivors.
*  But as their shock wears off, the people's anger is starting to show.
*  A few years later, we have this huge economic crisis that really hits people's pocketbooks.
*  And all of this together, this sense of just the country being so vulnerable to this terrible
*  natural disaster, plus all of the economic pain of this crisis, just creates this huge
*  anger at the government that had been in place at the time.
*  And this new party called the Justice and Development Party sort of rides this wave
*  of anger.
*  What you're telling me with this welcome, with this interest, is that Turkey will go
*  through a major change after the November elections.
*  They really campaigned on this idea that they were going to be more competent, less corrupt,
*  and more transparent than the previous guys.
*  The basic idea was that the previous parties had messed everything up and we're going
*  to come in and we're going to do a much, much better job.
*  The Justice and Development Party won an overwhelming victory in Sunday's national elections.
*  Enough voters believe that, that they brought them into the parliament and they ended up
*  with the ability in 2003 to name the prime minister.
*  And they chose at that time this up-and-coming politician named Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
*  So Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who's been running the country for 20 years now, he really rises
*  to power in a lot of ways off the back of this bungled political response from the previous
*  government.
*  It definitely contributes to his rise.
*  And then, you know, in the next number of years, the country really takes off.
*  Green fields on the outskirts of Istanbul, fields that will soon be transformed into
*  a massive building site.
*  There's great economic growth and a large part of that is really this idea of sort of
*  build, build, build.
*  The skyline is changing rapidly as the city grows upwards and outwards.
*  Everything is going higher, faster and further.
*  When new buildings replace the old, a different economic class will move here.
*  There's large parts of society that rise into the middle class.
*  There'll be upmarket properties designed to appeal to Turkey's burgeoning middle classes.
*  This idea that, you know, you as a Turkish family can sort of have your own apartment
*  in a nice city.
*  And this becomes a reality for huge parts of the population that were before, you know,
*  quite impoverished.
*  New shopping malls are opening up on an almost monthly basis.
*  And there's just construction happening everywhere at this point.
*  And there's plenty of land waiting for development.
*  So Erdogan's solution after the 1999 earthquake and economic crisis is to actually invest
*  in building and development as a way to revive Turkey's economy.
*  Right.
*  But the dark side of all this construction is that Turkey has very, very active fault
*  lines in large parts of the country.
*  This is a land that has histories of earthquakes going back as long as there is recorded history
*  and really every reason to believe that there will be future powerful earthquakes.
*  So one of the things that the government is doing is really trying to reform how buildings
*  are built, upgrading building codes, upgrading standards for materials to try to ensure that
*  the new buildings that are built are going to be able to withstand earthquakes.
*  Right.
*  Because they don't want the buildings to collapse like they did in 1999.
*  Yes.
*  And so they've done things like upgrading the engineering calculations that you have
*  to do to decide how much structure you need to support a building of a certain size.
*  There's been work on the standards for what kind of materials you use, whether it's concrete
*  or iron or rebar or these sorts of things and upgrading this basically as the technology
*  develops.
*  And you know, this process has been going on for a long time, but where Turkey's at
*  now, everybody that we talked to basically said the codes are world class.
*  Theoretically, these codes are some of the best that you could come up with to create
*  earthquake proof buildings.
*  But when we've started looking into this in the last two weeks, what really became clear
*  is that in a lot of cases, they're just not followed.
*  Hold on.
*  So the Turkish government realizes there's a risk to all this construction.
*  They upgrade their building codes.
*  But why aren't people following them?
*  Part of it is that in the midst of this building boom, there's this kind of Wild West atmosphere
*  that emerges.
*  So you ended up having huge problems in the inspections regime.
*  You know, ideally to make sure that the rules are followed, you're going to have smart,
*  independent inspectors going out, looking at the sites, finding out where things are
*  not being done correctly or poor materials are being used.
*  And in a lot of cases, this is just not happening.
*  There was a practice of construction companies being able to hire private inspection companies
*  to come out to their sites and do the inspections.
*  Private inspection companies?
*  Like, isn't that the government's job?
*  Of course, it should be the government's job.
*  But they were able to hire these private companies and private inspection companies want to keep
*  getting work.
*  And if they get a reputation for shutting down people's projects, they're not going
*  to get hired anymore.
*  So they sort of have an incentive to approve projects that maybe they should not.
*  And wow, that's complete conflict of interest, right?
*  That's crazy.
*  Well, it gets it gets even worse than that, because in some cases, according to a lot
*  of the industry professionals we talked to, construction companies would actually set
*  up their own inspection companies.
*  And so they would effectively be hiring themselves to inspect their own projects.
*  So the government just completely abdicated responsibility for this really important function.
*  I would say there were significant holes in the checks that were put in place to ensure
*  that these codes were followed.
*  And the result of that is that there were buildings that went up that were not nearly
*  as strong as they should have been.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Ben, you've just finished telling us that Turkey's earthquake codes were really world
*  class, but they weren't really enforced.
*  So is Erdogan just fine with all of this?
*  Like isn't he worried that this could come back to bite him?
*  Yeah, I mean, you would think because of his history that, you know, of all the politicians
*  in Turkey, he would be incredibly attuned to the to the tremendous power that earthquakes
*  have to affect politics.
*  But there hasn't been a whole lot of sign of that.
*  And in fact, this government has been quite cavalier about it.
*  I mean, over the years, they've pushed through these things that are known as building amnesties.
*  What are they?
*  So there are lots of buildings in Turkey that are not up to code.
*  And over time, the government becomes aware of these.
*  Either inspectors find that, you know, somebody has enclosed their balcony without a permit.
*  Somebody has added a few floors to their building, perhaps to earn a bit of extra rent money.
*  Somebody has decided to sell the ground floor to some business who cuts out some of the
*  pillars to get more space.
*  And this comes to the government's attention, either because inspectors find it or because
*  the neighbors sue.
*  So you have these cases of code violations that just pile up and pile up.
*  And every once in a while, the government basically issues an amnesty where they wipe
*  the slate clean.
*  The way that it works is that if you have been reported for having done something to
*  your building that violates the code, you pay a fine.
*  And in a lot of cases, people don't even have to fix what it is that they had the code violation
*  for, even if it's something like cutting the ground floor pillars of a building, which
*  could very much make it more vulnerable than an earthquake.
*  So basically, the government is waiving all of these violations, despite the fact that
*  they could lead to some pretty dangerous situations.
*  Right.
*  So on top of the fact that the system of building inspections is pretty spotty, even when the
*  inspections do turn something up and they find violations of the building code, the
*  government sometimes just forgives them.
*  But why?
*  Well, there's a number of reasons.
*  First is that the government earns money off of it.
*  I mean, everybody who has code violations that they want forgiven, they pay a fine.
*  In the most recent amnesty, this ended up bringing more than $4 billion into the government
*  purse.
*  So there's a reason that the government likes it.
*  And voters really like it.
*  People invest money in property.
*  If you're a hardworking Turkish family and you've taken your savings and you've bought
*  a family apartment or a family home, the last thing you want is for the government to come
*  and find a code violation and condemn the building or knock it down because you're going
*  to lose your investment.
*  So people love these things.
*  And this is why they tend to happen during elections.
*  The most recent one was put in place during the presidential election in 2018.
*  And the year after, Erdogan goes on the campaign trail in local elections and is basically
*  bragging about it to people saying, look at this great thing that we did in this town.
*  We forgave X number of code violations.
*  And portraying this is this great service that we've done to the people.
*  And ultimately, this most recent round of amnesty, they ended up forgiving code violations
*  on more than 7 million units across the country.
*  Which sounds like a lot of units.
*  Is it?
*  How do I understand that number?
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a country of about 80 million people.
*  So yeah, 7 million units is it's a lot of units.
*  But weren't people worried about the safety of their homes?
*  I mean, there are definitely people who are concerned.
*  You know, there's a whole group of seismologists in Turkey who have really been sounding the
*  alarm and making it very clear that according to all of the science, it's just only a matter
*  of time before more powerful earthquakes hit Turkey.
*  I think a lot of them feel like nobody really listens to them.
*  You do have inspectors, you do have engineers and people pointing things out.
*  I mean, there was a couple that we interviewed, two lawyers who had filed 51 court cases against
*  this one builder in their town because they thought that he was violating the code all
*  over the place.
*  So there were definitely people who were looking out for this.
*  But there's something that I think is just human nature in thinking about something like
*  an earthquake that nobody knows when it's going to happen.
*  It could happen tomorrow.
*  It could happen next week.
*  It could happen 100 years from now.
*  I think it's sometimes hard before the actual earthquake comes for people to conceive what
*  it's going to look like and what it's going to mean for their lives.
*  And, you know, it allows people to kind of go along with this magical thinking of like,
*  maybe we'll just dodge the bullet.
*  Like it's a distant danger, not an immediate one.
*  And therefore, I'm going to think about it on a different day.
*  I'm not going to think about it today.
*  I mean, it's not unlike climate change in that it's this danger that people know is
*  sort of looming in the future.
*  Even if you're convinced that it's there, it's still in your daily life feels kind of
*  remote.
*  And in the meantime, you have other things to worry about that feel much more pressing.
*  And so it's I think human nature to focus on the things that are right before you.
*  Right.
*  But it's incumbent on government to actually force people to do the right thing, right?
*  Collectively.
*  But in this case, the Turkish government didn't.
*  It actually made things worse, which leads me back to Erdogan.
*  He's arrested these builders.
*  But what about him?
*  Will he and his party have to pay a price for this?
*  Well, the big test is going to be elections.
*  There are parliamentary and presidential elections expected in May.
*  And these are crucial for him.
*  I mean, he would like to stay in power.
*  He's been having a hard time in the polls this year, largely because of economic troubles
*  at home.
*  Lots of voters were quite mad at the way that he had been running the country before the
*  earthquake even hit.
*  And then you have this huge natural disaster that's killed all these people.
*  It's hard to see how that benefits him at all in this election.
*  And so he's been almost every day he's been down in the earthquake zone with this very
*  grave look on his face, wearing this long black coat, meeting with people who are living
*  in tent cities, meeting with earthquake victims and seeing the rubble.
*  And you're really showing this kind of tangible connection with this disaster that's gone
*  on.
*  And we're going to have to wait and see how that really resonates with voters.
*  He has not spoken much about everything that we've been talking about, about how did all
*  these buildings end up getting built that didn't seem like they were done right to withstand
*  an earthquake.
*  The most that he said is we as a country have things that we need to learn from this disaster
*  and we should do better in the future.
*  That's kind of as much as we've gotten.
*  But interestingly, what he's promised, I think the biggest promise that he's made to his
*  people is that we're going to rebuild.
*  Basically there's going to be more construction.
*  He said that we're going to start in March and he wants to rebuild homes for all these
*  people within a year, which is quite remarkable and incredibly ambitious promise.
*  So instead of saying we need enforcement, we really need to look at how we're doing
*  this.
*  He's saying construction is the answer.
*  Yeah there's really a doubling down on this policy that's been such a large part of his
*  tenure.
*  It's still build, build, build.
*  That's the solution.
*  And Erdogan has proven over the 20 years that he's been on the national stage that he's
*  a survivor.
*  He's a very deft politician and even with a challenge as large as an earthquake of this
*  magnitude, there's a chance that he's going to push through and that he's going to find
*  a way to win this election.
*  But there's really also this sense of history echoing itself that it was a catastrophic
*  earthquake that helped fuel Erdogan's rise to the national stage.
*  And here we are 20 years later and it's another catastrophic earthquake that he's got a face
*  now and that in a lot of ways could really imperil his political future.
*  Ben, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the conservative media empire that owns Fox News,
*  acknowledged that several hosts for his networks promoted the false narrative that the 2020
*  election was stolen from former president Donald Trump.
*  In court documents released on Monday that are part of a lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems,
*  Murdoch said that Fox hosts Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo
*  quote, endorsed the false theory.
*  He said, quote, I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight.
