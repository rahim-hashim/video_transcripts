# A Breaking Point for the U.S. Auto Industry
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx6g7Ct_N4M)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Later this week, as many as 150,000 U.S. auto workers may begin a historic strike against
*  their employers, carmakers collectively known as the Big Three.
*  Today, my colleague, Neil Baudet, on the tangled decades-long dynamic that explains why such
*  a walkout looks increasingly likely.
*  It's Tuesday, September 12th.
*  Neil, we are here to talk with you about a very big potential strike.
*  And it occurs to me that this has already been a summer of uniquely intense labor activism
*  in the United States.
*  It has.
*  It's been quite a summer.
*  The Hollywood writers went out on strike.
*  They were followed by the Hollywood actors.
*  They're still on strike.
*  The Teamsters and UPS were negotiating a contract.
*  There was a threat of a strike there.
*  In the end, they did come up with a contract.
*  There was a local hotel strike in Los Angeles.
*  So it's been a really busy summer in terms of labor movement.
*  And now we're coming to what could be the biggest labor conflict of the year, and that's
*  a potential strike between Ford, GM, and Stellantis, which is the parent of Chrysler
*  on one side and the United Auto Workers on the other side.
*  And why might this be the biggest?
*  Because the auto industry is a big piece of the U.S. economy.
*  It's the largest manufacturing sector.
*  It employs 150,000 UAW workers.
*  And the union is threatening to strike all three companies at the same time.
*  It's never done that before.
*  And the impact would be significant.
*  It would cost the automakers billions of dollars in lost revenue and profit.
*  There would be a ripple effect among their hundreds of suppliers.
*  And in the Midwestern states, it could bring local economies to a halt.
*  And is a strike likely, Neil?
*  I think a strike is almost certain.
*  You have these two sides, the United Auto Workers and the three companies, that have
*  a long and fraught history with each other.
*  It's kind of like a marriage that has had its ups and downs and its trauma and pain.
*  And it is all coming to a head in these contract talks that are coming down to the wire.
*  Well, Neil, tell us about the history, the trauma and the pain of this long, complicated
*  marriage between the big three automakers and the UAW, this union that represents their
*  workers and why, in your mind, it might result in a strike that could shake the economy.
*  What's that backstory?
*  So if we go back to the 1960s, the big three automakers were practically the entire U.S.
*  auto industry.
*  They made nine out of every 10 cars that were sold in the United States.
*  And because of that, the union had a great deal of power.
*  If they went out on strike, they could shut down a whole chunk of the U.S. auto industry.
*  And in fact, that happened in 1970.
*  The negotiations go on in Detroit with little hope of averting a strike and more than half
*  a dozen General Motors plants in the United States and Canada.
*  We feel that we work hard in the shop building these good cars for General Motors and for
*  the customers.
*  And we feel that if this is the way that we have to do, we have to strike, then we're
*  going to hit the street.
*  They were on strike against GM for 67 days.
*  General Motors has been on strike for more than two weeks now.
*  And in Flint, Michigan, a GM strike takes $8 million a week out of the economy.
*  And it really shook the U.S. economy and brought most of the auto industry to a halt.
*  Good evening.
*  General Motors and the United Auto Workers have announced tentative agreement on a new
*  three-year contract, an agreement that would end the strike, which is now threatening the
*  nation's economy.
*  And that win in 1970 was just one of a series of victories for the union in contract negotiations.
*  The new contract calls for a three-year increase in wages and fringe benefits, which would
*  give the auto workers an extra $1.80 an hour and would cost GM in the third year an extra
*  billion and a half dollars.
*  They got increased wages and increasingly richer benefits.
*  Their health care is almost totally covered by the companies.
*  So what happened was the auto workers were able to live a very comfortable middle-class
*  life.
*  They could send their kids to college, have a cottage on the lake and a boat.
*  And it really set the standard for middle-class people in the United States and helped lift
*  the wages of non-union workers and other unionized workers in different industries.
*  It feels like in a sense everybody was winning at this stage of the marriage, right?
*  The big three are selling almost every car being bought in the U.S.
*  They're doing well.
*  And because of the leverage that it has, the union and its workers are doing very well
*  themselves.
*  Everybody's kind of winning.
*  Yes, but then that starts to change.
*  These people all have one thing in common besides a happy smile.
*  They all own dependable Toyota Corolla.
*  What happens is foreign competition arrives.
*  All across the country you'll see signs announcing the best gas mileage car in America.
*  The Honda Civic 1313.
*  Toyota and Honda start selling more and more cars in the United States and taking market
*  share away from the big three.
*  Toyota, who could ask for anything more?
*  Then in the 80s, both Honda and Toyota and then others start building their own plants
*  in the United States.
*  They go to states where they can have non-union workers and pay lower wages.
*  So suddenly the big three go from the 60s where they dominated the industry and were
*  making a lot of money to a very difficult competitive situation where they're losing
*  market share.
*  They're woefully uncompetitive in terms of cost and especially on quality.
*  So the balance in the industry starts to shift and Ford, GM and Chrysler are kind of reeling
*  from the 80s on.
*  This I should acknowledge is the era where I grew up in, the early and mid and late 80s.
*  I remember my mom showing up at home with a light blue Toyota Camry.
*  We had always previously owned American cars.
*  She bought into this vision, our whole family did, of the very reliable, dependable foreign
*  car.
*  And from then on out, we never owned American cars.
*  That is a really common experience for lots of people.
*  It happened in my family.
*  My father bought a 1980 Chevy Citation, which was probably one of the worst cars ever made.
*  It broke down so often that then he switched to Toyota.
*  And then when I went to buy my first car, I bought a Honda.
*  And that happened for people all across the country.
*  And what that did was alienated customers from the big three for almost a whole generation.
*  So the big three are losing market share, but their workers are still doing relatively
*  well.
*  And I'm going to assume that this is when the marriage starts to fray.
*  Right.
*  The workers are getting relatively high pay and good benefits, but the big three are losing
*  market share and they need to downsize.
*  So the union is concerned about, well, when plants close, what happens to those workers.
*  And they negotiate a deal in 1984 to create something they called the jobs bank.
*  They would close a plant, but the workers would stay on the payroll, making most of
*  their wages.
*  That does not sound very efficient.
*  It's not.
*  They had to report for work and more or less sit in a room and they could read books and
*  play board games and hang out.
*  And the automakers thought it would just be a temporary thing.
*  They would only do this for a few years.
*  They'd restructure, they'd come back better than ever.
*  They'd regain market share and they would reopen these plants and they would need these
*  But in the end, that didn't happen.
*  They never really regained their competitive edge.
*  And there were thousands of these workers on the payroll who were not producing cars.
*  And so that put another big cost on their books.
*  And so how do the big three deal with this?
*  That seems extremely expensive.
*  It is expensive.
*  So they had to find ways to save money elsewhere.
*  They had to use cheaper materials and design cars that were less costly to produce.
*  And so what you ended up with was some really crappy cars.
*  And I think if you talk to GM executives today, they will admit back in the day they made
*  some really crappy cars, but that was all they could do on the budget they had.
*  And so it just made the competitive problem get even worse.
*  Right.
*  Because if you're already struggling to keep up with a more dependable foreign import like
*  Toyota and your solution is to make crappy cars with cheaper materials, you're not going
*  to close that gap.
*  Exactly.
*  OK, so what happens next?
*  Well, they get to the mid 2000s and they're really struggling to make money.
*  In one year, Ford loses $12 billion.
*  And they come to the contract talks in 2007 and the automakers go to the union.
*  They explain that they are in dire straits, in danger of collapse.
*  They open their books and the union sees how bad it is and realize that they can't keep
*  asking for more.
*  They have to do something to help these companies get back on their feet.
*  We're learning more about the concessions UAW workers will be asked to make at the Ford
*  Clay Como plant.
*  And that's when you have two measures that really make a big impact.
*  One is the union agrees to let the automakers hire new workers at about $15 an hour.
*  That's about half of what the top union wage was, which was $28 an hour at that time.
*  And they also create a trust fund to cover the cost of retiree health care.
*  So this gets Ford, GM and Chrysler out of the health care business.
*  And that's a big burden off their books.
*  Now UAW leadership told our Michael Mahoney today that they are not happy at all with
*  this concession package.
*  Nonetheless, they are urging their rank and file to pass the package for fear that if
*  they do not, that they could force Ford into bankruptcy.
*  At that time, they also agreed to finally get rid of the jobs bank.
*  They came up with some terms where people who were in the jobs bank would take early
*  retirement and then they stopped putting people into the jobs bank.
*  Members of the United Auto Workers Union have ratified a package of concessions designed
*  to reduce General Motors labor costs.
*  It's a huge inflection point for the industry because for decades it had always been more,
*  more, more for the union.
*  And this is a point where finally that stops and the union has to take a step back from
*  the kind of wages and benefit gains that they've been used to.
*  What once seemed impossible is now all but inevitable.
*  General Motors is expected to officially file for bankruptcy tomorrow morning.
*  The next thing that happened was the financial crisis.
*  Chrysler will receive billions in bailout money from the federal government.
*  The company will enter bankruptcy to clear its books of debt that it couldn't bargain
*  away.
*  They get some more changes to their labor terms and go through a deep restructuring.
*  And finally, these companies are freed of the things that have been weighing them down
*  for so long and they're freed to go back to focusing on making good cars and competing
*  against their foreign rivals.
*  And does that actually happen?
*  Do they become more competitive?
*  Yes, they're able to put a lot more money into design and nicer materials so they have
*  these plush interiors.
*  They develop fuel efficient engines and new transmissions and instead of making crappy
*  cars, they start making really nice cars.
*  First rule of taking the world by surprise, do something the world will actually notice.
*  Introducing the entirely new Ford Fusion.
*  The Ford Fusion was redesigned and came out and it was a real head-turner.
*  It's an entirely new idea of what a car can be.
*  GM did the same thing with the Chevy Malibu.
*  Here's a fact, Chevrolet Malibu has better highway fuel efficiency than Honda Accord
*  or Toyota Camry.
*  And then the market starts to shift to trucks and SUVs, which is really their forte and
*  a blockbuster quarter for General Motors.
*  North American profit doubled thanks in part to...
*  Their profits take off.
*  US auto sales posted their best month in 10 years in August.
*  By 2015 or 2016, they're making record profits.
*  This is a perfect example of a company that is in the sweet spot of the market right now.
*  In the last five years or so, GM has been making close to or more than $10 billion a
*  year, which was just unimaginable years ago.
*  We're finally seeing scale and profitability at General Motors.
*  The first time we've seen such things in all of their regions in many, many years.
*  So it becomes like this golden era for the big three automakers.
*  So the lesson here seems to be very clear that once unshackled from uncompetitive labor
*  costs and labor contracts that provide for things like a jobs bank that are deeply inefficient,
*  the big three can plow money into their actual products, the cars they make, and they make
*  them beautifully and high performing and it sounds like reliable and people want to buy
*  them and the companies thrive.
*  True.
*  Except for the workers, they look at these profits and think, hey, wait a minute, when
*  are we going to get back what we gave to the companies, the concessions that we made?
*  When are we going to see our wages rising as fast as the profits are rising?
*  And suddenly, they get a new union leader and he tells them, you're right, we are going
*  to fight.
*  We are going to get back what we've given up.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Neil, tell us about this new labor boss.
*  Sure.
*  His name is Sean Fain and he comes to power in a really interesting way.
*  The union president was elected by a group of delegates who were more or less chosen
*  by the union president and his associates and it was a patronage system.
*  You do a favor for the boss, you get a good job in the union hierarchy and it was not
*  a democracy.
*  So these leaders over time were not really responsive to what the members wanted and
*  you had a series of contracts, 2011, 2015, 2019, that didn't address what the rank and
*  file were calling for.
*  And at the same time, there was a lot of corruption in the union.
*  Well, from a lakefront house built up north just for him to months long stays at a Palm
*  Springs resort and the feds say Dennis Williams didn't pay a dime for it.
*  There were two past presidents and other senior officials who used union money for golf vacation
*  Former UAW president Gary Jones has been charged in the corruption scandal that's rocked the union.
*  They bought high-priced liquors, all kinds of expensive apparel, expensive cigars.
*  Wow.
*  And it has caused all kinds of ripples, lots of firings, and now the possibility of some
*  major jail time.
*  And these two presidents were actually sent to jail and because of this corruption, there's
*  a federal investigation and the upshot of that is, finally...
*  We are following breaking news from overnight as the United Auto Workers are just a few
*  votes away from naming a new president.
*  The union has their first direct election for a UAW president and this outsider, Sean
*  Fain, eventually wins in a runoff by a razor thin margin.
*  Today we say no corruption, no concessions, no tears.
*  Our job, starting here and now, is to unite the UAW and get back in the fight.
*  This is about ending sellout unionism and ending company control.
*  It is an honor of a lifetime to be elected to lead our union and I'll never forget that
*  the first time the members of the UAW were given the right to vote, we chose change,
*  we chose to fight.
*  And so for the first time in a long 80 plus year history of the UAW, they have a democratically
*  elected leader chosen by the members themselves.
*  So tell us about this first truly democratically elected leader of the UAW, Sean Fain.
*  Sean Fain is 54.
*  He is an electrician.
*  He worked at Chrysler for many years and then he himself got a position in the union administration.
*  His grandfather was also a union worker and he carries around his grandfather's very first
*  pay stub from when he started working as a union laborer years and years ago.
*  And he carries that around because that's his identity.
*  He really identifies himself as a working class person with working class values and
*  he keeps that pay stub to remind him of that.
*  So from the moment that he started campaigning, he promised the members that he was going
*  to fight.
*  If he were elected, the union would go back to their more confrontational, more aggressive
*  ways, and he promised them he was going to get back what they have given up.
*  So given that fighting spirit and that combativeness that he promises from the start, as this latest
*  negotiation with the big three gets underway over these past few months, what exactly is
*  Fain demanding from the companies?
*  He wants a significant increase in the hourly wage.
*  He has made an opening bid of 40%.
*  Big raise.
*  Yeah.
*  He points to the CEOs of the three companies and on average between them, their compensation
*  has gone up 40% over the last four years.
*  So he says if the CEOs get 40%, we deserve 40%.
*  He's probably not going to get that and probably knows that, but that's what he's aiming for.
*  He also wants to restore retiree healthcare paid by the companies.
*  He wants to have a new kind of jobs bank if plants close.
*  And he wants to undo this wage structure that was put in place where entry level workers
*  get paid significantly less than veteran workers.
*  What else?
*  And one of the most contentious things that he has raised is this idea of allowing workers
*  to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
*  And what he's really aiming at is that there are workers in some plants who are working
*  six days a week, seven days a week, sometimes 10 hour days, 12 hour days.
*  And what Fain says is that work-life balance isn't just for the managerial class, that
*  to get to a point where these workers cannot be compelled to work those sorts of long hours
*  and long weeks and give them some relief on that front.
*  So this is a very ambitious set of demands.
*  Not at all, it sounds like what the big three have been used to giving their workers over
*  the past few decades.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, the union hasn't made demands like this in the 21 years that I've covered the
*  auto industry.
*  And what are Fain's tactics, this fighter of a labor boss, as he is making these very
*  ambitious demands?
*  He uses a lot of populist tactics.
*  We're fed up, just like all the working class is fed up with watching these companies take
*  in billions in profits.
*  We've watched the CEOs rake in millions in salaries.
*  He's been going to rallies at plants to fire them up.
*  As we stand here today, I'm here to tell you there's a new day in this union and it's time
*  to end corporate greed.
*  And when he makes these speeches or these videos, he's very confrontational with the
*  automakers.
*  UAW family, I'm going to be blunt.
*  Everything they're looking for in this document is about concessions.
*  Chrysler put forward a proposal of terms that he didn't like.
*  So I'll tell you what I'm going to do with their proposal.
*  I'm going to file it in its proper place because that's where it belongs, the trash, because
*  that's what it is.
*  And on the video, he very ceremoniously took the document and dropped it into a wastebasket
*  and said, that's where it belongs, in the trash.
*  As we've said from day one, September 14th is a deadline, not a reference point.
*  I got a question for all of you.
*  Are you ready to rumble?
*  Well, to that point, what specifically have the big three said about these ambitious demands
*  and the fiery terms in which they are being delivered?
*  Well, all three automakers have hinted or suggested that they know they are going to
*  have to pay higher wages.
*  But on the other issues, they really don't want to go back on the entry level wages.
*  And there's no way they're going to agree to a new jobs bank.
*  This idea of the four day work week, they're not going to go along with that.
*  Retiree healthcare is another one.
*  They don't want to go back into that business.
*  So it's a very delicate balance.
*  They know that because they are making such significant profits, they have to give back
*  to their workers and reward them.
*  But they have to be careful not to go too far to put themselves back into an uncompetitive
*  situation.
*  They're basically saying, we don't want to go back in time the way you're asking us to.
*  And I suppose that makes some sense given the history of this marriage that you have
*  told us that the big three may still feel, despite their profits, pretty scarred by the
*  labor contracts of the 60s and 70s and 80s that they feel left them so saddled and financially
*  burdened and unimaginative in their ability to make good cars.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  One of the big reasons why they are so careful is they are in a very competitive situation
*  because of electric vehicles.
*  Explain that.
*  Well, the industry is making this historic shift to electric vehicles and all the automakers
*  have to invest tens of billions of dollars to develop new technologies, new batteries,
*  new vehicles, build new plants, retool the plants that they have to make EVs.
*  So they have a huge investment that they have to make.
*  They need to continue making significant profits in order to make those investments.
*  So they're very careful not to get into any kind of labor deal that really diminishes
*  the amount of money they're able to work because they fear down the road they'll be in another
*  really tough competitive situation with a big disadvantage the way they were 20 and
*  30 years ago.
*  So from what you're saying, the big three are unlikely to meet all of Fane's demands.
*  So that's why I'm guessing you think that a strike is very much in the realm of possibility.
*  But I'm curious, what happens if the UAW gets a lot of what it's asking for, either through
*  negotiations that avert a strike or through a very costly strike that might start in the
*  next couple of days?
*  Well, it would be a very big moment for organized labor.
*  The union has been shrinking over the decades and its members have been giving up things
*  rather than getting things.
*  But that could change if they deliver in terms of higher wages and some improved benefits.
*  It could give a tailwind to other efforts to unionize.
*  The foreign automakers have plants in the south that are non-union.
*  The UAW has tried to organize there, but the workers down in the south are like, what are
*  we going to get from the UAW?
*  Your plants are closing, you're giving back on wages.
*  If there's a big win here for the UAW, that changes.
*  All of a sudden, you might have workers in the south saying, hey, wait a minute, maybe
*  we could get higher wages.
*  Maybe we could get better working conditions if we were part of a union.
*  So there's a lot hanging in the balance here for the union and the labor movement in a
*  broader sense.
*  And what happens if the Fain playbook fails here?
*  That would be a major setback for organized labor.
*  Because Fain has a lot in his favor.
*  The companies are making big profits.
*  He has the backing of his members.
*  They're ready to walk out.
*  And if he can't achieve his goals in that situation, that doesn't bode well for other
*  labor organizations.
*  And the question is, if they go out on strike, how long does it last?
*  A three-day strike or a one-week strike could be something that the automakers can bear
*  and the workers can bear.
*  But if it's something that goes on for weeks and weeks, both sides could be damaged by
*  it.
*  But for Sean Fain, that pain is what may be required to get what he sees as a fair share
*  for the workers and a fair contract.
*  And to get the UAW back to what it was years ago, this powerful, influential union that
*  got continuous gains for its members and set a standard for working-class people all across
*  the country.
*  Well, Neil, thank you very much.
*  Glad to be here.
*  Thank you.
*  The UAW's contract with the Big Three is set to expire at 11.59 p.m. on Thursday night.
*  Sean Fain has said that unless the union's demands are met before then, a strike would
*  begin shortly thereafter.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to nerday.
*  On Monday, the death toll from the devastating earthquake that struck Morocco over the weekend
*  grew, rising to more than 2,800 people.
*  At the same time, government officials there pushed back against criticism that rescue
*  operations have been slow and uncoordinated, saying that the government's response has
*  been, quote, swift and effective.
*  And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new round of vaccines against
*  Covid, just as infection rates begin to rise across the country.
*  Federal regulators are expected to follow up today with a recommendation for exactly
*  who should receive the new shots, which will be made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
*  That recommendation, and the state of the virus, will be the subject of tomorrow's daily.
