*  From New York Times, I'm Mike Obabaro.
*  This is Adali.
*  Today, the latest leak of US military secrets, this time by a member of the National Guard,
*  has once again raised a familiar question.
*  Why do so many low-level government workers have access to so many classified documents?
*  The reason, according to my colleague, Dave Phillips, is that such access was supposed
*  to solve a problem, not create one.
*  It's Friday, April 21st.
*  Dave, one week ago, exactly, there is an arrest.
*  In this case, of this major leak of dozens of pages of secret military documents that have
*  now been splashed across the front pages of papers around the world and has become a major
*  embarrassment for the US. And ever since, you have been trying to understand this suspect's
*  backstory and how he ends up getting these documents in the first place. So, tell us what you found.
*  At first, we found very little. The FBI arrests a suspect and they don't tell us much.
*  Today, the Justice Department arrested Jack Douglas Tashira.
*  His name is Jack Tashira.
*  FBI agents took Tashira into custody earlier this afternoon without incident.
*  21 years old. Tashira is an employee of the United States Air Force National Guard.
*  He's a pretty low-ranking member of the Air National Guard at a base in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
*  And so, my colleagues and I start digging around trying to find more.
*  My colleagues went to the tiny town where he grew up, which is southwest of Boston.
*  It's rural. It's really pretty. It's conservative, voted for President Trump in both 2016 and 20,
*  which is fairly unusual for Massachusetts. And he seems to have had abnormal middle-class
*  suburban upbringing. His mom ran a floral business out of their house. His stepdad was a
*  master sergeant in the Air Force and actually worked at the same base where Tashira is accused of
*  stealing documents. And what people who went to high school with him say is he was kind of an
*  awkward, quiet kid. You know, on the pages of his high school yearbook, he doesn't show up many
*  places. He wasn't in many clubs. He wasn't big in any sports. But what's clear is during his high
*  school career, he was very focused on joining the military. In fact, he joined the Air National Guard
*  even before he graduated from high school and he missed his graduation in order to go to basic training.
*  And if what exactly for those of us who don't know the military nearly as well as you do
*  is the Air National Guard. Think of the National Guard as the part-time military. They call
*  themselves a citizen soldier. So what that means is you sign up for a commitment and you have to go
*  through training one week and a month and two weeks every summer. And those people, they're there
*  to be called up in case they're needed. Now, there are also people within the National Guard that will
*  work full-time. And that seems to be what Jack Chasero is doing. His job, the official name for it,
*  was a cyber defense operations journeyman, which sounds really impressive. But basically, he was
*  an IT guy. And he was there at the base working nights, making sure that all the computers worked.
*  The difference between him and it's a civilian equivalent is he's working on secure networks.
*  That handle pretty darn classified materials. And so as part of that job, he needs a top secret
*  security clearance. And that clearance not only led him into the room where these networks
*  were, but it led him access computers that held untold millions maybe of classified files.
*  And this, Dave, is what allows Jack Chasero to not just glimpse these documents, but actually
*  take them home. Right. And that's where it gets interesting. Because he doesn't leak it to the press.
*  He doesn't do what typical leakers do. Instead, he goes to a small group of friends on a social media
*  platform called Discord that essentially he plays video games with and basically shares this top
*  secret info with just a small group of dudes who like to talk about war and play shooter games.
*  And that's where it started. And remind us the kinds of things he's sharing in particular.
*  Some of this is pretty sensitive stuff. It's briefings on all of the details of the war in Ukraine. So
*  that's the locations of some of the air defenses of Ukraine. It's assessments of how much
*  ammunition the Ukrainians have left and that is running low. And it's other stuff that
*  is really sensitive, including that there are some American special forces on the ground in
*  Ukraine. This is stuff that the United States military would really, really rather have kept quiet.
*  Right. I mean, it's the kind of information that could affect people's lives. It's the kind of
*  information that could perhaps endanger people's lives like those Americans on the ground in Ukraine.
*  And it is stuff that is a crime for him to release. And the leak didn't just stay in Discord.
*  It spills out into other social media to telegram, to Twitter. And eventually it's on the front pages
*  of newspapers all over the world. And it has the attention of the FBI.
*  Right. And it's after all this top secret intelligence hits all these newspapers, including ours,
*  that I think everyone had the exact same question, which is why would such a young
*  national guard airman on a small base in Cape Cod have so much access to so many military secrets?
*  It's a little bit baffling. Exactly. It's not so much the info that was leaked. It's the question,
*  how could such a low level person get their hands on top secret documents? And that's a really
*  interesting story. And it goes back to 9-11. Let's start with the big intelligence question.
*  Everyone keeps asking, how could US intelligence have missed the planning of an operation?
*  This sophisticated, this simultaneous, this multifaceted. If you remember, one of the things that
*  came out in 9-11 is that several intelligence agencies had some idea that an attack was happening.
*  And all of them had little pieces. But at the time, they weren't good at sharing information.
*  I know how this is going to sound, but I have to say it. I didn't think the FBI would know whether or not
*  there was anything going on in the United States by Al Qaeda.
*  In fact, they often were competitive and hidden information from each other. And so even though
*  many agencies had pieces at the puzzle, none of them were able to put pieces together in a way
*  that allowed anyone to act and prevent the terrorist attacks of 2001. I talked to one administration
*  official today. I said, did you have any information about anything like this happening?
*  He said none is all. And that was seen as an intelligence catastrophe.
*  Right. I vividly can remember Dave reading the September 11th commission's final report,
*  which found that there were agencies within the government that had vital intelligence
*  about Al Qaeda, but that it didn't get into the hands of another agency that might have been
*  able to do something about it. And it's not that they said that that would have prevented 9-11,
*  but it would have given our government a fighting chance at trying to stop it.
*  Exactly. And right after those attacks, the intelligence agencies, and this is a big ecosystem,
*  it's 18 federal agencies, including the military, they vowed to get better connected,
*  to share better, to gather more, and to make sure that anyone who had a reasonable amount of
*  security clearance could see it. And so they massively expanded an existing global network
*  that was called J-Wix. That's the joint worldwide intelligence communication system.
*  Fancy name, but basically what it is, is it's like a classified version of Google.
*  A vast number of the intelligence material that is gathered by the Air Force, the Army,
*  the CIA, the FBI, goes into this searchable network. And all of a sudden, this network provided
*  information for anyone with a secure J-Wix terminal from whether they're in Kabul or Cape Cod.
*  So if silent information was the problem before 9-11, J-Wix, this Google of American Intelligence,
*  is going to be a big part of a solution because it's going to force agencies to break those silos
*  down, it's going to force them to share information.
*  Right, but it also comes with a cost because maintaining that takes a vast number of people,
*  many of them low-ranking junior people, to process information, to maintain the network.
*  And all those people need access in order for it to work. And so that number just grows and grows.
*  And today, there's something like 200,000 people that have access to this top secret network.
*  That is an astonishing number of minutes. Basically, the population of a mid-size American city,
*  that's the number of people within our military system who have access to all this sensitive
*  information on J-Wix. Right. And one of the things that the intelligence community is really
*  forced to grapple with is that once you have that many people accessing this huge amount of data,
*  there's a really big danger that there's going to be leaks.
*  And it wasn't too many years after 2001 that those leaks started to happen.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Dave, when does the military first realize in this new post-911 world of intelligence sharing
*  that it has a leak problem? That would be 2010.
*  Julian Assange is at the eye of the storm over the WikiLeaks stockings.
*  But the person who made it all possible is a 23-year-old army private.
*  At that time, there's a army specialist intel analyst, a low-ranking worker bee named Chelsea Manning.
*  This lowly private could read secret cables from American embassies around the world.
*  And she goes into a couple secure networks, including J-Wix, that top secret Google.
*  And she pulls 700,000 military files and diplomatic cables and videos,
*  really sensitive stuff. And she decides that she's not okay with how the war in Iraq is being
*  waged and the public needs to know about it. And so she gives all of that stuff to WikiLeaks.
*  It was the largest leak of military secrets in American history.
*  And that turns out to be just a huge deal. A major embarrassment. Manning faces numerous
*  serious charges, including aiding the enemy. The first leak of its kind really ever,
*  because previous to this system, there was no way that a low-ranking intelligence analyst could
*  get 700,000 documents. So it very quickly showed the intelligence community, okay,
*  we're in a whole new world now. Right. We have enabled this. We didn't mean to, but we have.
*  Right. And so they start making corrections. They make it harder to plug a jump drive in or
*  burn a CD. They start making people leave their cell phones outside of these secure facilities.
*  But it isn't too much longer in 2013 that another relatively low-ranking worker
*  My name is Ed Snowden. Uh, civilian is time named Edward Snowden. Don't know if you remember that name.
*  I do. I'm 29 years old. I work for Booz Allen Hamilton as an infrastructure analyst for NSA
*  in Hawaii. And he takes vast amounts of materials about the NSA's global surveillance system and
*  he shares them with a number of journalists. First, the Guardian revealed the National Security
*  Agency is collecting telephone records of millions of Verizon customers. The NSA monitored phone calls
*  of 35 world leaders. The Guardian revealed the existence of a top secret program code named
*  prison. And so again, the intelligence community is starting to realize, okay, by being more connected,
*  more open, we are more vulnerable to, I mean, pralacab better word like an insider threat.
*  The threat is literally coming from inside the house in both of these cases. This is not an adversary.
*  This is not a breach from overseas. These are people from within the US military system
*  who now have this access, who are creating these leaks. Right. Americans who, for whatever reason,
*  you know, mostly ideological, decide that they see something that they feel needs to be shared.
*  And it doesn't end with Snowden because just a few years later in 2017,
*  a 25 year old woman, a federal contractor with top secret security clearance is in custody in
*  Georgia tonight. A woman named Reality Winner. She's working as a linguist for the NSA as a
*  security contractor and she finds an intelligence report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
*  The classified material and NSA report on a Russian cyber attack on US voting software.
*  And she prints it out, sneaks it out of her secure facility under a close and gives it to the
*  intercept. So in all of these cases, a clear pattern starts to emerge. All the biggest breaches
*  of intelligence, or at least the ones that we know about, are by young, relatively junior people
*  that are working in this vast system. And even though they don't have much authority in this
*  vast organization, they have tremendous access and can essentially spill all this really sensitive
*  information out into the world. And that's exactly the thing that we saw from Jack to share.
*  Dave, we are putting these four leaks in kind of the same bucket, I feel like, but I wonder if we
*  should. I mean, is what Jack to share leaked to his friends on discord? The same as what Edward Snowden
*  leaked to the world, what Chelsea Manning leaked to the world.
*  Right. That's a good question. You know, if you're just looking at the materials,
*  the answers clearly know not only is this a pretty small number of documents, but
*  it largely tells people what they already knew or figured was going on. There's no bombshell
*  in any of this stuff. But the people that I talked to in the intelligence community,
*  they say that it is right to look at him alongside these other leakers because he reveals
*  the same problem with the system, which is if so many people have access to this stuff and there's
*  not really controls on them, you know, there's nothing really preventing another Snowden or another
*  Manning from coming along. And if you believe that what Snowden or Manning did was important or
*  even justified, then obviously that's not necessarily a bad thing. But if you believe as the
*  intelligence community and the justice department certainly does, that those leaks harmed national
*  security. And if you're the military, you're probably asking yourself, should we be rethinking
*  who gets this kind of access? For them, I think the reason Jack to share is such a big deal,
*  is because he's such a small deal. You know, that, you know, a low ranking IT guy at a air
*  national guard base could have such an outsized access to really sensitive stuff. And so they're
*  trying to clamp that down, you know, what they've said publicly this week is that they're calling
*  the list of people that have access to secure networks like J-Wix. They have shut down the intelligence
*  mission for the air base in Massachusetts where to share a word. So they basically shut down his
*  entire unit. That's right. For now. And the Department of Defense has requested that all of its
*  services report within 45 days on what they are doing to make sure that they have the right
*  security and access rules in place so that hopefully this type of thing doesn't happen again.
*  But the problem is is that those restrictions don't come without a cost. You know, the harder it is
*  to share intelligence, the fewer people have access to all this stuff, the more likely it is
*  that you're going to have a failure like the one that we saw in 2001 where you're not sharing
*  intelligence and that creates a big problem. Right. So clearly it's a balancing act. But if we're
*  being honest and maybe if we're being a little provocative, it does not feel Dave as if something
*  like 9-11 is going to happen again just because a 21-year-old airman in Cape Cod working on IT
*  support does not have access to secret military documents. Right. So some of this may be
*  doable without perhaps creating a lot of cost. That's true. But at the same time, the system's
*  going to keep changing and it's going to have new demands, new people that it needs to bring
*  into the circle in order for the intelligence system to work. And it's going to be really hard
*  to make sure that they have access that they need to do their jobs while not granting so much access
*  that they're going to create another big intelligence leak. You know, one of the unique things about
*  the military is that it places enormous amount of responsibility on very young, relatively junior people.
*  I mean, you think about a ground war situation where you might have a platoon leader who's
*  23 years old. And I think that they view this the same way. Like we don't have a choice. We are
*  going to have to continue to give a tremendous amount of responsibility to people who are
*  barely out of college or never even went to college. And I think what they want to do, what they
*  think is one solution is just you know, rely on that these people have the training and
*  character and ethics to understand that they should do the right thing. Right. The military,
*  you're saying, operates on the honor system. Whether that's a drone operator that we trust,
*  knows their target is the right target, whether it's that platoon leader who will be leading
*  fellow young men, perhaps to their deaths. That's the system. That's the contract the military has
*  with the people in it. Right. And the vast majority of time, the vast vast majority of the time,
*  that works. Right. You think about it, but there are sometimes where it all falls apart.
*  Right. I mean, when you think about it, four meaningful leaks of this kind of information since
*  911 might not actually be that many leaks. Right. I mean, that could be like more than a million
*  people who had access to the J. Wicks network in that time. I mean, I'm not saying that the intelligence
*  community would choose to have for leaks, but maybe they see it as a cost of doing business.
*  Well, Dave, we appreciate your time. Thank you very much. Thank you.
*  As of Thursday, Jack Tashera remains in custody in Massachusetts, where he's been charged with
*  violating two federal laws by mishandling classified documents. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years
*  in prison. We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else he need to know day.
*  In its first test flight, SpaceX's Starship, the tallest and most powerful rocket in history,
*  exploded shortly after taking off. We should have had separation by now. Obviously, this does not
*  appear to be a non-noll situation. But experts said that what looked like a failure was in many ways
*  a success because the experimental rocket made it clear of the launch pad and traveled for four
*  minutes. Starship is seen as a technological breakthrough because unlike past rockets,
*  it's designed to be entirely reusable. SpaceX's founder Elon Musk said that the Starship
*  will eventually allow humans to travel to and colonize the planet Mars. And the US military
*  is preparing for the possibility that it will need to evacuate the US Embassy in Sudan.
*  As fighting between two factions of Sudan's military intensifies, so far, the fighting has killed
*  at least 330 people and injured more than 3,000. That violence and its causes will be the subject
*  of Monday's show. Today's episode was produced by Osta Chothervati and Shannon Lidd with help
*  from Michael Simon Johnson. It was edited by MJ Davis Lin and Liz O'Daylin, fat-checked by Susan
*  Lee. Contains original music by Dan Powell and Marian LaZona and was engineered by Chris Wood.
