# Your Car May Be Spying on You
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_avb_9q0S8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  As modern cars become ever more sophisticated pieces of technology, they've begun sharing
*  information about their drivers, sometimes with unnerving consequences.
*  Today, my colleague Kashmir Hill explains what our cars now know and what this means
*  for our lives.
*  It's Monday, March 18th.
*  So Kashmir, you're a data and technology reporter, and you usually come on the show to tell us
*  some very frightening new way that technology is going to affect our lives.
*  This time, though, you're coming on the show to talk about cars.
*  Why cars?
*  Well, like many Americans, during the pandemic, I got a new car.
*  And I hadn't had a car since 1999 when I was in high school.
*  And cars have changed a lot.
*  They've gotten much better.
*  They're more sophisticated.
*  I mean, they're basically computers on wheels.
*  But I know that when you connect things to the internet, it has the ability to record
*  data about you, watch you, potentially spy on you if you don't know what kind of data
*  is being collected and sent out.
*  So you're sitting in this new car looking around thinking, OK, this stuff is probably
*  spying on me.
*  Exactly.
*  And I wondered what kind of data are cars collecting now?
*  And where are they sending it?
*  Who's getting it?
*  I just wanted to know who's tapping into these cars.
*  OK, over here.
*  And this reporting led me to a woman named Christine.
*  My name is Christine Delto Ogden, and I'm from Berger City, Louisiana.
*  Christine is a real estate agent in Louisiana.
*  And for a while, she also sold medical supplies.
*  So her car, a Mercedes, was really important to her work.
*  I had a class C 300, and actually, my car was basically like my roving office.
*  And as a rep in that capacity, you have to live in your car.
*  So it's pretty much like you're home away from home.
*  Christine had been married for 10 years, and her now late husband was a federal agent and
*  abusive.
*  I kind of started losing my independence, I guess you could say.
*  And one night, he got violent with her, and she decided to leave him.
*  She got in her car, and she drove five hours away to where her daughter lived.
*  She ended up filing a police report against her husband for domestic violence.
*  And she did not want to be in contact, but he's texting her.
*  He's calling her.
*  And then he started sending her messages that indicate he knows where she is in real time.
*  And there were a lot of weird incidents, like this one particular incident where she was
*  on a work trip.
*  And I'm sitting in a parking lot.
*  And she was waiting for her colleague in her car.
*  And all of a sudden, he shows up and backs up, rolls his windows down, and is looking
*  at me.
*  He suddenly shows up in the parking lot.
*  Wow.
*  And she had already made sure that he couldn't track her phone.
*  And then she realizes, oh my God.
*  And it just hit me in that moment that it has to be the car.
*  It has to be the car.
*  That the only way it could be happening is that he is tracking her car.
*  And then I started thinking about, well, the only thing that is tied me to this car is
*  going to be that Mercedes app.
*  So her Mercedes was connected to an app Mercedes offers called Mercedes Me.
*  So I get on there, and there's all this information on there that says, you know, you can open
*  your car door.
*  It's one of these connected car apps.
*  You can use it to lock and unlock the vehicle, maybe turn it on remotely.
*  And you can also find out the location of the car.
*  And so that's what her husband was doing.
*  He was tracking the location of the car and thus seeing everywhere she went.
*  I had no idea he was actually watching every move I made.
*  That car was a red light, you know, shining that, oh, she's here.
*  Oh, she's there.
*  He's constantly checking, you know, that app looking to see where I was.
*  We verified that.
*  So what does she do once she has this information?
*  So at this point, she already has a restraining order against him.
*  So she lets the detective on her case know, hey, he's tracking me.
*  And that's when we start calling Mercedes.
*  She calls Mercedes because she wants to get his access to the car, you know, turned off
*  or evoked.
*  She is running into problems because he's the owner of the car.
*  Did they say that the vehicle could be in your name or was it an agreement that the
*  vehicle stays in his name?
*  The title is in his name.
*  And Christine told me it's a decision that they made because he had better credit, but
*  she is the one paying for the car.
*  I've got it in my papers that I have access to the car.
*  I'm the only one that's ever really paid a note on this car.
*  She actually had an order from the judge that had awarded her ownership of the car during
*  divorce proceedings.
*  She had this temporary restraining order.
*  And so she's telling Mercedes, look, I know he's technically the owner of the car, but
*  this is my car.
*  A judge has said this is my car.
*  I have a restraining order against him.
*  He's not supposed to be getting this access to me.
*  Please turn this off.
*  And it's really hard to do anything.
*  And she calls repeatedly.
*  Because I know I can't be the only one that this has happened to.
*  And they can't help her.
*  Crazy.
*  The person who owned the car had the right to be connected to the vehicle.
*  And Mercedes just didn't seem to have any kind of protocol for what to do when this
*  happens.
*  That is really, really remarkable.
*  So what does she do?
*  So she eventually ends up taking the Mercedes to a mechanic.
*  And she pays $400 for him to basically pull the device in the car that provides internet
*  connectivity.
*  So she disconnects her car.
*  And it meant that she lost kind of navigation services in the car.
*  She lost the ability to call roadside assistance.
*  But she didn't care.
*  She said, I just don't want him to be able to track me.
*  It's pretty terrifying, this story, Cash.
*  And I have to say, it's pretty surprising to me that there wasn't a way Mercedes could
*  stop this.
*  What did Mercedes say about this?
*  Mercedes said they could not comment on an individual customer.
*  But this is not just Mercedes.
*  There have been other reports of women this happened to with other car brands with Tesla.
*  The detective in Christine's case, it actually had another case just like this with Alexis.
*  And I think what's really troubling here is that cars are a lifeline for these women.
*  It's literally how they are getting away from abusive situations.
*  But because it's connected to the internet, it's another place where they can be tracked
*  and harassed.
*  And this is the paradox of connected cars.
*  They are no longer private spaces.
*  What do we make about the fact that these cars, they have all this technology that now,
*  as we're seeing, can be exploited.
*  But the car manufacturers don't seem to have anticipated that.
*  Car manufacturers have been making cars for a long time.
*  But they just started making these connected cars really just in the last decade.
*  And car companies, when they have thought about safety, for example, in the past, they're
*  thinking about seat belts.
*  They're not thinking about data security, privacy and harassment, all of these things
*  that happen when you have humans combined with technology.
*  These car companies are so new to this.
*  And I don't think they've kind of worked out the kinks in the way that the Googles and
*  the Facebooks of the world have to the extent that they have.
*  Right.
*  It's just not their thing yet.
*  They have come into this technology space, this digital space, looking around and not
*  practiced it like how to treat data carefully and really what to do with it at all.
*  Exactly. And so these are new problems for car makers, but they're not new problems when
*  it comes to technology.
*  And this was a case of a bad actor invading the privacy of a driver.
*  But as I continued my reporting, I discovered that car companies themselves were invading
*  the privacy of millions of drivers.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Kashmir, you said that these privacy issues in cars actually go beyond individuals exploiting
*  technology, that in fact, you discovered that car companies themselves were invading people's
*  privacy.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Yeah.
*  So for the story about how car apps were being used by abusers, I was spending a lot of time
*  on car forums, places on the Internet where people talk about their cars and their love
*  of cars and their issues with cars on Reddit, on kind of dedicated discussion boards.
*  And I kept seeing the same story over and over again.
*  And it was people whose insurance rates had gone up.
*  And they would ask the insurance agent, why did my insurance go up 20 percent, 50 percent,
*  or why can't I get insurance?
*  And the agent would tell them, you need to pull your LexisNexis report.
*  So LexisNexis, they're basically a big data broker.
*  And LexisNexis has a division called LexisNexis Risk Solutions.
*  And historically, it's kept track of, you know, moving violations, speeding tickets,
*  any accidents you've been in, whether you are at fault or not at fault.
*  And so these people go to LexisNexis, they ask for their files.
*  And when it comes to them, the files are hundreds of pages long.
*  And in them, they are finding information about every trip they have taken in their
*  cars over the previous six months, how far they drove, when the trip started, when the
*  trip ended, how many times they hard-braked, hard-accelerated or sped.
*  These people were shocked.
*  And so they came to the online forum saying, why is this happening?
*  Does anyone know why this is happening?
*  And how do I turn this off?
*  OK, so what's the answer?
*  How was it happening?
*  So, you know, we talked earlier that cars can collect this really detailed data.
*  And that's what was happening.
*  The cars were collecting this data.
*  This was happening to people who drove cars made by General Motors.
*  General Motors was getting this data and then General Motors was giving it to LexisNexis.
*  Wow. OK, so the car company itself was actually just handing it over?
*  Well, I don't think they were just doing it for free.
*  But yes, they were sharing and selling this data.
*  And it wasn't for everybody.
*  It wasn't everybody who drove a GM car that this was happening to.
*  It was happening to a subset of people who had knowingly or unknowingly,
*  in some cases, been enrolled in something called Smart Driver.
*  And what's Smart Driver?
*  So Smart Driver is a feature offered by GM.
*  It's called OnStar Smart Driver.
*  And it's supposed to be a program to help you be a better driver.
*  And you can collect digital badges for being a good driver,
*  like Brake Genius and Speed Limit Hero.
*  And you get some feedback like, take it easy on the brakes, you know,
*  don't speed up so much, make sure you're leaving room in front of your car
*  so you're not going to hit the person in front of you.
*  Like, don't tailgate.
*  So it's a little bit like one of those exercise apps like great job.
*  You ran five miles. Nice braking there. Or on the contrary.
*  Yeah, it was that gamification of real life, right?
*  Like, get a good score, be a good driver.
*  But what people who turned this on didn't realize was that there was something
*  buried in the privacy policy that no one reads
*  that said that they could share that data with third parties.
*  And the third parties that they were sharing it with were LexisNexis
*  and another data broker that works with the insurance industry called Verisk.
*  So some kind of vague fine print lets them turn this driving game
*  into a data harvesting machine, essentially.
*  Yeah. So when I talked to GM, the spokesperson said that people could turn this on
*  in the vehicle app or at the dealership when they bought the car.
*  So it seemed possible that this was quietly being turned on
*  at the dealership by salespeople.
*  And I found this company, Manual, that said that salespeople could earn bonuses
*  from GM by getting drivers to enroll in on-star connected services,
*  including Smart Driver.
*  I mean, there's something kind of creepy about it, right?
*  Like, these people were driving around.
*  They had no idea that every move they made, including when they braked,
*  when they turned, how fast they approached a stop sign,
*  all of that was kind of being watched.
*  It feels like a fundamental violation of privacy in your own car.
*  One of the drivers I talked to said it felt like a betrayal,
*  like he had no idea this information was getting collected
*  and that it would be shared in this way that cost him financially,
*  like his insurance went up.
*  And he said, I'm a safe driver. I've never been in an accident.
*  I don't even kind of understand how they're judging me on this.
*  So it was really confusing to the people this was happening to.
*  And how much were their rates actually going up?
*  Like, give me an example.
*  So one Cadillac driver I talked to in Palm Beach, Florida,
*  said that he actually got denied by seven auto insurance companies.
*  And he wound up paying double what he was paying before for his auto insurance.
*  That is a huge increase. How typical was that?
*  Do you have a sense of that?
*  You know, it's hard to tell.
*  It was just a lot of posts on these different forums.
*  And some people said 20 percent.
*  Some people didn't know how much it affected their insurance.
*  But yet seem to range from I saw 20 percent.
*  I saw 50 percent.
*  And I saw people who said their insurance doubled.
*  And what was the scope here in terms of companies?
*  I mean, was this just GM?
*  So I was only seeing people really explicitly complaining about GM cars.
*  I'd had this experience of my insurance went up.
*  I went to Lexus Nexus. I found my details.
*  But then when I started looking into this, I saw that actually a lot of different
*  automakers are starting to do a form of this.
*  And some of the automakers said, you know, this is about safety.
*  We're trying to help people be better drivers.
*  Often they have like a driver score or driver feedback or road score in their app.
*  And sometimes it's the data broker that's actually giving you the score in the app,
*  not your automaker.
*  OK, so they say it's for safety.
*  Does that explanation hold water?
*  So a version of this has been going on for a long time.
*  There's something called usage based insurance where you with your insurance company say,
*  OK, I'll put a dongle in my car or I'll put your app on my smartphone and I'll let you
*  monitor my driving.
*  And those programs have actually been quite successful.
*  Like I talked to one expert and he says that when people are knowingly doing this, being
*  observed, that the impact on safety is enormous, that, you know, these people become better
*  drivers. But that doesn't work if you don't know that you're enrolled in this program.
*  If you don't know that how you drive is going to impact your insurance, then you're not
*  going to improve your driving. There's no there's no safety benefit here.
*  At the same time, there's this question of what does this data even mean?
*  What is what is heartbreaking?
*  What is hard acceleration?
*  How does it reflect how risky a driver you are?
*  I was actually thinking about this a couple of days ago because I was driving home late at
*  night and a herd of deer just suddenly sprinted across the road and I had to slam on the
*  brakes and I saved my car insurance company a bunch of money because I didn't hit the
*  deer and damage my car.
*  But I wonder in the data, do I look like a terrible driver who is tailgating somebody
*  and then had to slam on the brakes?
*  I mean, back to your point earlier in the show, right, these car companies are kind of
*  tech companies in training, right.
*  And and I imagine that they will soon learn some of the lessons that other tech companies
*  have had to learn, which is surveilling your customers, collecting troves of data that
*  doesn't go unnoticed for long periods of time.
*  I mean, it will have a response.
*  People are not happy about this.
*  And I've been watching those.
*  I'm still in those online car forums and I see people reacting to this story and they're
*  saying, oh, my God, I just checked my app and I'm signed up for this.
*  I can't believe it.
*  They're saying I'm not going to buy a GM car.
*  I'm not going to buy any of the cars that are mentioned in this article.
*  But the thing is, there's there's lots of different automakers that are doing this.
*  I talked to Senator Ed Markey about this.
*  Senator from Massachusetts, Senator from Massachusetts.
*  He's been talking to car makers, asking them, what data are you collecting about people?
*  Who are you sharing it with?
*  And they had sent him some very evasive answers.
*  But he said when I described to him what was happening with GM, he said, that sounds like
*  a violation of the law that protects consumers against unfair and deceptive business
*  practices. And a couple of days after my story came out, there was a class action
*  lawsuit filed against General Motors and Lexus Nexus in the Southern District of
*  Florida. So this is really a moving target in terms of, you know, in a way, a new social
*  problem. I mean, you started digging into the privacy implications of these cars and
*  you found pretty quickly two very egregious examples of ways car drivers privacy is
*  being violated, which kind of makes me wonder, you know, what else is going on with these
*  cars that we don't even know about yet?
*  Right. Honestly, this is why I have been seeing in the last decade or so I've been
*  reporting on privacy and data collection.
*  At first, I was writing about Facebook and Google, but now everything is Internet
*  connected. It's not just cars.
*  So many of the products we get your TV, your vacuum, sometimes your bed, your toothbrush,
*  like they want to put a Wi-Fi connection on everything.
*  And it can be really convenient.
*  It can give us information remotely.
*  You know, we can turn things on and off our lights.
*  But once you have this Internet connection, it means people can get at these devices
*  who previously couldn't.
*  And it means that things that don't look like a camera, that don't look like a
*  recording device are they're watching you and they're gathering information about
*  you. And it's this big question of who's getting it and how is it going to be used?
*  Kashmir, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me on, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  In a highly anticipated ruling, a judge overseeing the election interference case
*  against Donald Trump and his allies in Georgia decided on Friday that the Fulton County
*  District Attorney, Fonny Willis, could remain in charge of the prosecution, but only if
*  her former romantic partner withdrew from the case.
*  The ruling essentially meant the case against Trump and his allies in Georgia could
*  proceed since the judge could have removed her and her entire office from the
*  prosecution, but chose not to.
*  The decision revolved around a defendant's claim that Willis should be disqualified
*  because her romance with her office's lead lawyer, Nathan Wade, had given her an
*  inappropriate financial stake in prosecuting Trump.
*  Within hours of the ruling, Wade resigned from the case.
*  But even as the judge spared Willis, he refused to fully vindicate her.
*  The ruling described her decision to date Wade and take multiple vacations with him
*  as, quote, a tremendous lapse in judgment that had raised a significant appearance of
*  impropriety.
*  And in Russia, Vladimir Putin garnered 88 percent of the vote in the presidential
*  election held this weekend, according to Russian election authorities.
*  His win was a foregone conclusion, as the Kremlin had blocked any real competition.
*  In a quiet show of opposition, Russians formed long lines at polling stations in
*  several major cities at noon on Sunday.
*  At the request of the team of the now deceased opposition leader, Alexei Navalny.
*  If Putin serves to 2030, the end of his new term, he will have the longest tenure of
*  any Russian leader since Catherine the Great in the late 1700s.
