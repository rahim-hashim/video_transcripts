*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverni-C, and this is the Daily.
*  The relationship between two Democratic allies fell to its lowest point in history this
*  week, after Canada accused India of being involved in the assassination of a Canadian citizen
*  on Canadian soil.
*  Today, my colleague, South Asia Bureau Chief, Majid Michal, on this stunning allegation,
*  and on what India's reaction tells us about the era of its leader, Narendra Murri.
*  It's Thursday, September 21st.
*  So, would you tell me about the accusations that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
*  made on Monday?
*  Prime Minister Trudeau got on the floor of the Parliament Monday afternoon.
*  Mr. Speaker, today I'm rising to inform the House of an extremely serious matter.
*  And he said he had something very serious to share.
*  After the past number of weeks, Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible
*  allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing
*  of a Canadian citizen.
*  That his government had information linking agents of the Indian government with a killing
*  of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.
*  And he named the individual.
*  Mr. Deep Singh Najar.
*  How deep Singh Najar?
*  It is contrary to the fundamental rules by which free, open, and democratic societies conduct
*  themselves.
*  And Trudeau was very visibly incensed and he made clear that this was an issue the Canadian
*  government was taking very, very seriously, that it was a matter of a breach of Canada's
*  sovereignty.
*  In the strongest possible terms, I continue to urge the government of India to cooperate
*  with Canada to get to the bottom of this matter.
*  And this was a hugely explosive moment because here was the Prime Minister of Canada leveling
*  a huge accusation against one of its allies.
*  Right.
*  The leader of one democracy accusing another democracy of a killing like this.
*  It just doesn't happen.
*  Usually if a state wants to get someone in another democracy, they go through legal channels.
*  They ask that state to extradite the person.
*  They don't just go into another democracy's territory and kill someone because that would
*  just be incredibly destabilizing for the world.
*  It's rare.
*  It's very rare and it's associated with governments that are not seen as democratic.
*  And it has definitely not been associated with India and with India's security agencies.
*  So the fact that the accusation came from the highest level of the Canadian government,
*  that this was the Prime Minister of Canada putting his own face on this accusation and making
*  the accusation from the floor of the parliament, made clear how big of a deal this is and
*  how much is at stake in the relationship between these two countries.
*  So what do we know about what Trudeau is alleging here?
*  I mean, what details do we have about this killing?
*  So the details are very, very limited.
*  What we know is that in June, Mr. Najar was in the parking lot of this temple he was associated
*  with.
*  And two masked gunmen came up to him and shot him and that the masked gunmen then got
*  away in a vehicle.
*  And Mr. Najar was dead.
*  Obviously, it caused a shock in his community and there were reactions to his murder.
*  But whether it was a political killing or anything else remained a mystery at the time.
*  So Trudeau's speech this week was the first time we heard a formal allegation.
*  And what do we know about this man that Trudeau says the Indian government helped kill?
*  We know that he was 45 years old, that he had moved from the Indian state of Punjab to
*  Canada in 1990s and that at some point during his time in Canada after he settled there,
*  he worked as a plumber that he was very heavily involved in his local Sikh community and that
*  in 2020 he actually became the head of a local Sikh temple in Suri in British Columbia.
*  And so he was clear that he had some stature in his community there and that he was very
*  involved in advocacy but that advocacy that he was involved, the Indian government actually
*  sees that as terrorism.
*  Oh wow.
*  Okay, so talk to me about that.
*  So the cause that Mr. Najar was advocating for is called Khalistan which is basically the
*  creation of a country, an independent country for the Sikhs from what is the Indian state
*  of Punjab.
*  And this cause has been around for decades actually it goes back to the moment that India
*  was partitioned when the British colonial rule ended.
*  India was divided into a nation for the Muslims which became Pakistan and the Sikhs in Punjab.
*  They stood up and sections of the Sikhs stood up and said we want similarly another country
*  along religious lines for ourselves called Khalistan and the Sikhs are a religious minority
*  in India but in this one state in Punjab there are majority.
*  So they wanted to turn Punjab into an independent nation called Khalistan and that wasn't something
*  that they got at the time but this cause remained as an insurgency and it climaxed in a very
*  violent period in the 1980s in Punjab.
*  And what happened in the 1980s?
*  So the advocates of Khalistan grew bolder in the 1980s.
*  A group of armed Khalistan militants moved into the golden temple which is the holiest
*  site of Sikhism in Punjab.
*  And they barricaded themselves in there and Indra Gandhi who was a prime minister, she
*  was known as the Iron Lady of India and for Mrs. Gandhi's government that was in a front
*  that she wanted to crush and so she sent in the commandos to clear them from the temple.
*  From a distance an uneasy calm appeared to have settled over the golden temple but close
*  up the effects of the 10 days siege between Sikh extremists and soldiers were apparent.
*  But that resulted in hundreds of people dead inside the temple.
*  Two corpses had to be retrieved from the sacred lake which was now being drained and rebuilt.
*  And that really incensed a lot of the wider Sikh population.
*  And the feeling was that Mrs. Gandhi had used disproportionate violence in how she cracked
*  down on that and that her government had moved against the wider Sikh population rather
*  than this small extreme minority that wanted independent country.
*  And as she was on her way one morning leaving her residence to her office to Sikh bodyguards
*  basically stepped in and shot her dead.
*  As the country started 12 official days of mourning violence mixed with grief.
*  And that unleashed a period of widespread indiscriminate violence against Sikhs in India.
*  Scores of cars belonging to Sikhs were burned.
*  These taxi drivers in Delhi are Sikhs proving easy targets for angered Hindus.
*  And the ruling party at the time the Congress party was complicit in this because they made
*  it clear that this was revenge for the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi and it was pogroms basically
*  in Sikh neighborhoods.
*  All the men in the houses were dragged out, knifeed and set on fire.
*  Those who resisted were hacked to pieces.
*  The army is out in force trying to keep what peace they can in a city and country sliding
*  periscocy close to civil war.
*  And that period of the 80s has remained a wound that the community carries.
*  So there's this explosive period of violence against ordinary Sikhs, people who had nothing
*  to do with the political demands of the movement.
*  What happens with the movement after that?
*  Well the movement is actually largely crushed in India and in Punjab in particular.
*  But what we see in that period also is a increased migration out of India because on the one hand
*  India's economy was struggling at that time.
*  So there's a lot of economic migration.
*  But a lot of the Sikhs from Punjab leave with this wound that the Indian state was prejudiced
*  against them.
*  So a large number of Sikhs start settling in countries like Australia, the US, the UK,
*  but particularly in Canada because the Canadians had changed their immigration laws that
*  had become much more open I think since the late 60s and 70s.
*  So a large number of Sikhs settle in Canada to a point that Canada is the second place
*  after India with the largest Sikh population in the world.
*  Wow.
*  So what happened was that although this cause of separatism was squashed in India, the sentiment
*  remained alive in these diasporas among parts of the Sikh community that settled there.
*  So Nijar is an example of this.
*  He moved to Canada in the 1990s.
*  He was a leader in the Sikh community and supported the creation of an independent state.
*  So what was he actually doing to further that?
*  So one of the main things that he was involved in was this idea of a referendum for Pakistan.
*  So this is basically a vote on Canadian soil for the creation of a nation out of a piece
*  of India.
*  There's no bearer on the ground in India.
*  But it was basically a tactic to try to keep as many Sikhs interested in this idea of
*  an independent nation as possible, to get them to actually to a ballot box to vote for
*  this imagined nation.
*  Right.
*  And so when the Canadians are seeing his activities, they see a man running around with pamphlets
*  and organizing and mobilizing voters.
*  Most of it sort of feels underprotected speech in Canada.
*  Right.
*  He's just doing vote activity.
*  He's just doing vote activity, yes, for an idea that is separatism, but it's an idea.
*  Right.
*  But what the Indian Sea is not just a non-violent protest movement for this cause, they see a
*  movement that is tied to a lot of violence.
*  In fact, in the 1980s, it was members of this movement that blew up an air-India flight
*  that had taken off from Canada and was flying the London midair and causing the deaths
*  of more than 300 people.
*  And people like Mr. Najar and more recent years, the Indian government have accused him of
*  having roles in violence and bombings and killings in India.
*  The Indian officials say that we've expressed this to Canadians repeatedly to a point that
*  a couple years ago, the Indians declared a materist and that they had wanted his
*  extradition from the Canadian government.
*  So it was two different narratives around the same men.
*  So I guess it kind of makes sense why Trudeau would have suspected India of killing Najar,
*  but did Trudeau offer any proof that it actually was India?
*  Like when he gave his announcement in Parliament, what evidence did he show?
*  So that's where the problem is he didn't offer any details.
*  There's been no proof for evidence that's been offered publicly.
*  And India has unequivocally denied this.
*  They said this is not what we do.
*  But they're also saying that there are terrorists, that there are terror sympathizers on Canadian
*  grounds and the Canadian government is not taking any action.
*  So this has all caused this diplomatic role now where the Canadians expelled a senior Indian
*  diplomat and reaction the Indians expelled a senior Canadian diplomat and trade ties between
*  the two countries have been paused.
*  There are travel advisories flying left and right and the relationship between these
*  two countries is the lowest it's ever been.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So when you described India's response to Trudeau's allegation, which was essentially
*  denying it, they're saying absolutely this was not us.
*  But at the same time, they're saying Canada is sheltering terrorists.
*  So what does that dual response reveal about India in this moment?
*  In many ways it's a reflection of the domestic politics in this country.
*  Prime Minister Modi has projected this image of a strong man protector of the country.
*  To do that, you usually need a threat that you're protecting the country against.
*  And that's been very beneficial to him in 2019 when he was struggling politically, what
*  helped him gain a sweeping victory was this bombing that happened in Kashmir and it was
*  tied to Pakistan and he created a whole nationalist movement against that and he won sweeping
*  strongly.
*  So his solid position at the top has as much dependent on protecting against threats
*  and Palestine, this idea of Palestine fits nicely in that as well.
*  We've seen in the past two or three years, it's actually come very handy that in the
*  biggest political challenge Mr. Modi faced in his 10 years in power was this farmer's
*  protest.
*  The majority of those farmers were Sikhs from Punjab.
*  They were just average citizens of India protesting against a farm bill that they didn't agree
*  with.
*  But when Mr. Modi's officials did was often they labeled those farmers as halistani's,
*  essentially as separatist terrorists.
*  So it left the sense that sometimes the government wants to stoke the extent of this threat because
*  it feeds into the political need of a threat to protect against.
*  And now as this episode plays up, there's an election coming up in a few months where Mr.
*  Modi is seeking a third term and it increasingly appears that in the election season, this
*  will be a conversation as well.
*  But what you know is accusing Modi's government of is not using rhetoric to excite his base.
*  He's accusing Modi's government of murder, of killing a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.
*  Absolutely.
*  But the accusation of this violence doesn't actually put off Modi's supporters in how it plays
*  out in the domestic politics here.
*  And why is that?
*  Because the Hindu nationalist vision that has brought Modi to power, in that vision there
*  is this idea that for a long time, because of Muslim invasions, because of the British colonial
*  rule, Hindus were emasculated in this country.
*  Now that they've had a chance to reshape this country, that needs to be a strong vision
*  where violence actually does have a role, that you do use violence to pursue your goals
*  and to show strength.
*  Modi embodies that personally in how he projects that strength, but using violence as a tool
*  for power is very clearly vocalized in that vision.
*  That this accusation that Modi's government may have done this, if anything, would help
*  politically rather than hurt.
*  So you're saying that Modi isn't actually facing any repercussions domestically because
*  the accusation of violence itself doesn't hurt Modi.
*  If one was to read the reaction over the past couple of days in the domestic debate here,
*  that is exactly the point you would be left with.
*  That that violence doesn't hurt him, that violence further cements his image of a strong man
*  who would use any tool to protect this country.
*  But what about the response outside of India?
*  What about India's Western allies say?
*  Isn't there a risk that this could cause some response on their part?
*  Sanctions, punishment of some sort?
*  Well actually the response has been pretty muted.
*  Even among these countries known as the Five Eyes, essentially partners of Canada that
*  Canada shares intelligence with the United States, Australia, the UK.
*  And we thought that at least the Canadians would have shared the evidence they have, but
*  those countries would see a strong reaction.
*  Their reaction has been muted as well.
*  They've been saying we are concerned, but we'll see where the investigations lead.
*  They're not coming out as unequivocally as Canada would have hoped.
*  And a large part of that reason is from the US to the UK to France and Germany, everybody's
*  trying to court India.
*  In this moment of huge tensions with China, the West has been looking to India as sort
*  of a counterbalance.
*  And that need is so massive that a lot of these Western powers have been looking away from
*  some of the things that India has been doing.
*  So that has created the sense of confidence for India that we are so indispensable, not
*  just because of that counterbalance to China, but also because of a rise as a large economy
*  that we can get away with a lot.
*  That a lot of things that would ruffle feathers in the past might not do so anymore.
*  And how muted the response of some of these Canadian allies have been over the past couple
*  days only plays into that Indian confidence more.
*  I mean, listening to you talk about this, it also sounds like Canada's Prime Minister
*  Trudeau is kind of out on his own here.
*  No one's coming out and supporting him.
*  He's alone.
*  Absolutely.
*  And this will test how far Prime Minister Trudeau pushes it because he's put his reputation
*  on the line.
*  And his convincing powers of how much he can rally his allies will be tested here because
*  the Indian pushback has been very obvious.
*  There hasn't been a sign that the Indian government wants to cooperate in the face of
*  such a major accusation.
*  So now that Prime Minister Trudeau has gone all out with it is a test of what can you
*  really achieve with it.
*  So stepping back here, investigations like this, of course, can take years and we may
*  never know the answer to whether India was behind the killing.
*  But in some ways Modi may have just learned that in effect, he could get away with it,
*  but the wrath of what the Western allies would not come crashing down on him because of
*  where India is in the world right now.
*  It's economic promise.
*  It's counterbalance to China.
*  These things in some ways give it a kind of get out of jail free card.
*  Exactly.
*  And even this moment of pushing back against Canada's accusation is almost being seen in
*  India by the India government as a way of proving your strength at the world stage right now.
*  And we are positioned so strongly with ties to the powers that we can get away with anything.
*  This may be overcoming an accusation or it may be actually a hand in committing a murder.
*  We don't know which one it is, but even overcoming this Canadian accusation is being used as
*  a point of showing strength.
*  Mishib, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should note today.
*  I'm wondering this.
*  Garland, who was repeatedly interrupted by Republicans as he testified, told them that his
*  office has never interfered in the Hunter Biden investigation and has followed the letter
*  of the law in its prosecution of former President Trump.
*  I am not the president's lawyer.
*  I will add I am not Congress's prosecutor.
*  Justice Department works for the American people.
*  Our job is to follow the facts and the law and that is what we do.
*  And with COVID infections on the rise, the Biden administration will spend $600 million
*  to revive a program that offers free COVID tests through the mail.
*  Starting on Monday of next week, every American household can begin requesting up to four
*  tests at COVIDtests.gov.
