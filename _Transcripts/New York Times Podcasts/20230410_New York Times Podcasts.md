# An Extraordinary Act of Political Retribution in Tennessee

*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tevernice and this is The Daily.
*  In a stunning act of political retribution, Tennessee's Republican-controlled House,
*  last week, expelled two of its members, both young black Democrats.
*  Today, my colleague Emily Cochran, on the story behind that extraordinary move,
*  and what it tells us about this moment in American politics.
*  It's Monday, April 10th.
*  So, Emily, you're in Tennessee where we saw this really remarkable vote in the state house on
*  Thursday. Tell us what happened. So, the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to
*  expel two lawmakers from the chamber. These two men, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson are two
*  relatively new young black legislators who represent parts of the state's biggest cities,
*  Nashville and Memphis. This type of thing is incredibly rare. Since the Civil War era,
*  it's only happened two times in Tennessee. Typically, those expulsions have involved some
*  sort of an investigation, a lawmaker who faced criminal charges or accusations of sexual misconduct.
*  It's not something done lightly. But that wasn't what was going on here. There was no criminal
*  misconduct. So, what was going on in this case, Emily? Why exactly were these two lawmakers expelled?
*  So, it came after they led a protest on the House floor. I think this has a lot to do with an
*  intensifying political divide between blue cities and red states like Tennessee. Over time,
*  the states, larger cities, Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, they have remained defiantly blue,
*  even as the rest of the state has gotten increasingly conservative and taken increasingly
*  hard-line positions. And that tension is what we saw essentially blow up this week in Tennessee.
*  Right. These little blue dots in the sea of red, right? So, let's talk about that. Give me a sense
*  of what those political changes have looked like in Tennessee. So, it's similar to what we have
*  seen in other states nationally, right? This used to be a state that was somewhat mixed politically.
*  But it's become increasingly more conservative, voting for every Republican candidate in a
*  presidential election since the 90s. You know, in 2020, 60% of the vote went for Donald Trump,
*  Billy, the Republican governor, one handily. So, Republicans have dominated state politics,
*  and it's allowed them in the last few months to pass and propose a bunch of bills on
*  culture war issues. And there's a super majority in the legislature. So, we've seen a lot of
*  legislation targeting the rights of LGBTQ people in this state. Gun laws have steadily weakened.
*  And abortion access is non-existent after the fall of Roe.
*  And Emily, what about the cities? Talk to me about how those have changed.
*  So, the cities in Tennessee are some of the fastest growing urban areas in the country. You've
*  had an influx of tech workers, immigrants, all kinds of people coming from out of state and moving
*  here to the cities. And I think with that, you've also seen a stronger progressive base in the city.
*  They are electing more liberal Democrats. And as Republicans push through more conservative
*  policies, it's getting harder and harder for Democrats to see how to be friends with people
*  who are trying to take away access to health care for their children. And clamping down on social
*  issues that are really important to them. And then another deadly school shooting in America,
*  this time at a Christian school in Nashville. Two weeks ago, there's a mass shooting.
*  The suspect identified as a 28-year-old former student shot and killed three young children
*  and three adults before being killed by police. It shocks a very close-knit church community.
*  And a lot of people in Nashville are grieving. These parents, their lives are changed forever today.
*  I mean, we got three nine-year-old babies that aren't going to make it home tonight.
*  And then it brings us to a familiar place politically.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this can happen anywhere. It happened here today. But unless we take action,
*  it's going to happen again. Where there's an immediate push for gun restrictions.
*  I didn't have one person ask me for thoughts and prayers today. They ask me for courage to come
*  down here and do something. And Republicans make it clear that their focus is not going to be on guns.
*  I believe that we ought to have an armed guard in every school in Tennessee.
*  But it's going to be on toughening school security.
*  $140 million dollars for public schools to hire SROs and highly trained guards.
*  There is no excuse to not have a guard at every school.
*  Pouring millions of dollars into school resource officers and
*  stricter security protocols at public and private schools.
*  And in the days after the shooting.
*  Hundreds of people marched to the state legislature rally at the Capitol.
*  I really just want to fight for gun control because I'm tired of my life being put second
*  to fire arm. Students, parents and teachers demand that the legislature take action to tough
*  and gun laws. We just don't have a government here in Tennessee that's willing to do anything about
*  gun laws.
*  And in the middle of all these protests, that's when we first hear about three Democratic
*  representatives, Justin Jones, Justin Pearson, and a woman from Knoxville named Gloria Johnson.
*  So tell me more about these three lawmakers. Who are they?
*  So Justin Jones and Justin Pearson are some of the youngest members of the House.
*  They're both in their late 20s. They're both black community organizers who have recently been
*  elevated from being familiar faces, incidents and protests to the legislature to a position of power.
*  Jones won his election in the November midterms to represent parts of Nashville.
*  This came after he led a 61-day protest for racial justice outside the state Capitol
*  in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd in 2020. So he is a familiar face to lawmakers and
*  a thorn in the side of this Republican majority.
*  Interesting. So what about Pearson?
*  So he won a special election in January to represent parts of Memphis.
*  He helped lead a successful campaign against the construction of a crude oil pipeline that would
*  have cut through a mostly black neighborhood in Memphis. And even in the few weeks that he's
*  been in the legislature, he's also emerged as one of the most outspoken members, especially after
*  tragedies like the killing of Tyree Nichols in Memphis.
*  So in other words, a younger generation of Democrat, as you say, much more progressive
*  and coming directly out of the activism and energy that followed the killing of George Floyd
*  in 2020. What about the third lawmaker?
*  So Gloria Johnson is a white lawmaker from Knoxville. She's a retired teacher and she's been
*  serving on the legislature on and off for the last 10 years. She has talked a lot about how
*  gun violence affected her personally as a teacher when there was a fatal shooting on her school campus.
*  And in fact, all three of them have been very open about how their lives and their activism
*  brought them to politics. So what do the three lawmakers do as protests erupt in the Tennessee
*  legislature? So last Thursday, days after the shooting, protesters have again packed the building,
*  packed the galleries of the chamber. And Republicans are proceeding with legislation as usual.
*  This bill is designed to help a small community in my district that missed a deadline to have
*  their wine and grocery store referendum. And every time one of these Democrats tries to pivot the
*  debate. I want to start with we need to do something about gun control. To turn the debate to
*  gun control, to an acknowledgement of the hundreds of people in the building.
*  Representative Harrison stay on the bill. I don't want to have to start rolling out a order again.
*  Their microphones are turned off and they're told to stay on topic. Representative Harrison,
*  thank you. Again, we need to do something about gun control.
*  Representative Harrison, this is your last warning. Either stay on the bill or you will not be called
*  on. This is your last warning. I'm asking you politely to stay on the bill. So eventually,
*  they get up, they walk to the front of the room, which is what people call the well of the chamber.
*  They have a megaphone, they have a sign that says protect kids, not guns.
*  And they begin to lead the protesters in chance.
*  People, not to the NRA, not to our believes that allow us to be silent in the face of injustice,
*  power to the people. And the entire proceeding grinds to a halt.
*  They literally are stopping the proceeding with a bullhorn. Right. And there are cheering on these
*  protesters encouraging them. We can never quit. That's what they're saying. But each and every one
*  of you are proud that we will not be silent. It's a thank you for being here. They call
*  your college for being here. You are being heard and listened to as we will not quit.
*  And the house goes into recess because Republicans don't know what to do and they're scrambling
*  to regain control of the day. By the time the whole thing ends, it's about 40 to 50 minutes.
*  But it's clear Republicans are furious about what has just happened. The speaker of the house,
*  Cameron Sexton, goes so far as to compare what happened to the violent riot on January 6, 2021.
*  Wow. Which was a completely different moment. This was just a few minutes. And this wasn't
*  an effort to overturn something, to overturn the will of the voters. This was an effort to bring
*  attention to an issue that Republicans aren't really comfortable addressing right now.
*  So those comments alone make it pretty clear that there's going to be some form of punishment
*  for what happened. And by Monday, Republicans have stripped the three Democrats of their committee
*  assignments and they've taken away their ID access, you know, the ability to get into the garage
*  and get into the building after hours. They're saying that the lawmakers have committed a breach
*  of decorum. They broke the house rules about where, when, and how you're allowed to speak on the
*  house floor and they interrupted proceedings. And remember, Republicans have a super majority.
*  So the big thing they do is move to call for a vote to expel these lawmakers from the house.
*  And that's what you see play out on the floor on Thursday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Emily, take us to the floor of the House Chamber on Thursday when Republicans make the case that
*  these Democratic lawmakers should be expelled. So once again, hundreds of people descend upon the
*  Capitol this time in defense of the three lawmakers now known as the Tennessee three.
*  And the Republicans bring up the three resolutions for a vote.
*  One week ago, we had members taken upon themselves to rush the well and stop the people's business.
*  It essentially feels like a trial.
*  We have an obligation to protect the integrity of this body.
*  The Republican argument boils down to they knowingly violated the House rules.
*  They tried to shred our Constitution with a bullhorn.
*  They spoke out of turn to have insulted this body. You have insulted your colleagues.
*  They disrupted the proceedings.
*  Members that shut the order of this institution down silenced seven million people.
*  And there should be consequences for that.
*  Mr. Speaker, I represent 78,000 people.
*  And when I came to the well that day, I was not standing for myself,
*  but I was standing for my constituents.
*  And each of the lawmakers, one by one, has a chance to defend themselves and explain why
*  their actions don't merit exposure from the body.
*  I hear a lot of talk about caring about children, but I continue to hear no one having conversations
*  about things that will prevent gun violence from coming to our doors.
*  And the really striking thing was when the three Democrats themselves, after days of arguing that
*  they hadn't had the opportunity to draw attention to the protests, to talk about gun control,
*  essentially have an open floor to do so.
*  But there is something that tells me it is not the rules being broken. It was what we were advocating for
*  that folks have gotten very upset about. We were advocating for people who have been murdered
*  in our communities. We hear from Justin Pearson. He talks about how he believes their
*  expulsion isn't really about the fact that they violated a house rule and in a really powerful speech.
*  In a country that was built on a protest.
*  He talks about how this country was built on protest.
*  You say to protest is wrong because you spoke out of turn, because you spoke up for people who are
*  marginalized. You spoke up for children who won't ever be able to speak again. You spoke up for
*  parents who don't want to live in fear. You spoke up for for Larry Thorn who was murdered by gun
*  violence. You spoke up for people that we don't want to care about.
*  And that's something you also hear from Jones who is a divinity scholar. He invokes
*  Bible verses. He talks about how he was representing his constituents.
*  This is not a temple. This is a place where we're supposed to wrestle for our democracy and
*  wrestle ideas and get voice to 78,000 constituents each of us represents.
*  In a Republican-dominated legislature that has other priorities that doesn't agree with this push
*  to restrict gun access. He saw an opportunity to make sure that his constituents were still being
*  heard against the odds. What we see today is just as spectacle. What we see today is a lynched mob
*  assembled to not lynch me but our democratic process. Knowing that the Republicans easily have
*  the votes to expel him, he condemns the whole process as a farce of democracy.
*  Emily, what about Johnson? What does she say? So she comes with two attorneys and they make a more
*  traditional case about her actions, about how she didn't yell. She didn't hold the megaphone.
*  And it's a more of a typical court proceeding. But what I was struck by was she also takes a moment
*  in her closing remarks to plead with her colleagues to acknowledge and to accept the new generation.
*  We have to welcome this younger generation who might do it a little bit differently,
*  but they are fighting like hell for their constituents and that's what they sent them here for.
*  That's what they're doing. It's going to look different. You guys, the next generation always does.
*  And it's an acknowledgement of how she's in a different position than the two of them.
*  Isn't it true that approximately at 1049, last Thursday,
*  the representative Johnson, representative Pearson and you gathered at representative Johnson's
*  desk at approximately 1049, last Thursday?
*  The representative Jones, yes, that's what you're talking about.
*  Over the course of the debate for each of these three resolutions, the Republicans
*  keep the debate going by asking these really pointed questions about what they did and why they did it
*  and how they did it and did they know that they were breaking the rules.
*  And do you understand to speak from the will as you are speaking today, you are able to speak
*  because Speaker Sexton recognized you in the will to be able to speak.
*  Representative Jones, thank you. I'm able to speak because the people of District 52 sent me here
*  to speak. Speaker Sexton is not my constituent. Speaker Sexton is not a king. Speaker Sexton is not
*  God though he may want to be. He is my colleague. As this back and forth continues,
*  the questions grow increasingly combative and it becomes particularly stark.
*  There is a generational and a racial divide between the two adjustments as they become known.
*  And these Republican lawmakers just because you don't get your way. You can't come to the well,
*  bring your friends and throw a temper tantrum with an adolescent bullhorn. That's why you're standing
*  there because of that temper tantrum that day. Speaker Sexton There are accused of temper tantrums.
*  They're questioned about why they don't want to get along. Speaker Sexton Does it not matter to you,
*  you shut down every other voice and elevated yourself even above the very families who were going
*  through hell because their loved ones were killed and it appeared to us as if in that
*  brooch of protocol. It's not about the rules. It's about that you elevated yourself above the very
*  dead bodies that had not been put in the ground yet. Speaker Sexton And it's hard not to see a difference
*  in how these two men are treated by this predominantly white Republican legislature.
*  All right, we are voting on the House of Resolution 65. All those in favor vote I when the
*  Bill rings those opposed vote no. First it's Justin Jones. He is the first to see a vote.
*  Presumint to Article 2 Section 12 of the Constitution of State Tennessee, I hear by the
*  Clerk Representative Justin Jones of the 57 Representative District expelled from the House of
*  Represumintors of the 113th Assembly of the State of Tennessee. And he is expelled with a supermajority.
*  Only one Republican breaks party lines to vote against this. We are voting on House Resolution 64.
*  And then it's Johnson's turn. I 65 30 nays. House Resolution 64 fails.
*  And she actually gets 65 votes, which means the resolution failed by one vote. Wow. And she keeps her
*  seat. Outside you can hear people chanting her name. Everyone is surprised.
*  This is out of order. Out of order. But then it turns back to Justin Pearson.
*  Hi 69 26 nays. And Justin Pearson is also expelled. House Resolution 63 is hereby adopted with
*  objection the most in Greek service table. Presumint to Article 2 Section 12 of the Constitution of
*  State Tennessee. I hear by the Clerk Representative Justin J. Pearson of the 86 Representative District
*  expelled from the House of Represumintors of the 113rd General Assembly of the State of Tennessee.
*  Next order Mr. Clerk. And as it happens, the final vote, it's like the hall of the legislature
*  explodes. Protesters who had largely been quiet the whole day to avoid getting kicked out of
*  gallery just start chanting and screaming. It's deafening these calls of shame on you over and over
*  again. The anger is palpable. So Jones and Pearson are expelled. But what have the events
*  of the last few days meant for them? It's been pretty remarkable honestly. These are two
*  state legislators who have now been elevated to a national profile given the opportunity
*  with the eyes of the nation on them, all kinds of national media watching to preach about gun violence,
*  the need to restrict gun access racism in their state and their support for these young protesters.
*  And now you've seen everyone from former President Barack Obama, President Biden, all of these
*  national Democrats weigh in, talk about how unfair and undemocratic this was, circulate fundraising
*  links, they've raised thousands of dollars in the day since. I mean respectfully, I don't think a lot
*  of people outside of the state of Tennessee would have necessarily known about them. And here we are.
*  But what at a practical level will happen to them? So there's a very real possibility this
*  ends with them back in the state legislature. Really? How? So under the rules governing this whole
*  process, the governing bodies in their counties can appoint someone to fill the seat
*  until a special election. And in Nashville, it seems pretty clear that there are the votes
*  to name Jones back to that open seat as early as Monday. Oh my gosh. And it's likely that
*  both men will run again for their seats and they will do so now with a war chest filled with
*  donations from appreciative voters across the country. So Emily, I'm listening to your telling
*  of this story and thinking really, you know, this did not go that badly for these lawmakers.
*  On the contrary, it raised their national profile. They now have a war chest. And you know, in some
*  ways, I don't know, to me, it looks like own goal for Republicans, right? This kind of backfired.
*  I think that's why a lot of people in this state, a lot of political observers are almost
*  bewildered about why the Republicans chose to pick this fight and chose to give them this kind
*  of platform. I will say the conservative base is pretty happy with what happened. And in a state
*  where quite frankly, the majority of elections are now decided in Republican primaries as opposed
*  to general elections. For lawmakers, I think that's what matters. The hard right is praising them
*  for fighting, for showing how to deal with a so-called insurrection. This is what happens now.
*  They're happy with this. They say this is how it should be done.
*  So Emily, in some ways, this is where we are with politics in America right now, right? Like each
*  side, speaking only to its base, not to each other, it's really like a performance intended for an
*  audience that sometimes even outside the state completely. Like the more traditional route for these
*  lawmakers who felt unheard, in some ways would have been to work within the system, focus on changing
*  the power dynamic from the inside by persuading voters in elections, right? But that's not what happened.
*  Right. Because if you're one of these Democrats, how do you find compromise with this particular
*  brand of Republican majority? This is a Republican supermajority that is willing to wield their power
*  in what seems like any way they can to squash concern or pushback from these Democrats who
*  represent these little blue dots in red states. So even if ultimately these Democratic lawmakers
*  end up back in their seats, the fact that Republicans took this step at all, I think raises concerns
*  about the precedent it sets, not only in Tennessee, but across the country, about the steps of
*  supermajority is willing to take to punish duly elected members of the minority.
*  Emily, thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should note today. On Friday night, a federal judge in Texas issued a
*  preliminary ruling invalidating the federal government's 23-year-old approval of the abortion pill,
*  Mifapris Stone. It was an unprecedented order that if it survives court challenges,
*  could make it harder to get abortions in states like New York and California, where the procedure
*  is legal. The drug, part of a two-pill regimen that accounts for about half of all abortions in
*  the country, will continue to be available in the short term. The judge, Matthew Kessmark,
*  suspended his own ruling for a week to give the federal government time to ask an appeals court
*  to intervene. Less than an hour after the ruling came down, a judge in Washington state issued
*  another ruling which contradicted that of the Texas judge. The conflicting orders appeared to
*  create a legal standoff that will likely end up in the Supreme Court.
