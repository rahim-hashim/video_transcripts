# Iranâ€™s Unprecedented Attack on Israel
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5lOfbJS8OU)
*  I'm Isabel Kirschner in Jerusalem.
*  It's coming up to about 5.30 a.m. at the end of a very long and surreal night here.
*  For the first time in Israel's history, the country came under a direct attack from Iran.
*  This night started ominously with cancellations of all educational activities for Sunday morning,
*  then the reports on TV that the airport was closing down after midnight, and then
*  we are following the threat in the airspace.
*  came the announcement that swarms of drones were actually on their way.
*  There were lots of diagrams on TV, how long it takes drones to arrive, how long it takes cruise missiles to arrive,
*  how long it takes ballistic missiles to arrive.
*  So everybody was basically up and waiting.
*  Sure enough, it's about 2 a.m.
*  Air raid sirens were going off in Jerusalem, very quickly followed by a long series of booms in the sky and flashes of light.
*  Wow, wow, wow, look, look, you can't see.
*  Here, now, wait.
*  My apartment building woke up, it came to life.
*  The neighbors were sitting on the stairs in the stairwell.
*  Everybody in this country is used to incoming rocket fire.
*  It was a fairly relaxed atmosphere, but quite surreal and bizarre nonetheless.
*  And now, dawn is just about breaking.
*  I can hear birdsong and we're being told it's not over.
*  There will be some kind of Israeli response.
*  And the question is whether that will be wrapped up within a couple of days or whether we are
*  entering into an unprecedented regional war.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  Overnight on Saturday, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israeli soil,
*  shooting hundreds of missiles and drones at multiple targets around the country.
*  Today, my colleague Eric Schmidt on what happened and what it means
*  for the risk of a broader war in the Middle East.
*  It's Monday, April 15th.
*  So Eric, we witnessed this extraordinary attack overnight on Saturday against Israel by Iran.
*  You know, missiles, drones lighting up the sky in multiple locations around the region.
*  The whole country was really on high alert.
*  I was watching in New York and it really was like the whole world was holding its breath with this
*  attack. Tell me what happened. At around nine o'clock Israel time, we started to get intelligence
*  that the Iranians had launched a first wave of attack drones.
*  Iran has basically three buckets of weapons that they're launching over time against Israel.
*  So the drones come first. They're packed with explosives, relatively slow moving,
*  make a lot of noise with their buzzing that goes on. People can actually see them.
*  The next wave that's coming after this are cruise missiles. These are larger missiles guided that
*  are headed toward Israel at the same time, faster moving. Then finally, the Iranians launch as many
*  as a hundred ballistic missiles. Ballistic missiles are the fastest moving missiles.
*  They carry a big payload. And what makes them so dangerous is that especially if they're launched
*  in large numbers, they can overwhelm defenses on the ground. You've got well over 300 drones
*  and missiles of different kinds that have been engaged. But the thing you have to know about
*  these 300 weapons is that the vast majority of them are actually shot down mostly by Israel,
*  but also by allies like the United States, Britain, and Jordan. And in the end,
*  only a dozen or so, maybe a few more actually impact in Israeli territory.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK So where do these missiles actually hit?
*  JOHN HALLMAN So you have some damage to this air base and then I give desert.
*  You have military targets in the Golan Heights. You have some injuries on the ground, about a dozen
*  or so. Civilians are injured and it's unclear whether it's from the blasts themselves or more
*  likely from some of the shrapnel and debris that's falling from the sky. There was one
*  seven-year-old girl, for instance, who was severely wounded outside of Aradi, Israel,
*  and better when Arab. But no fatalities that we know of so far and no major injuries, which is,
*  given the scale of this attack, is really quite remarkable.
*  LESLIE KENDRICK And Eric, walk me through why this Iranian attack was so clearly repelled.
*  JOHN HALLMAN Well, there's several main reasons. One is that the Israelis have a very sophisticated
*  layer of defenses. The best known of them is called Iron Dome. But it seems here it was another
*  defense technology called Aero System that shoots down ballistic missiles that was particularly
*  effective. And in addition to Israel's already very strong defenses, you have a number of Israel's
*  allies, principally the United States, that it's engaging with their combat planes. They've got F-15
*  fighter jets up in the sky that are shooting down, we were told, more than 70 of these exploding
*  drones. And then you've got a couple of US Navy destroyers off the coast of Israel in the Eastern
*  Mediterranean Sea that take down as many as six of these ballistic missiles. The other thing that's
*  obviously important is that Iran gave everyone a lot of warning this was going to happen.
*  We didn't know exactly which bases they were going to shoot at. We didn't know exactly what part of
*  the country was going to be attacked. But it became pretty clear in the messaging that Iran
*  did beforehand that they weren't going to attack major cities. That wasn't the goal here. That
*  wasn't the objective. It was going to go after military targets in the way they did it was pretty
*  much as US officials expected the Iranians to do. SONIA DARA So Eric, it seems like really at the
*  end of the day, this attack, despite its unprecedented nature, was actually really not
*  nearly as bad as it could have been from the Israeli perspective. But why did Iran attack
*  Israel to begin with? ERIC Yeah, I mean, as you said, this is really from the US and Israeli
*  perspective, given the vast number of drones and missiles that were launched at Israel,
*  this was a win that they were able to get out of this crisis with relatively little damage on the
*  ground and all that. But for the Iranians, you have to understand what prompted this in the first
*  place. SONIA DARA The latest now from the Middle East, Syrian state media reporting that an airstrike
*  hit Iran's consular building in Syria today. ERIC And what this is really all about was retaliation
*  for a strike on April 1st that the Israelis carried out in Damascus, Syria.
*  SONIA DARA Among the dead pulled from the rubble a high-ranking Iranian military leader.
*  ERIC And even though the Israelis haven't come out and formally acknowledged this,
*  it's clear that Israel is behind this. SONIA DARA
*  Mohamed Zahidi, one of the leaders of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, a commander that was
*  involved in the weapon shipments to groups like Hezbollah and Iran-backed Syrian Shia militias,
*  has been targeted in an Israeli airstrike this afternoon.
*  ERIC These weren't just any old Iranian officers. These were a couple of their top generals and
*  other senior officials from a group called the Quds Force. It's a wing of the Iranian security
*  services that carries out covert operations across the region in places like Gaza, in places like
*  Lebanon. These are the actors that organized the very attacks against Israel.
*  SONIA DARA Israel has long targeted Iranian military installations in Syria.
*  Monday's attack marked the first time Iran's embassy compound itself had been hit.
*  ERIC But the other important thing, these guys weren't killed on some dusty road,
*  in a military truck, in some battlefield or anything like this. They were in a diplomatic
*  facility. This is kind of essentially their sovereign soil in a foreign country. And if
*  that's violated, it's a big deal. So for the Iranians, it's not just the loss of these key
*  operatives in this covert organization that carries out some of their most sinister activities,
*  but it's almost as if you're carrying out a strike on Iranian soil itself, this embassy complex.
*  And they feel they need to respond to this and respond in kind, respond in force.
*  Because carrying out an attack on Iranian soil, effectively, was really an audacious thing to do.
*  ERIC Absolutely. And this was so audacious that the Israelis didn't tell their closest ally,
*  the United States, until about five minutes before the strike is going to hit. American
*  officials were not happy. Not only does it create this diplomatic and security challenge, but it
*  also, for Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, it presents a very serious problem about what will
*  the response be and what kind of threats now would this pose to American troops in the Middle East.
*  So the US does something pretty unusual right away. One is they come out and say publicly that the
*  Israelis didn't give them any kind of advance notice of this. And the other thing they do that's also
*  unusual is the United States, kind of both publicly but very much privately, starts to signal the
*  Iranians through back channels that the US government had nothing to do with this attack
*  on April 1st in the Damascus embassy. They had no prior knowledge of it and were not involved in it.
*  And so the message to the Iranians from Washington is don't blame us. We know Israel is our key ally,
*  but we had no idea this was coming. We don't want to get caught in the blowback.
*  LESLIE Interesting. So the Americans are basically saying, look, Israel, we're in the
*  middle of a pretty high-stakes situation here. There's this war in Gaza, proxies are firing
*  rockets into your territory. It's all kind of on a hair's trigger. Taking this shot at these
*  Iranian military officials was not a good idea. How do the Israelis respond? What is their
*  explanation to their American allies for killing this top Iranian commander on April 1st?
*  MICHAEL Well, the Israelis are saying, look, these are the people that are planning attacks
*  on us through their proxies, and we are in a war of survival with them. And they are the
*  root of the problem that we are facing, not just in Gaza with Hamas, but with Hezbollah,
*  with the Houthis in Yemen, with these militias in Iraq and Syria. Iran is behind all of these
*  groups, these partners and proxies that they have, and they're willing to take the risk.
*  Despite the blowback that they almost certainly know will happen once they strike
*  these Iranians in Syria, they're willing to take it because they just don't get opportunities
*  like this very often. And they feel pretty confident that they can take a step like this,
*  as risky it is and audacious as it is, because they've seen it work before.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Eric, why were the Israelis so confident that engaging with Iran in this kind of risky way
*  was something they were willing to gamble on? I mean, it resulted in this historic Iranian attack.
*  So why risk something like that?
*  ERIC So the Israelis had been involved in a shadow war with Iran for years,
*  where each side took shots at some of their senior military people or other operatives.
*  But it's always been kind of below the radar, if you will. The Israelis strike on April 1st,
*  the precipitated this attack from Iran was a clear departure from that shadow war.
*  And I think one reason why Israel had that change in approach was because it was looking
*  to a specific American action against Iran as a kind of a model.
*  In January 2020, the United States under President Trump made an extraordinary move.
*  He went after a guy named Major General Qasem Soleimani.
*  Now, Soleimani at the time was Iran's most powerful security and intelligence commander.
*  And he worked closely with Iraqi and Lebanese allies.
*  He nurtured proxy forces to form a kind of Shiite
*  axis of power throughout the whole region.
*  Many in Iran lauded him as a hero, somebody who was essentially untouchable to the west.
*  And he was almost too big to kill.
*  However, he'd also been long designated as a terrorist by the United States and because
*  many of his forces had been fighting against the United States after the United States invasion of Iraq.
*  So Trump orders a strike to kill General Soleimani.
*  He was on a visit to Iraq and while he's at the Baghdad airport, they take him out.
*  And it's just stunning.
*  I remember the strike because it was, you know, everybody was saying,
*  this is going to be the beginning of the end.
*  I mean, this guy is the most important guy in many ways in Iran and the United States just killed him.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, Trump said he was plotting imminent and sinister attacks against American interests.
*  That was his reasoning after the strike.
*  But everybody was just waiting, holding their breath for what's going to happen next.
*  What will be Iran's response to the death of their top general?
*  And sure enough, five days later, Iran responded.
*  They launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles at Al-Assad Air Base, a major American base in
*  Western Iraq where hundreds of US service members are stationed.
*  The response was important in Iran's view.
*  This is a major attack.
*  Again, using a very sophisticated weapon against an American base in Iraq.
*  More than 100 Americans suffered brain injuries, but no one was killed.
*  Given Soleimani's position and the influence he had over covert operations,
*  the Iranian attack could have been much worse.
*  In fact, the Iranians come out looking kind of restrained in the response.
*  Iran did not want a full-scale war with the United States at this point,
*  despite their public remarks, despite the loss of this revered general.
*  Bush came to shove at that point.
*  They did not want to cross that line.
*  So what is the lesson in the Soleimani example for what we saw this past weekend, Eric?
*  I mean, is it fair to say that perhaps the Israelis were right in their assumptions?
*  That what we saw in how Iran prosecuted this attack on Saturday, the advanced warning,
*  the slow rollout, the targeting of remote bases rather than urban centers, that all of this seems
*  to have been done to send a signal.
*  And that that signal was that Iran is only willing to go so far.
*  Yes, they're essentially maneuvering themselves to give them a way out.
*  That's an off-ramp here.
*  But basically saying, okay, look, we're done for these strikes for now.
*  This has been a defensive measure.
*  That's how they're calling it.
*  That's how they're casting it.
*  And basically, unless you Israelis want to ramp this thing up, we're done.
*  We're done for now.
*  And that seems to be where Iran wants to leave it.
*  And so the ball is in Israel's court right now as to what the response will be next.
*  Okay.
*  So what do we know about what Israel's thinking?
*  What's going to be Israel's response?
*  So that's the question everyone is asking right now.
*  Israel's closest and strongest ally, the United States, is pushing Israel to basically stop here.
*  President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu and told him, hey,
*  you got everything you wanted.
*  You killed the generals.
*  You staved off this massive Iranian attack.
*  This basically could not have worked out any better for you.
*  Take the out the Iranians are giving you and let this be the end of it for now.
*  Look, we came to your aid when you were in need.
*  We put our planes and our ships in harm's way and help knock down these missiles and drones,
*  but we will not help you retaliate against Iran if that's the decision you decide to make.
*  Eric, this strikes me as a pretty tricky moment for President Biden, right?
*  Because he's asking Netanyahu not to escalate.
*  But at the end of the day, you know, Netanyahu has lots of constituencies he's dealing with.
*  He's under lots of pressure.
*  And now that Iran has attacked like this directly,
*  it's going to be harder for Biden to use his leverage against Israel.
*  So I guess the next question then is will Netanyahu actually take the win
*  as the Americans are advising him to do?
*  Well, that's the open question.
*  You've got in one year, the Americans are telling him, stop, take the win.
*  Don't make this any worse.
*  But in the other year, you've got the far right cabinet members saying,
*  you cannot let this stand.
*  You must strike aggressively back.
*  You cannot do this.
*  And so what you've seen, at least the early statements from the Israelis are saying,
*  look, we will continue to defend ourselves and we will respond at a time and place of our choosing.
*  It's sort of international speak for we're going to do something,
*  but we're going to do it later.
*  That's right.
*  And of course, were the hardliners in Netanyahu's cabinet to win out,
*  that of course would potentially spark the regional war that we've long been worrying about
*  and have been talking to you for a long time about, Eric.
*  That's right.
*  And of course, that would have multiple effects.
*  I mean, think about it.
*  Just as there's this huge debate before all this happened over the Israeli
*  operation in Rafa and southern Gaza now.
*  Well, Israel's ability already is so difficult to do that.
*  But can you imagine having to try and prosecute its mission of dismantling
*  the last stronghold of Hamas and Gaza and having to fight some other kind of
*  broader second or third front at the same time?
*  As a whole, it would upset the stability of the entire region if this happens.
*  And any escalation here would open the door to a much wider regional war.
*  And the question is, will Israel bring us into one or will Iran lose patience
*  and bring us into one from that side?
*  Yes.
*  In the United States and Iran, they're saying here, is this the line we're willing to walk up to?
*  And the question is whether Israel is willing to set that line or go further.
*  You seem to have, in this case, the Iranians and the Americans in a weird way are kind of
*  a line in this, like enough, enough already.
*  And the Israelis, everybody's kind of leaning forward and saying, okay, now what?
*  And I think that's the question.
*  What's the point of doing that?
*  Is this going to get worse?
*  And that's what we just don't know yet.
*  Eric, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting at the request of Israel,
*  with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent the conflict in the Middle East from escalating.
*  The Secretary General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, told the council that it was,
*  quote, time to step back from the break.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Friday, in a major turnaround, the House passed a reauthorization of a surveillance law
*  that national security officials say is crucial to gathering intelligence and fighting terrorism,
*  and civil liberties advocates say improperly allows warrantless surveillance of American citizens.
*  The law, known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, had stalled in the
*  House just a few days before, when former President Donald Trump had urged lawmakers to kill it.
*  But Republican Speaker Mike Johnson rescued it by putting forward a version that extends the law
*  by just two years instead of the original five.
*  That was enough to persuade hard-right Republicans, who had been blocking the bill, to vote for it.
*  And in Sydney, Australia, six people were killed and at least 12 others were injured
*  in a stabbing rampage at a crowded shopping mall on Saturday.
*  The attack was the deadliest act of mass violence in the country in years.
*  The authorities said that there were no indications that it was a hate crime or related to terrorism.
