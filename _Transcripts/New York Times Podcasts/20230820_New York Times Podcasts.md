# The Sunday Read: ‘The Ongoing Mystery of Covid’s Origin’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic8_N_RhzmI)
*  Hi, this is David Quammen.
*  I'm an author and journalist, and I've been writing articles and books about emerging
*  diseases and novel viruses for the past two decades.
*  This week's Sunday Read is a story of mine about the origins of the COVID virus.
*  We still don't know, with total certainty, how the coronavirus pandemic started.
*  Where did that virus come from?
*  Earlier this year, I saw that the idea of a lab leak origin was becoming more popular,
*  even though there was no increase in evidence to support that hypothesis.
*  And that imbalance concerned me.
*  It puzzled me.
*  So in this piece I wrote for the New York Times Magazine, I explore two questions that
*  still controversial more than three and a half years into this pandemic.
*  First, what is the origin of the virus known as SARS-CoV-2?
*  Where did it come from?
*  And second, why is the preponderance of evidence on one side of the debate and the preponderance
*  of public opinion on another?
*  So the origins debate centers on three main hypotheses.
*  The first is the natural origin hypothesis, the idea that the virus spilled over from
*  a wild animal, probably an animal that had been brought to the infamous wet market, the
*  Wanan market in Wuhan, China, and was being sold for food.
*  The second hypothesis argues that the COVID virus is a bio weapon that was intentionally
*  engineered and released to infect people.
*  And then there is a third theory, the lab leak hypothesis.
*  It suggests that a lab worker in Wuhan was doing research on coronaviruses, possibly
*  altering a virus's genome to see if certain alterations would make it more dangerous to
*  humans.
*  And then this lab worker, so the theory goes, got infected with the virus and carried it
*  out into the world.
*  And that became the pandemic.
*  Now, I want to emphasize that we still don't know for sure which of these hypotheses is
*  true.
*  We don't have the final gold standard of proof.
*  But while the evidence is heavily on the side of a natural origin, there's quite a bit of
*  inclination among the public and not just in the US to believe that COVID came from
*  a lab leak.
*  The story you're about to hear gets into why that is and why it matters.
*  So here's my article, The Ongoing Mystery of COVID's Origin, read for you by Eduardo
*  Ballerini.
*  Where did it come from?
*  More than three years into the pandemic and untold millions of people dead, that question
*  about the COVID-19 coronavirus remains controversial and fraught, with facts sparkling amid a
*  tangle of analyses and hypotheticals like Christmas lights strung on a dark, thorny
*  tree.
*  One school of thought holds that the virus, known to science as SARS-CoV-2, spilled into
*  humans from a non-human animal, probably in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a messy
*  emporium in Wuhan, China, brimming with fish, meats and wildlife on sale as food.
*  Another school argues that the virus was laboratory engineered to infect humans and
*  cause them harm, a bio-weapon, and was possibly devised in a shadow project sponsored by the
*  People's Liberation Army of China.
*  A third school, more moderate than the second but also implicating laboratory work, suggests
*  that the virus got into its first human victim by way of an accident at the Wuhan Institute
*  of Virology, WIV, a research complex on the eastern side of the city, maybe after well-meaning
*  but reckless genetic manipulation that made it more dangerous to people.
*  If you feel confused by these possibilities, undecided, suspicious of overconfident assertions,
*  or just tired of the whole subject of the pandemic and whatever little bug has caused
*  it, be assured that you aren't the only one.
*  Some contrarians say that it doesn't matter, the source of the virus.
*  What matters, they say, is how we cope with the catastrophe it has brought, the illness
*  and death it continues to cause.
*  Those contrarians are wrong.
*  It does matter.
*  Research priorities, pandemic preparedness around the world, health policies and public
*  opinion towards science itself will be lastingly affected by the answer to the origin question,
*  if we ever get a definitive answer.
*  But much of the evidence that might provide that answer has either been lost or is still
*  unavailable.
*  Lost because of failures to gather relevant material promptly, unavailable because of intransigence
*  and concealment, particularly on the part of Chinese officialdom at several levels.
*  Take the natural spillover hypothesis, for instance, and assume that the virus passed
*  to humans from a wild animal.
*  Be a raccoon dog, a fox-like canine, or a Malayan porcupine, somewhere in the Huanan
*  market.
*  To test that hypothesis, you would want samples of blood, feces or mucus taken from the raccoon
*  dogs, porcupines and other wildlife that languished, caged and doomed in the market.
*  You would screen those samples for signs of the virus.
*  If you found the virus itself, or at least sizable bits of its genome, you would then
*  make a comparative analysis of genomes, including some from the earliest human cases to deduce
*  whether people got the virus from the wildlife or vice versa.
*  But you can't do that, because whatever raccoon dogs or porcupines or other wild animals were
*  on sale in the market during December 2019 had vanished by January 1, 2020.
*  On that date, the market was closed by order of Chinese authorities, with no reported effort
*  to sample the most suspect forms of wildlife.
*  Or take the lab-engineered bioweapon hypothesis as recently offered in an article in the Sunday
*  Times of London.
*  The Two Times reporter cited unidentified U.S. investigators who scrutinized top-secret
*  intercepted communications and concluded that the Chinese military was supporting a covert
*  project to develop a weaponized coronavirus.
*  The article also posited a related vaccine effort to protect China's populace once the
*  killer virus was unleashed on the world.
*  It's a riveting narrative.
*  The virus engineering occurred, according to this account, at the Wuhan Institute of
*  Virology.
*  The reporters didn't name their intelligence sources or supply evidence to make their allegations
*  concrete, but if they did, it would be explosive news.
*  Or take the lab leak scenario, some versions of which point accusingly at a non-profit
*  organization in New York, EcoHealth Alliance, and its collaborative relationship with Dr.
*  Shengli Xi, a senior researcher at the WIV.
*  She and her team study coronaviruses, especially those carried by bats extracting fragments
*  of viral RNA, the molecule in which coronavirus genomes are written, and occasionally live
*  virus, from samples of guano and other bodily material and assembling whole genome sequences
*  like jigsaw puzzles from the fragments.
*  They perform experiments, sometimes combining an element of one virus with the backbone
*  of another, to learn how that element might function in the wild.
*  And they publish scientific papers, warning which bat viruses could pose a threat to humans.
*  What if a researcher or technician under Xi's leadership, handling a virus very much like
*  SARS-CoV-2, became infected by accident and then spread the infection to others?
*  That question became, from the early months of the pandemic, a suspicion, and then a hypothesis,
*  and then an accusation.
*  Even now, the trade in claims and counterclaims remains brisk.
*  Last month, in a substack newsletter called Public, three authors asserted, citing unnamed
*  U.S. government officials, that one of the first people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was
*  a scientist named Ben Hu from Xi's lab.
*  That assertion was significant, and important if true, but no proof or identified sourcing
*  so far supports it.
*  Ten days later, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released, as required
*  by a law passed three months earlier, a declassified report outlining whatever was known to the
*  U.S. intelligence community about potential links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology
*  and the origins of the pandemic.
*  The report concluded, among other things, that WIV personnel had collaborated at times
*  on coronavirus work with scientists associated with the People's Liberation Army.
*  But that, so far as available evidence showed, such work involved no known viruses that could
*  plausibly be a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2.
*  And then on July 11th, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, led by Representative
*  and Ohio Republican, convened a hearing at which he and colleagues interrogated two scientists,
*  Christian Anderson and Robert Gary, about their authorship of an influential 2020 paper
*  that appeared in the journal Nature Medicine.
*  That paper was titled, The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2.
*  The tenor of the hearing was foretold by its own announced title, Investigating the Proximal
*  Origin of a Cover-Up.
*  And the proceedings that day consisted of accusation and defense, without shedding any
*  new light, let alone yielding certitude about the origin of the virus.
*  Certitude is an elusive goal and a high presumption, even for science, even for a director of national
*  intelligence, even for the chairman of a select congressional subcommittee.
*  Philosophers have recognized that, and so have novelists and poets.
*  I was of three minds, wrote Wallace Stevens, like a tree in which there are three blackbirds.
*  In the poem, Stevens found 13 different ways of looking at a blackbird.
*  There are at least that many ways of viewing the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
*  And to do justice to the question, you'll need, like him, to hold several possibilities
*  in your mind at a time.
*  How you regard a blackbird, or an origin hypothesis, may be influenced by where you're coming from.
*  That's an old truth, but I was reminded of it during a conversation with Jesse Bloom,
*  an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, and one of the best
*  qualified among those who argue that the lab leak hypothesis deserves robust investigation.
*  Bloom studies the evolution of viruses for two reasons.
*  It happens fast and therefore illuminates evolution in general, and it has large implications
*  for public health.
*  When I spoke with him back in February 2021, a year into the pandemic, and asked about
*  the origin question, Bloom said, I think what you have is a lot of people strongly defaulting
*  to their prior beliefs.
*  Scientists who study zoonotic diseases, those that spill over from non-human animals into
*  people, might be inclined to assume a natural origin.
*  Scientists who have long argued against the risks of gain-of-function research, experimental
*  The work exploring the evolutionary capacities of potentially dangerous pathogens might readily
*  assume a lab leak.
*  National security experts, with strong views of the oppressive, secretive Chinese government,
*  might lean towards scenarios involving Chinese malfeasance and cover-up.
*  More recently, Bloom told me that his own prior inclination would be toward a natural
*  spillover.
*  But you certainly wouldn't think it's like 99.99% the most likely explanation, he said,
*  and in the same time, there could be other possibilities.
*  That gave me pause to consider my own priors.
*  For the past 40 years, I've written non-fiction about the natural world and the sciences that
*  study it, especially ecology and evolutionary biology.
*  During the first half of that, my attention went mainly to large, visible creatures like
*  bears, crocodiles, and bumblebees, and to wild places like the Amazon jungle and the
*  Sonoran desert.
*  I came to the subject of emerging viruses in 1999, during a National Geographic assignment,
*  when I walked for ten days through Ebola virus habitat in a Central African forest.
*  Later I spent five years writing a book about zoonotic diseases and the agents that caused
*  them, including the SARS virus, the earlier killer coronavirus now often called SARS-CoV-1,
*  which emerged in 2002 and spread in human travelers from Hong Kong to Singapore, Toronto,
*  and elsewhere, alarming experts deeply.
*  Scientists traced SARS-CoV-1 to palm civets, a type of cat-like wild carnivore sold as
*  food in some South China markets and restaurants, but the civets proved to be intermediate hosts,
*  and its natural host was later identified as horseshoe bats.
*  The story of SARS is only one chapter in the saga of dangerous new viruses emerging from
*  animals.
*  The grim tale of how HIV got into humans and caused the AIDS pandemic is another, a tale
*  known partly by inference and partly by molecular evidence and traceable back to a single blood-mingling
*  event between a person and a chimpanzee, probably hunter and hunted, in the southeastern corner
*  of Cameroon around the start of the 20th century.
*  Human contact with non-human animals accounts for our influences as well, which usually
*  emerge from wild aquatic birds.
*  Hendra virus in Australia comes to humans from bats, generally through an intermediate
*  host, horses.
*  Machupo virus in Bolivia abides in rodents when not infecting people.
*  Hantone virus discovered in Korea and its relative Sin Nombre virus in the American
*  Southwest also spill over from rodents.
*  Nipah virus in Bangladesh and some surrounding countries comes from bats.
*  It's excreted in bat feces, saliva and urine, and when certain fruit bats visit date palm
*  trees that are being tapped for their sugary sap, a custom in Bangladesh, the virus contaminates
*  the sap, which is sold fresh on the street to local customers, some of whom die.
*  These cases and many others like them are among my own priors, and no doubt they do
*  incline me toward the idea of natural spillover.
*  It happens often, sometimes with dire consequences.
*  Such accidents have occurred too in the history of dangerous new viruses, and long-time concerns
*  over such accidents constitute the priors of some who favor the lab leak hypothesis
*  for COVID.
*  Such accidents might number in the hundreds or the thousands, depending on where you put
*  the threshold of significance and how you define accident.
*  There was an event that, probably, reintroduced a 1950 strain of influenza in 1977, causing
*  that year's flu pandemic, which killed many thousands of people, and a 2004 needlestick
*  injury of a careful scientist, Kelly Warfield, while she was doing Ebola research, but she
*  proved uninfected by Ebola.
*  Also in 2004, just a year after the global SARS scare, two workers at a virology lab
*  in Beijing were independently infected with that virus, which spread to nine people in
*  total, one of whom died.
*  This followed two other single-case lab accident infections with SARS virus the previous year.
*  One in Singapore, one in Taiwan.
*  When the first known cases of an atypical pneumonia began turning up at Wuhan hospitals
*  in late 2019, and then exploded into a coronavirus outbreak in early 2020, the location itself
*  seemed to fit, in different ways, the priors that might incline one toward either a natural
*  origin explanation or a lab leak explanation.
*  The potential lab leak connection was easiest to note.
*  The city contained a research facility, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, with a well-known
*  laboratory devoted to coronavirus research.
*  On the other hand, Wuhan was also a major nexus for the significant national trade in
*  wild animals for food, fur, and traditional medicines, estimated at more than $70 billion
*  annually, where such creatures and the viruses they carry were sold at many crowded markets,
*  one of which, Quanan, lay at or near the center of the spatial pattern of earliest known cases.
*  So starting from simply those circumstances, was a lab accident more likely than a natural spillover?
*  And under either of those scenarios, how much did Chinese government pressure and obscurantism
*  constrain the availability of evidence for assessing one or the other?
*  Because there exists no definitive account, yet, of the particular events that delivered
*  SARS-CoV-2 into the human population, even experts are forced to frame their views as
*  probabilities based on data and circumstance, influenced variously by prior beliefs as to
*  how the world works.
*  In assessing the probabilities for yourself, you might want to step back from the noise,
*  anger, vitriol, and politicization that have clouded the controversy and focus on the evidence
*  we do have.
*  To that end, it may help to note some events in the order they occurred.
*  On January 11, 2020, in Shanghai, just 11 days after first reports of the outbreak in
*  Wuhan circulated globally, a team of scientists led by Yongchen Chong of Fudan University
*  released a draft genome sequence of the novel virus through a website called Virological.org.
*  The genome was provided by Edward C. Holmes, a British-Australian evolutionary biologist
*  based in Sydney and a colleague of Chong's on the Genome Assembly Project.
*  Holmes is famous among virologists for his work on the evolution of RNA viruses, including
*  coronaviruses, his pristinely bald head, and his mordant candor.
*  Everyone in the field knows him as Eddie.
*  The posting went up at 1.05 a.m. Scotland time, at which point the curator of the site
*  there in Edinburgh, a professor of molecular evolution named Andrew Rombo, was alert and
*  ready to speed things along.
*  He and Holmes composed a brief introductory note to the genome.
*  Please feel free to download, share, use, and analyze this data, it said.
*  They knew that data is plural, but they were in a hurry.
*  Immediately, Holmes and a small group of colleagues set to analyzing the genome for
*  clues about the virus's evolutionary history.
*  They drew on a background of known coronaviruses and their own understanding of how such
*  viruses take shape in the wild, as reflected in Holmes' 2009 book, The Evolution and
*  Emergence of RNA Viruses.
*  They knew that coronavirus evolution can occur rapidly, driven by frequent mutation,
*  single-letter changes in a roughly 30,000-letter genome, by recombination, one virus
*  swapping genome sections with another virus when both simultaneously replicate in a
*  single cell, and by Darwinian natural selections acting on those random changes.
*  Holmes traded thoughts with Rombo in Edinburgh, a friend of three decades, and with
*  two other colleagues, Christian Anderson at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California,
*  and Robert Gary at the Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans.
*  Ian Lipkin of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health joined the huddle
*  later.
*  These five would form a sort of long-distance study group, aimed toward publishing a
*  paper on SARS-CoV-2's genome and its likely origin.
*  Holmes, Anderson, and their colleagues recognized the virus's similarity to bat viruses,
*  but with more study, saw a pair of notable features that gave them pause.
*  Those features, two short blips of genome, constituted a very small percentage of the
*  whole, but with potentially high significance for the virus's ability to grab and infect
*  human cells.
*  They were technical-sounding elements, familiar to virologists, that are now part of
*  the COVID-origin vernacular, a furan cleavage site, FCS, as well as an unexpected
*  receptor-binding domain, RBD.
*  All viruses have RBDs, which help them attach to cells, and FCS is a feature that helps
*  certain viruses get inside.
*  The original SARS virus, which terrified scientists worldwide but caused only about
*  800 deaths, didn't resemble the new coronavirus in either respect.
*  How had SARS-CoV-2 come to take this form?
*  Anderson and Holmes were genuinely concerned at first that it might have been engineered.
*  Were those two features deliberate add-ons?
*  Inserted into some coronavirus backbone by genetic manipulation?
*  Intentionally making the virus more transmissible and pathogenic among humans?
*  It had to be considered.
*  Holmes called Jeremy Farrar a disease expert who was then director of the Welcome Trust,
*  a foundation in London that supports health research.
*  Farrar saw the point and quickly arranged a conference call among an international
*  group of scientists to discuss the genome's puzzling aspects and the possible scenarios
*  of its origin.
*  The group included Robert-Gerriot Tulane and a dozen other people, most of them distinguished
*  European or British scientists with relevant expertise, like Rambo in Edinburgh, Marian
*  Koopmans in the Netherlands, and Christian Drosten in Germany.
*  Also on the call were Anthony Fauci, then head of the National Institute of Allergy
*  and Infectious Diseases, and Francis Collins, then director of the National Institutes of Health
*  and therefore Fauci's boss.
*  This is the famous February 1st call, on which, if you believe some critical voices,
*  Fauci and Collins persuaded the others to suppress any notion that the virus might
*  have been engineered.
*  The narrative going around was that Fauci told us, change our mind, yada yada yada yada.
*  We were paid off, Holmes said to me.
*  It's complete ****.
*  Anderson concurs.
*  There is no universe in which this would even be possible, he told me.
*  Recently, based on selections of their private email and Slack traffic made public,
*  Anderson and his colleagues have been accused of concealment and dissembling.
*  Their messages, critics contend, prove that even as they were deeply concerned
*  in private about the engineered virus or lab release possibilities,
*  they were striving to keep both out of public discussion.
*  But as the researchers describe it, these apparent contradictions were simply a reflection
*  of their fast-evolving views.
*  After initial concern that the receptor binding domain in SARS-CoV-2 might be a sign
*  of engineering, for instance, they learned soon after the February 1st conference call
*  of a very similar RBD in a coronavirus that infected pangolins.
*  It was detected from a public database by a bioinformatician in Houston,
*  Matt Wong, and posted on the virological website, where it eventually came to
*  the group's attention.
*  It showed that such an RBD had evolved in the wild and might well have gotten into
*  SARS-CoV-2 by recombination, the natural gene swapping process.
*  Anderson and the others also recognized that furan cleavage sites occur naturally
*  in other coronaviruses, like the MERS virus, though not, as so far detected,
*  in any other member of the subgenus to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs.
*  Such new data led to a new conclusion, and what Anderson called on Twitter,
*  a clear example of the scientific process.
*  16 days after the conference call, they posted a preprint, a draft, not yet peer
*  reviewed, of their paper, and four weeks later it appeared in the journal Nature Medicine.
*  This was the one titled, The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
*  Anderson and his co-authors stated their conclusion at the top.
*  Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct
*  or a purposefully manipulated virus.
*  That still left the possibility of a natural virus, evolved in an animal host and passed
*  into humans by zoonotic transfer. Or perhaps, a natural virus accidentally leaked?
*  Near the paper's end, they stated something more nuanced. That while intentional engineering of
*  the virus could be ruled out, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories
*  of its origin described here. That said, they added, we do not believe that any type of
*  laboratory-based scenario is plausible.
*  One other coronavirus quickly came to light as the closest known match to SARS-CoV-2.
*  This wasn't actually a virus in the flesh, in physical presence.
*  It was a genome sequence, assembled from RNA fragments extracted from a fecal swab sample
*  of a bat, captured in a mine several years earlier in 2013. The mine was in Yunnan province,
*  1200 miles southwest of Wuhan. The genome was 96.2% identical to the SARS-CoV-2 genome
*  as sampled from people during the early days of the pandemic. That degree of similarity,
*  or a 3.8% difference, suggests a common virus ancestor some years ago,
*  and independent evolution in the years since. So this represented a cousin to SARS-CoV-2,
*  not its progenitor. The work of sampling the bat and assembling the sequence, first just a portion,
*  then with better technology, nearly the whole thing, had been led by Shengli Shi
*  at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. She and her team labeled the sequence RATG13,
*  coding the facts that it came from an individual of Rhinolophus affinis,
*  R.A., the intermediate horseshoe bat, captured in that mine in Tongguan, T.G., a town in the
*  Mojiang district of Yunnan, in 2013. RATG13 has attained renown, not just because it constituted
*  strong evidence of SARS-CoV-2's ancestry in bat viruses, but also because the Mojiang mine
*  figures in some of the more lurid scenarios for a lab leak origin.
*  Part of what makes the very name Mojiang seem lurid is that in 2012, three workers at the mine
*  died of unidentified respiratory infections after days of underground labor there. What got into
*  their lungs and killed them? Was it a fungus? Was it a virus? Some lab leak proponents suggest that
*  those deaths, described in two obscure medical theses written in Mandarin, represent the earliest
*  known fatalities from a virus, possibly RATG13, that either already was or in Xi's lab became
*  SARS-CoV-2 or its immediate progenitor, that is, something far more similar than a cousin.
*  The inference is that Xi's team, a year after the mine workers died,
*  may have taken the virus back to Wuhan. But the Mojiang deaths were also reported in 2014
*  in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases by scientists who found an entirely different
*  virus, also potentially dangerous because it had similarities to Nipah and Hendra viruses,
*  and was carried in the Mojiang mine by rats, not bats. One takeaway? Sample the rats and bats and
*  other fauna in a mine, and you might well find a variety of viruses you wouldn't want in your lungs.
*  Another problem with the RATG13 scenario. Its genome differs from that of SARS-CoV-2
*  at more than 1,100 scattered positions throughout its genome. To engineer SARS-CoV-2 into existence
*  by starting with RATG13 would have been unreasonable and impractical, according to
*  Holmes and other experts in coronavirus genomics. Furthermore, it's important to remember that
*  RATG13 was a genome sequence, not a live virus. It was information, not a biological entity,
*  coaxing a virus that lies dormant in bat guano to grow in a cell culture is difficult,
*  and usually the effort fails. Shang Li-Jie told John Cohen,
*  a senior correspondent for the journal Science, in her answer to a set of emailed questions,
*  that she never grew RATG13 in her lab. She told me the same thing during a two-hour
*  conversation by Zoom. No, no, we couldn't culture any of the sample from this cave at Mojiang.
*  She was in Shanghai for a conference on the night of December 30, 2019, as she explained it to me,
*  when word reached her about a mysterious respiratory illness spreading dangerously
*  among people back in Wuhan. Preliminary lab results suggested a coronavirus,
*  not SARS virus, but something similar, might be the cause. She was asked to help identify the
*  thing. She put her lab team to work on that immediately and took a train back to Wuhan the
*  next day. Within hours, her lab had received a partial sequence from another lab. Her first
*  instinct was to compare it with sequences of viruses they had worked on themselves.
*  And we found it's different, she told me. So the afternoon of December 31,
*  I already know it's nothing related to what we have done in our laboratory.
*  Some critics, she was well aware, had suggested that her urgency in checking her own records
*  was an implicit admission of error or guilt. It's normal, was her response.
*  John Cohen mentioned the possibility of a lab leak in a report published in Science on January 31,
*  2020, noting that not all the earliest confirmed cases had some direct link to the Huanan market.
*  Fourteen of the first forty-one, according to one study, did not. Might those people have picked up
*  their infections somewhere else, and maybe not from an animal at all? After describing a couple
*  of vivid but unsupported allegations, including the idea that SARS-CoV-2 resembled a snake virus,
*  and snakes were sold at Wuhan wet markets, Cohen added, the Wuhan Institute of Virology,
*  which is the premier lab in China that studies bat and human coronaviruses, has also come under fire.
*  Concerns had been voiced, he wrote, about the security of the WIV's biosafety procedures and
*  facilities. Evidence regarding the origin of the virus, apart from what could be read from the
*  genome itself, remained scarce during those early months. In place of evidence, there was the weight
*  of scientific authority on one side and the volume of outcry on the other. On February 19, 2020,
*  an open letter appeared online in The Lancet, a British journal signed by twenty-seven scientists,
*  some of them eminent senior figures in virology and public health, others researchers in the
*  full heat of distinguished careers. It was a statement of solidarity with Chinese scientists
*  and health professionals, who were then on the front line in efforts to understand and control
*  the virus. The letter was organized by Peter Dazak, a British-American disease ecologist,
*  president of EcoHealth Alliance, and a collaborator with Zhang Lishi. Besides voicing support for
*  Chinese colleagues, it said,
*  That expression of confidence, so soon, would prove to be counterproductive, and the phrase
*  conspiracy theories landed like bacon grease thrown into a campfire, causing skeptics to
*  flare and sizzle. The lab leak idea, meanwhile, took hold in some political circles, partly
*  because it dovetailed with attitudes toward the Chinese government, its repressive policies,
*  and its penchant for secrecy. In late January 2020, even before Cohen's January 31 article,
*  The Washington Times ran an article suggesting links between the WIV
*  and a covert bio-weapons program of the Chinese military. The article, later walked back with
*  an editor's note, was based largely on assertions by a former Israeli military intelligence officer.
*  Several weeks afterward, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas voiced a similar suspicion about
*  the Wuhan lab on Fox News. We don't have evidence that this disease originated there,
*  Cotton said, but because of China's duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning,
*  we need to at least ask the question. Soon enough, Donald Trump's mind began to change.
*  The president spoke supportively about China throughout the early weeks of the pandemic,
*  and on February 7th said of President Xi Jinping, I think he's handled it really well.
*  Then the winds shifted, and four months later, Trump was inciting his rally crowds by calling
*  COVID-19 the Kung Flu. The attractions of the lab leak idea weren't entirely partisan.
*  Jamie Metzel is an author and political commentator who worked in the Clinton
*  administration, and at one point, as a Senate committee staff member working closely with
*  Senator Joe Biden. Metzel has a blindingly luminescent and liberal-tinged resume that
*  includes a PhD from Oxford, a JD from Harvard Law School, a senior fellowship at the Atlantic
*  Council, and 13 Iron Man triathlons. A former member of the WHO Expert Advisory Committee on
*  Human Genome Editing, Metzel called early on for an investigation into the origins of the pandemic,
*  including, in his words, the distinct possibility this crisis may stem from a research-related
*  incident in Wuhan. Having spoken up about this in the early months of 2020, Metzel encountered
*  resistance that seems to have startled and aggrieved him. When I was seeing this different
*  story, he told me, and I started speaking publicly about it, friends of mine would say two things.
*  The first was, you're a progressive liberal Democrat, but you're delivering a message that's
*  helpful to Trump. Implication, Metzel should get back on the right side of scrimmage.
*  The second sort of comment he says was, who the F are you? You have all these senior scientists
*  and Nobel laureates and others who are saying it comes from nature? Who the F are you to say that
*  based on your analysis and your deductive reasoning, you have additional questions?
*  The proselytizing by Metzel and others who saw a different story from natural spillover,
*  plus the swing of Trump's message, plus the prevailing cultural disposition to distrust
*  experts, plus no doubt other factors, had an effect on public opinion and media attention,
*  if not on scientific consensus. According to the Pew Research Center, polling Americans in March
*  2020, 43% believed that the virus emerged naturally against less than 30% who thought it came from a
*  lab, developed either by accident or intentionally. By September 2020, another polling organization
*  found the natural versus lab options embraced almost equally. By June 2021, a Politico-Harvard
*  poll put the lab origin idea ahead by a two-to-one margin, 52% of Americans versus 28%.
*  Metzel himself has maintained the somewhat agnostic position that accidental release
*  is a possibility, but not the only possibility. In his eventual March 2023 testimony to Congress,
*  he urged, fully examining all relevant origins hypotheses, obviously including a lab origin,
*  but also a market origin, which some experts I respect believe to be more probable. Among
*  those experts, he cited Michael Warrabee, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Arizona.
*  Warrabee is a Canadian-born Oxford-educated scientist who speaks mildly and sometimes
*  entertains provocative theories. One such theory was OPV, the Oral Polio Vaccine Hypothesis for the
*  Origin of the HIV AIDS Pandemic. I first interviewed Warrabee a dozen years ago to hear about that.
*  The OPV hypothesis asserted that the virus, HIV-1 Group M, was put into humans inadvertently
*  during reckless trials of an oral polio vaccine on unsuspecting African volunteers, including
*  hundreds of thousands of children. The vaccine had been developed in chimpanzee cell cultures,
*  so the hypothesis claimed, and contaminated with a chimpanzee virus that became HIV-1M.
*  In early 2000, Warrabee left his doctoral studies in Oxford, flew to a war zone in the
*  Democratic Republic of the Congo, and spent weeks collecting chimpanzee dung in the forest to test
*  that hypothesis. His senior partner on this wildcat expedition was William Hamilton,
*  a famous Oxford biologist who considered the OPV hypothesis plausible. Warrabee and Hamilton
*  collected their chimpanzee samples with help from local forest guides and then scrambled out
*  of Kisangani, Warrabee with his arm in a sling from a badly infected forest wound, Hamilton
*  desperately ill with malaria. They reached England, and Hamilton died soon afterward from
*  complications. The samples got lost in baggage handling, then found, then tested negative for
*  the chimpanzee virus except for one sample that proved inconclusive. Such are the labors and
*  frustrations of science. Warrabee, along with other scientists drawing on other evidence,
*  eventually showed that the oral vaccine hypothesis was false. Open-mindedness toward a provocative
*  hypothesis and a commitment to confirm it or refute it as the evidence may dictate are among
*  his priors. Massar's CoV-2, twenty years later, Warrabee likewise felt inclined to give the
*  provocative, heterodox hypothesis all due consideration. Concerned by what he saw as
*  premature dismissal of the lab leak possibility, he signed a public letter in spring 2021 with seventeen
*  other scientists arguing that, greater clarity about the origins of this pandemic is necessary
*  and feasible to achieve. We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers
*  seriously until we have sufficient data. One of the letters' other co-signers, in fact the first
*  as listed, was Jesse Bloom. Warrabee had helped initiate the letter with emails to Bloom on March
*  21st of that year, including the suggestion, I have been thinking about something like a
*  perspective in science or an op-ed in the New York Times. The letter was initially drafted by Bloom
*  and two others, Alina Chan, a molecular biologist who was an author of a preprint in 2020,
*  arguing that Sars-CoV-2 was already well adapted to infecting humans at the start,
*  raising questions about its provenance, and David Relman of Stanford, a distinguished
*  microbiologist with a long-term concern about biosecurity issues and some gain-of-function
*  research. Others of the group contributed input, and the letter ran in science on May 14th, 2021,
*  under the imperative title, Investigate the Origins of COVID-19. But from that point,
*  with passing months and more research, Warrabee would diverge from the most vocal of his co-signers
*  regarding what constitutes sufficient data. Strong tides of opinion were moving by spring
*  2021. An international team of scientists recruited by the World Health Organization
*  to its joint WHO-China study of the origins of Sars-CoV-2 had returned from a month in Wuhan
*  and issued its Phase 1 report, finding a laboratory leak extremely unlikely. That
*  finding took criticism from Warrabee, Bloom, and their co-authors of the letter to science,
*  published weeks afterward. Even the Director General of the WHO himself, Dr. Tedros Adnan
*  Gabrielsos, hoped for further investigation. At a news conference marking the report's publication,
*  Tedros said, As far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table, noting the need
*  for continued research. Notwithstanding Tedros' hopes, and mainly because of Chinese resistance,
*  there has been no official Phase 2 follow-up study per se. Instead, the WHO created a scientific
*  advisory group for the origins of novel pathogens, SAGO, a body of disease scientists
*  who will continue to study the origins of Sars-CoV-2 as well as other dangerous new bugs.
*  Maria Van Kurko, the technical lead for COVID at the WHO, has been vocal about the barriers to
*  progress. There's very little information that can be accessed with regard to lab leak, with regard
*  to breach of biosafety or biosecurity. And that's the problem, she told me recently, saying that she
*  had discussed the issue directly with Chinese officials. That's what's frustrating, she added.
*  With that lack of information, you're left with these gaping holes.
*  Popular articles espousing the lab leak idea also began to blossom forth around this time,
*  in magazines and newspapers and on web platforms. In January 2021, New York Magazine carried a
*  COVID-origin article by Nicholson Baker, who had lately published a book on American bio-weapons
*  research in the early 1950s and his frustrations with the Freedom of Information Act. Baker now
*  raised the what-if question about coronavirus research. In May 2021, Nicholas Wade, who once
*  worked for the New York Times, published a long article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
*  describing the collaborations between Chang Lijie's lab and EcoHealth Alliance for research on bad
*  coronaviruses as potential threats to human health, research that, Wade suggested, could have led to
*  the escape of a virus intentionally made more dangerous to humans. Soon afterward, another
*  science writer with former connections to the Times, Donald G. McNeill Jr., found himself moved
*  by Wade's article to do further probing and questioning and posted a more judicious essay
*  concluding, All we have so far is speculation, and all the explanations are unsatisfactory.
*  In early June, Vanity Fair followed with a feature by the journalist Catherine Ebon,
*  suggesting that research at the WIV, or alternatively, field collection of bat samples
*  and the accidental infection of a field worker, might have put the virus, engineered or not,
*  into people. Then came John Stewart. On June 14, 2021, the comedian appeared on Stephen Colbert's
*  show and announced, with sublime confidence and transcendent shallowness, his grounds for certainty
*  that the virus first detected in Wuhan had come from a Wuhan lab.
*  If you look at the name, he shouted, look at the name.
*  Stewart got the name of the institution wrong. In fact, he called WIV, the Wuhan Novel
*  Respiratory Coronavirus Lab, though he got the name of the city right.
*  How much that mattered to Colbert's millions of viewers is unknown.
*  Throughout 2020 and 2021, scientists with deep expertise in relevant fields, especially molecular
*  evolutionary virology, veterinary virology, and molecular phylogenetics, the drawing of family
*  trees by comparison of genomes, were busy too. Their efforts added data and analyses to the
*  natural origin side of the balance. One study by two Chinese researchers and three Westerners
*  showed that the wet markets in Wuhan, not just the notorious Huanan, but also three others,
*  contained numerous shops selling wild animals for food from May 2017 to November 2019.
*  The offerings included raccoon dogs, masked palm civets, and Malayan porcupines. Many of the animals
*  showed what seemed to be wounds from gunshots or traps, suggesting harvest from the wild,
*  as distinct from farm-raised wildlife, but lacked the requisite documentation to make their sale
*  legal under China's wildlife protection law. That's important because it gave local authorities
*  incentive as the pandemic spread to close the market, as they did on January 1st, 2020,
*  and conceal whatever illegalities had been ignored by enforcement officers there.
*  For all the assumptions made about China's motivation to cover up a lab leak,
*  it's worth remembering that they would have had similar motivations, including that $70 billion
*  in the US dollar, and the US dollar in the US dollar, to cover up a devastatingly consequential market leak.
*  Another study, published by Science in July 2022, with Michael Waraby as first author,
*  joined by Eddie Holmes and Marion Kopmans and many others, considered the spatial pattern of
*  more than 150 of the earliest COVID-19 cases from December 2019. Waraby and colleagues found that
*  not only were Huanan market customers and workers, and people in contact with those customers or
*  workers, among those cases living close to the market, but so were patients with no known
*  epidemiological link to the market. Therefore, that market was the early epicenter of the pandemic,
*  as the paper's title declared. A distinct but related study that appeared around the same time
*  with Waraby and other co-authors, but in this case with Jonathan P. Carr as first author,
*  looked at the shape of the SARS-CoV-2 family tree. It was unexpected, as drawn from comparison of
*  genome sequenced from human samples taken at the beginning of the pandemic, it consisted of two
*  thick limbs branching from a trunk, then each limb exploding into many tiny stems, without
*  intermediate branches. The two major limbs were lineages, labeled Lineage A and Lineage B, from
*  which all the virus's later diversity arose. Lineage B was the more prolific and successful,
*  accounting for most of the world's COVID-19 cases, including all early cases directly linked to the
*  market. Lineage A had been found in the market, too, by the Chinese team that swabbed after the
*  place was summarily closed. That smudge of A turned up on a pair of discarded gloves.
*  Lineage A was also detected in two COVID patients living near the market.
*  P. Carr and his colleagues did a high-tech analysis of the tree pattern, those two big limbs,
*  then that explosion of twiggy stems from each, and concluded that the virus probably entered
*  humans multiple times. The outbreak of human infections, they judged, most likely had at least
*  two separate beginnings. Why did this finding matter? Two spillovers into people from a market
*  stall holding infected raccoon dogs was more parsimonious than two separately infected
*  laboratory workers carrying their infections independently to the same market. Partly that's
*  because of geography. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, as John Stewart tried to say,
*  is indeed in the city of Wuhan, but it sits on the other side of the Yangtze River,
*  more than seven miles as the crow flies from the Huanan market.
*  Beginning early this year, the popularity of the lab accident idea, which grew steadily from 2020
*  through 2022, received several additional boosts. On February 26, the Wall Street Journal reported
*  that the U.S. Department of Energy, one of the organizations assigned earlier by President Biden
*  to study the origin question, offered a new judgment. Previously undecided, the DOE's
*  intelligence people now concluded, though with low confidence, that the pandemic most likely began
*  from a lab leak. The journal's reporters had this from a classified intelligence report,
*  unavailable for scrutiny by the public, but delivered to the White House and
*  key members of Congress who were unidentified. The next day, CNN's website posted a follow-up
*  story stating that three sources, also unidentified, had told CNN that the DOE
*  based its shift partly on information about research done at the Wuhan Center for Disease
*  Control and Prevention, another disease-related facility in the city more than seven miles from
*  the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This caught my attention, because I knew that the Wuhan CDC,
*  having recently relocated, was now just a few hundred yards from the Huanan market.
*  It occurred to me, disquietingly, that a virus leak from the center might fit the spatial clustering
*  of early cases around the market, as analyzed by Waraby and his colleagues,
*  in a way that a putative leak from the WIV did not. But nothing more on that provocative
*  assertion has come from CNN or from any other news outlet in the month since. I was reminded
*  that the Wuhan CDC moved to its new location near the market only on December 2, 2019. That date,
*  plus the time presumably needed to bring laboratory work back online, might not jibe
*  with a viral outbreak that most likely began in late November. In any case, two different sources
*  with good access to the Chinese research community told me that the Wuhan CDC, as distinct from the
*  National CDC in Beijing, had no coronavirus research program before the pandemic. One of
*  those sources, Jane Chu, a China-born independent journalist, added that the Wuhan group's mandate
*  was mainly technical tasks such as disease surveillance rather than research. Chu couldn't
*  name her own sources due to their potential jeopardy in China. Still more recently, in mid-June,
*  came the Substack article I alluded to earlier, claiming that Ben Hu and two others from Shengli
*  Xi's lab were the first people infected by the virus and therefore the starting point of the
*  pandemic. Hosted by Michael Schellenberger and two co-authors, this article cited unidentified
*  sources within the U.S. government. Hu was the first author on a 2017 paper describing the Xi
*  group's discovery of multiple coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 in bats from a cave,
*  not the Mojiang Mine, in southern China, and experimental work on three of those viruses
*  that some critics considered risky. Hu and the other two scientists, according to Schellenberger
*  and his co-authors, had contracted COVID-19-like illnesses in November 2019, suggesting that they
*  were the conduits of a lab leak. Hu himself promptly denied the allegation in an email to
*  John Cohen at Science, I did not get sick in autumn 2019 and did not have COVID-19-like
*  symptoms at that time. Furthermore, Hu told Cohen he and both colleagues had tested negative for
*  signs of recent COVID infection—antibodies—in March 2020. The surge of opinion toward the lab
*  leak idea was interrupted in March when Florence Daybar, a scientist working for France's National
*  Center for Scientific Research, discovered another body of interesting evidence, long missing but
*  now found. This was genomic data from the swab sampling of door surfaces and equipment and other
*  items, including that pair of discarded gloves, gathered at the Huanan Market in early 2020 but
*  withheld since that time. The data were released, perhaps by mistake, and Daybar was alert enough
*  to spot them and recognize what they were. A team of researchers, including Waraby, detected a
*  pattern in the data. Strong proximity between samples containing raccoon dog DNA and others
*  containing SARS-CoV-2 fragments, and some samples that contained both, from stalls in the southwest
*  corner of the market where wild animals had been sold as food. Malayan porcupine DNA and a more
*  hedgehog DNA were also found near the virus, but raccoon dogs were of special interest because of
*  their proven susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. These findings didn't establish that raccoon dogs had
*  carried the virus into the market, but they added plausibility and detail to that scenario.
*  Notwithstanding the Daybar Group's revelations, the lab leak idea has remained strongly preferred
*  by public opinion, and not just in the United States. According to one poll, as of April 2023,
*  62% of Italian respondents, 56% in France, and 50% in the United Kingdom found the lab leak idea
*  most compelling, sizable segments of undecided and flummoxed people leaving only modest minorities
*  embracing natural spillover. Earlier polling showed lab-related scenarios even more strongly
*  favored in still other countries, ranging from 73% in Kenya and 64% in Hungary to 58% in Brazil.
*  Various factors may account for this public drift to the lab leak hypothesis.
*  In my view, a preponderance of empirical evidence is not one of them. I agree it's
*  important to remain open-minded toward a lab leak possibility, but most of the arguments made in
*  support of that possibility boil down to conjecture from circumstance and unsupported accusations.
*  To speak of a lab leak hypothesis in the singular is, of course, misleading. There are multiple lab
*  leak hypotheses, just as there are multiple ways a natural spillover could have occurred.
*  A more encompassing and emollient phrase is research-related incident,
*  preferred by Jamie Metzl and some other critics. That covers several possibilities,
*  including the chance that misbegotten gain-of-function research at the WIV or the
*  Wuhan CDC or who knows where yielded a dangerous new hybrid virus that escaped through a
*  malfunctioning autoclave or an infected technician or grad student. In support of this scenario,
*  proponents point to a grant proposal known as Diffuse, made by EcoHealth Alliance to a
*  U.S. defense research agency in 2018, though never funded, for experiments that some critics
*  construe as potentially dangerous gain-of-function research. Another research-related
*  possibility, the nightmare that some Chinese bio warfare program created a murderous virus
*  intentionally but led it escape to the world by some catastrophic goof. Still another,
*  the notion that a scientific field worker became infected while taking samples from bats in,
*  say, the Mojang Mine, where Cheng Lishi's team found RATG-13.
*  They're all vivid, but not all logical. And it seems to me they don't reinforce one another.
*  If a wild coronavirus from the Mojang Mine was capable of infecting and transmitting among
*  humans, for instance, then it didn't need a furan cleavage site to be inserted during
*  reckless or malevolent lab work. And if it infected a scientific field worker in 2013,
*  and that field worker returned to Wuhan, where did the virus linger for six years
*  before exploding through the city's population in 2019? And if the virus was engineered in Xi's lab
*  using sophisticated gene editing methods or was transformed into this dangerous pathogen by
*  passaging a less dangerous virus through cell cultures or living mice, which seems far-fetched,
*  and then subsequently escaped, then the Mojang Mine, with all its sinister narrative appeal,
*  irrelevant. In other words, the various research-related incident hypotheses may
*  each be plausible, some more than others, but they compete against one another. You can't
*  pile them all on the scale and judge the likelihood of an unnatural origin by their combined weight.
*  Lab leak partisans have focused intently on Xi and her lab. But it's important to bear in mind that Xi
*  has made her career by publishing research and issuing warnings about potentially dangerous
*  coronaviruses found in the wild, not by keeping them secret. If she had such a
*  formidably dangerous virus in her lab in 2018 or 2019, a virus similar to the original SARS virus,
*  but with a receptor-binding domain and a furan cleavage site well-shaped for human infection,
*  features that could make it even more dangerous, she presumably would have announced that important
*  discovery from the pages of a leading journal, to her professional gain as well as the benefit
*  of the world. She didn't. And there's a small body of lost evidence recently recovered that
*  seems to support this logic. In 2018, a scientist named Jia Chou led a study of SARS-related
*  coronaviruses in bats. His purpose was to illuminate the evolution of the original SARS virus by
*  placing it on a family tree of its relatives. Chou had been a postdoctoral fellow in Eddie
*  Holmes' lab, going from there to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for a couple of years,
*  then to a position in Shanghai. Chou and a group of colleagues, including both Holmes and Cheng
*  Liqi, analyzed partial genome sequences of 60 coronaviruses detected in bat samples collected
*  from 2011 to 2016. They wrote a paper and submitted it to a leading virology journal.
*  It was rejected. They tried another. Rejected. The journal's reviewers wanted complete genome
*  sequences, but the team had only partials. So in October 2018, they gave up on that paper.
*  They pulled it from the submission process. They forgot about it. In the meantime, they had
*  submitted their partial but telling genome data to an international database, GenBank,
*  with a routine stipulation that it would be embargoed, in this case for four years.
*  The embargo allowed them to retain exclusive access to the data for that period in the event
*  they wanted to revive the project. Four years passed, and then in October 2022,
*  the embargo expired. The data, mothballed since just before the pandemic and now publicly available,
*  were revealing for what they did not include, a progenitor of the pandemic virus.
*  Here were 60 coronaviruses that Cheng Liqi and others had considered intriguing in 2018,
*  but nothing that matched SARS-CoV-2.
*  Where's the virus, said Eddie Holmes, recounting this to me recently.
*  The virus is absolutely not there. Two other arguments on the lab leak side deserve attention.
*  Each can be phrased as a question. Why did SARS-CoV-2 from the start seem to be very well
*  adapted to humans? And why, if its natural host was some kind of bat, has that host not
*  yet been found after three and a half years? The first of those questions ignores the fact
*  that SARS-CoV-2 has shown itself from the beginning to be quite capable of infecting other mammals,
*  cats and dogs, and eventually a wide range of them, tigers, gorillas, mink, white-tailed deer,
*  and others, not just humans. The second question betrays a lack of familiarity with the history
*  of emerging viruses. When a novel virus appears suddenly in humans, causing disease and alarm,
*  the search for its natural host is always an urgent task. But such ecological work is difficult
*  to do amid the public health emergency of an outbreak, and once the outbreak, or epidemic,
*  or pandemic, is controlled, the sense of urgency and the available research money tend to disappear.
*  Finding the host animal is sometimes easy, by luck, and sometimes hard. Identifying horseshoe bats
*  with high confidence as the likely host of the original SARS virus took fifteen years.
*  Tracing the Marburg virus to its reservoir host in Egyptian fruit bats took forty-one years,
*  or forty-two if you count the time to publication. And the natural host of Ebola virus, despite what
*  you may think you've heard, is still unidentified, forty-seven years after its emergence at a remote
*  mission hospital in what was then Zaire. The suggested linkage between Ebola virus and
*  some form of bat is still suppositional, not settled scientific fact, and we have enough
*  suppositions entangled with this subject already.
*  So what's tilting the scales of popular opinion toward Lableek? The answer to that is not embedded
*  deeply in the arcane data I've been skimming through here. What's tilting the scales, it seems to me,
*  is cynicism and narrative appeal. I asked about this in conversation with David Relman,
*  the biosecurity expert who is also an author of the Investigate Letter with Jesse Blum.
*  To some extent, Relman agreed. When you sow the seeds of distrust or suggest that you haven't
*  been transparent with what you knew, he told me, you're setting yourself up for a persistent,
*  insidious, continuing distrust. That inclines people to assume that there was something
*  deliberate or deliberately concealed. The seeds of distrust have been growing in America's
*  civic garden and the world's for a long time. More than sixty percent of Americans, according
*  to polling within the past several years, still declined to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acting
*  alone killed John F. Kennedy. Is that because people have read the Warren Commission report,
*  found it unpersuasive, and minutely scrutinized the magic bullet theory? No. It's because they've
*  learned to be distrustful and because a conspiracy theory of any big event is more dramatic and
*  satisfying than a small, stupid explanation. Like the notion that a feckless loser could kill a
*  president by hitting two out of three shots with a thirteen dollar rifle.
*  Most of us don't reach our opinions by fastidious calibration of empirical evidence.
*  We default to our priors, as Jesse Blum noted, or we embrace stories that have simple plots,
*  good and bad characters, and melodramatic trajectories, and that seem commensurate in
*  scope to the event in question. The process of scientific discovery is a complicated story
*  involving data collection, hypothesis testing, hypothesis falsification, hypothesis revision,
*  further testing, and brilliant but fallible humans doing all that work.
*  Scientific malfeasance driven by hubris and leading to runaway trouble, on the other hand,
*  is a much simpler story that goes back at least to Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein.
*  Carl Bergstrom is an evolutionary biologist and an author of commentaries on scientific
*  misinformation. He ponders, among other things, how students of science are taught, or at least
*  should be taught, about not just what science says, but what science is. I asked Bergstrom
*  about the human affinity for dark theories of big events. There was something about that in Thomas
*  Hardy, he told me. It's in Tess of the D'Urbervilles, where Tess is doomed by hapless chance. It really
*  sucks to live in a world where we are at the mercy of hapless chance. I had never read Tess of the
*  D'Urbervilles to my embarrassment, so I stuck with SARS-CoV-2. This is not a contest now in the
*  public domain between bodies of evidence, I proposed. This is a contest between stories.
*  Yeah, Bergstrom said. That's right.
