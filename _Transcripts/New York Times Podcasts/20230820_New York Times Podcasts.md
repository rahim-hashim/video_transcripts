*  Hi, this is David Kwaman. I'm an author and journalist and I've been writing articles
*  and books about emerging diseases and novel viruses for the past two decades.
*  This week's Sunday Read is a story of mine about the origins of the COVID virus.
*  We still don't know with total certainty how the coronavirus pandemic started. Where
*  did that virus come from? Earlier this year, I saw that the idea of a lab leak
*  origin was becoming more popular, even though there was no increase in evidence
*  to support that hypothesis. And that imbalance concerned me, it puzzled me.
*  So, in this piece I wrote for the New York Times magazine, I explored two
*  questions that are still controversial more than three and a half years into
*  this pandemic. First, what is the origin of the virus known as SARS-CoV-2? Where
*  did it come from? And second, why is the preponderance of evidence on one side
*  of the debate and the preponderance of public opinion on another? So, the
*  origins debate centers on three main hypotheses. The first is the natural
*  origin hypothesis, the idea that the virus spilled over from a wild animal,
*  probably an animal that had been brought to the infamous wet market, the
*  wanawn market in Wuhan, China, and was being sold for food. The second
*  hypothesis argues that the COVID virus is a bio weapon that was intentionally
*  engineered and released to infect people. And then there is a third theory, the
*  lab leak hypothesis. It suggests that a lab worker in Wuhan was doing research
*  on coronaviruses, possibly altering a virus's genome to see if certain
*  alterations would make it more dangerous to humans. And then this lab worker,
*  so the theory goes, got infected with the virus and carried it out into the
*  world. And that became the pandemic. Now, I want to emphasize that we still don't
*  know for sure which of these hypotheses is true. We don't have the final gold
*  standard of proof. But while the evidence is heavily on the side of a natural
*  origin, there's quite a bit of inclination among the public and not just in the
*  US to believe that COVID came from a lab leak. The story you're about to hear
*  gets into why that is and why it matters. So here's my article, the ongoing
*  mystery of COVID's origin. Read for you by Eduardo Balarini.
*  Where did it come from? More than three years into the pandemic and untold
*  millions of people dead. That question about the COVID-19 coronavirus remains
*  controversial and fraught with facts sparkling amid a tangle of analyses and
*  hypotheticals like Christmas lights strung on a dark thorny tree. One school of
*  thought holds that the virus known to sciences SARS-CoV-2 spilled into humans
*  from a non-human animal, probably in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, a
*  messium, porium, and Wuhan China, brimming with fish, meats, and wildlife on sale
*  as food. Another school argues that the virus was laboratory engineered to infect
*  humans and cause them harm, a bio-weapon, and was possibly devised in a shadow
*  project sponsored by the People's Liberation Army of China. A third school, more
*  moderate than the second, but also implicating laboratory work, suggests that
*  the virus got into its first human victim by wave and accident at the Wuhan Institute
*  of Virology, WIV, a research complex on the eastern side of the city. Maybe
*  after well-meaning, but reckless genetic manipulation that made it more dangerous
*  to people. If you feel confused by these possibilities, undecided, suspicious of
*  over-confident assertions, or just tired of the whole subject of the pandemic and
*  whatever little bug is caused it, be assured that you aren't the only one. Some
*  contrarians say that it doesn't matter the source of the virus. What matters they
*  say is how we cope with the catastrophe it has brought. The illness and death, it
*  continues to cause. Those contrarians are wrong. It does matter. Research priorities,
*  pandemic preparedness around the world, health policies and public opinion towards
*  science itself will be lastingly affected by the answer to the origin question, if
*  we ever get a definitive answer. But much of the evidence that might provide that
*  answer has either been lost or is still unavailable. Lost because of failures to
*  gather relevant material promptly, unavailable because of intransigence and
*  concealment, particularly on the part of Chinese official domestic levels. Take the
*  natural spillover hypothesis for instance, and assume that the virus passed to
*  humans from a wild animal. Maybe a raccoon dog, a fox like K9, or a malein
*  porcupine, somewhere in the Huanan market. To test that hypothesis you would want
*  samples of blood, feces or mucus taken from the raccoon dogs, porcupines and
*  other wildlife that languished, caged and doomed in the market. You would screen
*  those samples for signs of the virus. If you found the virus itself, or at least
*  sizable bits of its genome, you would then make a comparative analysis of genomes,
*  including some from the earliest human cases to deduce whether people got the
*  virus from the wildlife or vice versa. But you can't do that because whatever
*  raccoon dogs or porcupines or other wild animals run sale in the market during
*  December 2019, advanced by January 1st, 2020. On that date, the market was closed
*  by order of Chinese authorities, with no reported effort to sample the most
*  suspect forms of wildlife. Or take the lab engineered bio-weapon hypothesis, as
*  recently offered in an article in the Sunday Times of London. The two times
*  reporters cited unidentified US investigators, who scrutinized top secret
*  intercepted communications, and concluded that the Chinese military was supporting
*  a covert project to develop a weaponized coronavirus. The article also
*  posited a related vaccine effort to protect China's populace once the killer
*  virus was unleashed on the world. It's a riveting narrative. The virus
*  engineering occurred, according to this account, at the Wuhan Institute of
*  Eirology. The reporters didn't name their intelligence sources or supply
*  evidence to make their allegations concrete, but if they did, it would be
*  explosive news. Or take the lab leak scenario, some versions of which point
*  accusingly at a non-profit organization in New York, Eco-Health Alliance, and its
*  collaborative relationship with Dr. Shanli Xi, a senior researcher at the WIV.
*  Xi and her team study coronaviruses, especially those carried by bats,
*  extracting fragments of viral RNA, the molecule in which coronavirus genomes are
*  written, and occasionally live virus, from samples of guano and other bodily
*  material and assembling whole genome sequences like jigsaw puzzles from the
*  fragments. They perform experiments, sometimes combining an element of one
*  virus with the backbone of another, to learn how that element might function in
*  the wild, and they publish scientific papers, warning which bad viruses could
*  pose a threat to humans. What if a researcher or technician under Xi's
*  leadership, handling a virus very much like SARS-CoV-2, became infected by accident
*  and then spread the infection to others? That question became from the early
*  months of the pandemic, a suspicion, and then a hypothesis, and then an accusation.
*  Even now, the trade in claims and counterclaims remains brisk. Last month in a
*  sub-stack newsletter called Public, three authors asserted, citing unnamed US
*  government officials, that one of the first people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was a
*  scientist named Ben Hu from Xi's lab. That assertion was significant and
*  important if true, but no proof or identified sourcing so far supports it.
*  Ten days later, the office of the Director of National Intelligence released,
*  as required by a law passed three months earlier, a declassified report
*  outlining whatever was known to the US intelligence community about potential links between
*  the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origins of the pandemic.
*  The report concluded, among other things, that WIV personnel had collaborated at times on
*  coronavirus work with scientists associated with the People's Liberation Army.
*  But that, so far as available evidence showed, such work involved no known viruses that could
*  plausibly be a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2.
*  And then on July 11th, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic led by
*  Representative Brad Wenshrup and Ohio Republican, convened a hearing at which he and colleagues
*  interrogated two scientists, Christian Anderson and Robert Gary, about their authorship of an
*  influential 2020 paper that appeared in the journal Nature Medicine. That paper was titled
*  The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2. The tenor of the hearing was foretold by its own announced
*  title, investigating the proximal origin of a cover-up, and the proceedings that day consisted of
*  accusation and defense without shedding any new light, let alone yielding certitude about the
*  origin of the virus. Certitude is an elusive goal and a high presumption, even for science,
*  even for a director of national intelligence, even for the chairman of a Select Congressional
*  Subcommittee. Philosophers have recognized that, and so have novelists and poets.
*  I was of three minds, wrote Wallace Stevens, like a tree in which there are three blackbirds.
*  In the poem, Stevens found thirteen different ways of looking at a blackbird.
*  There are at least that many ways of viewing the origin of SARS-CoV-2, and to do justice to the
*  question, you'll need, like him, to hold several possibilities in your mind at a time.
*  How do you regard a blackbird or an origin hypothesis maybe influenced by where you're coming from?
*  That's an old truth, but I was reminded of it during a conversation with Jesse Bloom,
*  an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle,
*  and one of the best qualified among those who argue that the lab leak hypothesis
*  deserves robust investigation. Bloom studies the evolution of viruses, for two reasons.
*  It happens fast, and therefore illuminates evolution in general, and it has large implications
*  for public health. When I spoke with him back in February 2021, a year into the pandemic,
*  and asked about the origin question, Bloom said, I think what you have is a lot of people strongly
*  defaulting to their prior beliefs. Scientists who study zoonotic diseases, those that spill over from
*  non-human animals into people, might be inclined to assume a natural origin. Scientists who have
*  long argued against the risks of gain of function, research, experimental work exploring the evolutionary
*  capacities of potentially dangerous pathogens, might readily assume a lab leak. National security
*  experts with strong views of the oppressive, secretive Chinese government might lean towards scenarios
*  involving Chinese malfeasance and cover-up. More recently, Bloom told me that his own prior
*  inclination would be toward a natural spillover, but you certainly wouldn't think it's like 99.99%
*  the most likely explanation, he said, adding there could be other possibilities.
*  That gave me pause to consider my own priors. For the past 40 years, I've written non-fiction
*  about the natural world and the sciences that study it, especially ecology and evolutionary biology.
*  During the first half of that, my attention went mainly to large visible creatures like bears,
*  crocodiles and bumblebees, and to wild places like the Amazon jungle, and the Sonoran desert.
*  I came to the subject of emerging viruses in 1999, during a National Geographic assignment,
*  when I walked for 10 days through Ebola virus habitat in a central African forest.
*  Later I spent five years writing a book about zoonotic diseases and the agents that caused them,
*  including the SARS virus, the earlier killer coronavirus, now often called SARS-CoV-1,
*  which emerged in 2002 and spread in human travelers from Hong Kong to Singapore, Toronto and elsewhere,
*  alarming experts deeply. Scientists traced SARS-CoV-1 to Palm Civits, a type of cat-like wild carnivore
*  sold as food in some South China markets and restaurants. But the civits proved to be intermediate
*  hosts, and its natural host was later identified as horseshoe bats. The story of SARS is only one
*  chapter in the saga of dangerous new viruses emerging from animals. The grim tale of how HIV got
*  into humans and caused the AIDS pandemic is another, a tale known partly by inference and partly by
*  molecular evidence and traceable back to a single blood-mingling event between a person and a chimpanzee,
*  probably hunter and hunted, in the southeastern corner of Cameroon around the start of the 20th century.
*  Human contact with non-human animals accounts for our influences as well, which usually emerge
*  from wild aquatic birds. Hendra virus in Australia comes to humans from bats, generally through an
*  intermediate host, horses. Machupe virus in Bolivia abides in rodents when not infecting people.
*  Huntone virus discovered in Korea and its relative Sinombre virus in the American Southwest
*  also spill over from rodents. Nipa virus and Bangladesh in some surrounding countries comes from bats.
*  It's excreted in bat feces, saliva and urine, and when certain fruit bats visit date palm trees
*  that are being tapped for their sugary sap, a custom in Bangladesh, the virus contaminates the sap,
*  which is sold fresh on the street to local customers, some of whom die. These cases and many others
*  like them are among my own priors, and no doubt they do incline me toward the idea of natural spillover.
*  It happens often, sometimes with dire consequences. Research accidents have occurred too in the history
*  of dangerous new viruses, and long time concerns over such accidents constricted to priors of some
*  who favor the lably hypothesis for COVID. Such accidents might number in the hundreds or the thousands,
*  depending on where you put the threshold of significance and how you define accident.
*  There was an event that probably reintroduced a 1950s strain of influenza in 1977,
*  causing that year's flu pandemic, which killed many thousands of people. At a 2004 needle stick
*  injury of a careful scientist, Kelly Warfield, while she was doing Ebola research, but she proved
*  uninfected by Ebola. Also in 2004, just a year after the global SARS-SKR, two workers at a
*  virology lab in Beijing were independently infected with that virus, which spread to nine people in total,
*  one of whom died. This followed two other single case lab accident infections with SARS virus the
*  previous year, one in Singapore, one in Taiwan. When the first known cases of an atypical pneumonia
*  began turning up at Wuhan hospitals in late 2019, and then exploded into a coronavirus outbreak in
*  early 2020, the location itself seemed to fit in different ways, the priors that might incline one
*  toward either a natural origin explanation or a lab leak explanation. The potential lab leak
*  connection was easiest to note. The city contained a research facility, the Wuhan Institute of
*  Virology, with a well-known laboratory devoted to coronavirus research. On the other hand, Wuhan was
*  also a major nexus for the significant national trade in wild animals for food, fur, and traditional
*  medicines, estimated at more than 70 billion dollars annually, where such creatures and the viruses
*  they carry were sold at many crowded markets, one of which, Guanan, Lai-at or near the center of the
*  spatial pattern of earliest known cases. So starting from simply those circumstances,
*  was a lab accident more likely than a natural spillover? And under either of those scenarios,
*  how much did Chinese government pressure and obscuritism constrain the availability of evidence
*  for assessing one or the other? Because there exists no definitive account, yet, of the particular
*  events that delivered SARS-CoV-2 into the human population, even experts are forced to frame their
*  views as probabilities, based on data and circumstance, influenced rariously by prior beliefs
*  as to how the world works. In assessing the probabilities for yourself, you might want to step back
*  from the noise, anger, vitriol, and politicization that have clouded the controversy and focus on the
*  evidence we do have. To that end, it may help to note some events in the order they occurred.
*  On January 11, 2020, in Shanghai, just 11 days after first reports of the outbreak in Wuhan
*  circulated globally, a team of scientists led by Yongcheng-Chang of Fudan University released a
*  draft genome sequence of the novel virus through a website called virological.org. The genome was
*  provided by Edward C. Holmes, a British Australian evolutionary biologist based in Sydney,
*  and a colleague of Changs on the genome assembly project. Holmes is famous among
*  virologists for his work on the evolution of RNA viruses, including coronaviruses,
*  his pristinely bald head, and his mortent candor. Everyone in the field knows him as Eddie.
*  The posting went up at 105 am Scotland time, at which point the curator of the site there in Edinburgh,
*  a professor of molecular evolution named Andrew Rambo, was alert and ready to speed things along.
*  He and Holmes composed a brief introductory note to the genome.
*  Please feel free to download, share, use, and analyze this data, it's it. They knew that data is
*  plural, but they ran a hurry. Immediately, Holmes and a small group of colleagues set to analyzing
*  the genome for clues about the virus's evolutionary history. They drew on a background of known
*  coronaviruses and their own understanding of how such viruses take shape in the wild. As reflected
*  in Holmes's 2009 book, The Evolution and Emergence of RNA Viruses, they knew that coronaviruses
*  evolution can occur rapidly, driven by frequent mutation, single letter changes in a roughly 30,000
*  letter genome, by recombination, one virus swapping genome sections with another virus when both
*  simultaneously replicate in a single cell, and by Darwinian natural selections acting on those
*  random changes. Holmes traded thoughts with Rambo and Edinburgh, a friend of three decades, and with
*  two other colleagues, Christian Anderson at Scripps Research in LaHoya, California, and Robert
*  Gary at the Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans. In Lippkin of Columbia University's
*  mailman school of public health, joined the Huddled Later. These five would form a sort of
*  long-distance study group, aimed toward publishing a paper on SARS-CoV-2's genome, and it's likely origin.
*  Holmes, Anderson, and their colleagues recognize the virus's similarity to bat viruses,
*  but with more study saw a pair of notable features that gave them pause. Those features,
*  two short blips of genome, constituted a very small percentage of the whole, but with potentially
*  high significance for the virus's ability to grab and infect human cells. They were technical
*  sounding elements familiar to varologists that are now part of the COVID origin vernacular,
*  a furan cleavage site, FCS, as well as an unexpected receptor binding domain, RBD.
*  All viruses have RBDs, which help them attach to cells, and FCS is a feature that helps certain
*  viruses get inside. The original SARS virus, which terrified scientists worldwide, but caused
*  only about 800 deaths, didn't resemble the new coronavirus in either respect.
*  How had SARS-CoV-2 come to take this form? Anderson and Holmes were genuinely concerned at first
*  that it might have been engineered, where those two features deliberate add-ons, inserted into some
*  coronavirus backbone by genetic manipulation, intentionally making the virus more transmissible
*  and pathogenic among humans? It had to be considered. Holmes called Jeremy Ferrar, a disease expert
*  who was then director of the Welcome Trust, a foundation in London that supports health research.
*  Ferrar saw the point and quickly arranged a conference call among an international group of
*  scientists to discuss the genome's puzzling aspects and the possible scenarios of its origin.
*  The group included Robert Garriott Tulane and a dozen other people, most of them distinguished
*  European or British scientists with relevant expertise, like Rambo and Edinburgh, Marian Coupmons
*  and the Netherlands and Christian Drosston in Germany. Also on the call were Anthony Fauci,
*  then head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Francis Collins,
*  then director of the National Institutes of Health and therefore Fauci's boss.
*  This is the famous February 1st call, on which, if you believe some critical voices,
*  Fauci and Collins persuaded the others to suppress any notion that the virus might have been engineered.
*  The narrative going around was that Fauci told us,
*  change our mind yada yada yada yada, we were paid off, Holmes said to me. It's complete.
*  Anderson concurred. There is no universe in which this would even be possible, he told me.
*  Recently based on selections of their private email and slack traffic made public,
*  Anderson and his colleagues have been accused of concealment and dissembling.
*  Their messages, critics contend, proved that even as they were deeply concerned in private
*  about the engineered virus or lab release possibilities, they were striving to keep both out of
*  public discussion. But as the researchers describe it, these apparent contradictions were simply
*  a reflection of their fast evolving views. After initial concern that the receptor binding domain
*  and SARS-CoV-2 might be a sign of engineering, for instance, they learned soon after the
*  February 1st conference call of a very similar RBD in a coronavirus that infected pangolins.
*  It was detected from a public database by a bioinformatician in Houston,
*  Matt Wong, and posted on the virological website, where it eventually came to the group's attention.
*  It showed that such an RBD had evolved in the wild and might well have gotten into SARS-CoV-2
*  by recombination, the natural gene-swapping process. Anderson and the others also recognized that
*  furan cleavage sites occur naturally in other coronaviruses, like the MERS virus, though not,
*  as so far detected in any other member of the subgenus to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs.
*  Such new data led to a new conclusion, and what Anderson called on Twitter, a clear example
*  of the scientific process. Sixteen days after the conference call they posted a pre-print,
*  a draft not yet peer-reviewed of their paper, and four weeks later it appeared in the journal
*  Nature Medicine. This was the one titled The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
*  Anderson and his co-author stated their conclusion at the top.
*  Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully
*  manipulated virus. That still left the possibility of a natural virus, evolved in an animal host
*  and passed into humans by zoanotic transfer, or perhaps a natural virus accidentally leaked.
*  Near the papers end they stated something more nuanced, that while intentional engineering of
*  the virus could be ruled out, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories
*  of its origin described here. That said, they added, we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based
*  scenario is plausible.
*  One other coronavirus quickly came to light as the closest known match to SARS-CoV-2.
*  This wasn't actually a virus in the flesh, in physical presence. It was a genome sequence,
*  assembled from RNA fragments extracted from a fecal swab sample of a bat, captured in a mine
*  several years earlier in 2013. The mine was in Yunnan province, 1,200 miles southwest of Wuhan.
*  The genome was 96.2% identical to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, assembled from people during the early days of
*  the pandemic. Bat degree of similarity, or a 3.8% difference, suggests a common virus ancestor
*  some years ago, and independent evolution in the years since. So this represented a cousin to SARS-CoV-2,
*  not its progenitor. The work of sampling the bat and assembling the sequence, first just a portion,
*  then with better technology, nearly the whole thing, had been led by Shang Li Xi at the Wuhan
*  Institute of Eirology. She and her team labeled the sequence RATG13, coding the facts that it came
*  from an individual of Rinalofus aphonus, R.A., the intermediate horseshoe bat, captured in that mine
*  in Tongguan, TG, a town in the Mojyang District of Yunnan in 2013. RATG13 has attained Rinal,
*  not just because a constituted strong evidence of SARS-CoV-2's ancestry in bat viruses,
*  but also because the Mojyang mine figures in some of the more lurid scenarios for a lab leak origin.
*  Part of what makes the very name Mojyang seem lurid is that in 2012, three workers at the mine
*  died of unidentified respiratory infections after days of underground labor there. What got into
*  their lungs and killed them? Was it a fungus? Was it a virus? Some lab leak proponents suggest that
*  those deaths described in two obscure medical feces written in Mandarin represent the earliest
*  known fatalities from a virus, possibly RATG13, that either already was, or in Xi's lab,
*  became SARS-CoV-2 or its immediate progenitor, that is something far more similar than a cousin.
*  The inference is that Xi's team, a year after the mine workers died, may have taken the virus back
*  to Wuhan. But the Mojyang deaths were also reported in 2014 in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases
*  by scientists who found an entirely different virus, also potentially dangerous because it had
*  similarities to Nipah and Hendra viruses and was carried in the Mojyang mine by rats, not bats.
*  One take away? Sample the rats and bats and other fauna in a mine, and you might
*  well find a variety of viruses you wouldn't want in your lungs.
*  Another problem with the RATG13 scenario. Its genome differs from that of SARS-CoV-2
*  at more than 1,100 scattered positions throughout its genome.
*  To engineer SARS-CoV-2 into existence by starting with RATG13 would have been unreasonable
*  and impractical, according to Holmes and other experts in coronavirus genomics.
*  Furthermore, it's important to remember that RATG13 was a genome sequence, not a live virus.
*  It was information, not a biological entity. Coaxing a virus that lies dormant in Bat Guano
*  to grow in a cell culture is difficult, and usually the effort fails.
*  Shang Li Ji told John Cohen, a senior correspondent for the journal Science, in her answer to a set of
*  emailed questions that she never grew RATG13 in her lab. She told me the same thing during a two-hour
*  conversation by Zoom. No, no, we couldn't culture any of the sample from this cave at Mojyang.
*  She was in Shanghai for a conference in the night of December 30, 2019, as she explained it to me,
*  when word reached her about a mysterious respiratory illness spreading dangerously among people
*  back in Wuhan. Preliminary lab results suggested a coronavirus, not SARS virus, but something similar
*  might be the cause. She was asked to help identify the thing. She put her lab team to work on
*  that immediately and took a train back to Wuhan the next day. Within hours, her lab had received
*  a partial sequence from another lab. Her first instinct was to compare it with sequences of viruses
*  they had worked on themselves, and we found it's different, she told me. So the afternoon of December 31,
*  I already know it's nothing related to what we have done in our laboratory.
*  Some critics, she was well aware, had suggested that her urgency in checking her own records
*  was an implicit admission of error or guilt. Its normal was her response.
*  John Cohen mentioned the possibility of a lab leak in a report published in Science on January 31, 2020,
*  noting that not all the earliest confirmed cases had some direct link to the Huanan market.
*  14 of the first 41, according to one study, did not. Might those people have picked up their
*  infections somewhere else, and maybe not from an animal at all? After describing a couple of vivid
*  but unsupported allegations, including the idea that SARS-CoV-2 resembled a snake virus,
*  and snakes were sold at Wuhan Wet Markets, Cohen added, the Wuhan Institute of Virology,
*  which is the premier lab in China that studies bat in human coronaviruses, has also come under fire.
*  Concerns had been voiced, he wrote, about the security of the WIV's biosefty procedures and
*  facilities. Evidence regarding the origin of the virus, apart from what could be read from the
*  genome itself, remains scarce during those early months. In place of evidence, it was the weight of
*  scientific authority on one side and the volume of outcry on the other. On February 19, 2020,
*  an open letter appeared online in The Lancet, a British journal, signed by 27 scientists,
*  some of them eminent senior figures in Virology and Public Health, others, researchers in the full
*  heat of distinguished careers. It was a statement of solidarity with Chinese scientists and health
*  professionals, who were then on the front line in efforts to understand and control the virus.
*  The letter was organized by Peter Dasek, a British American disease ecologist,
*  president of EcoHealth Alliance, and a collaborator with Shang Li Xi.
*  Besides voicing support for Chinese colleagues, it said,
*  we stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19
*  does not have a natural origin. That expression of confidence so soon would prove to be counterproductive,
*  and the phrase, conspiracy theories landed like bacon grease thrown into a campfire,
*  causing skeptics to flare and sizzle.
*  The lab leak idea, meanwhile, took hold in some political circles, partly because
*  a dovetailed with attitudes toward the Chinese government, its repressive policies and its
*  pension for secrecy. In late January 2020, even before Cohen's January 31st article,
*  the Washington Times ran an article suggesting links between the WIV and a covert bio-weapons
*  program of the Chinese military. The article, later walked back with an editor's note,
*  was based largely on assertions by a former Israeli military intelligence officer.
*  Several weeks afterward, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas voiced a similar suspicion about the
*  Wuhan lab on Fox News. We don't have evidence that this disease originated there, Cotton said,
*  but because of China's duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the
*  question. Soon enough, Donald Trump's mind began to change. The president spoke
*  supportively about China throughout the early weeks of the pandemic, and on February 7th,
*  said of President Xi Jinping, I think he's handled it really well. Then the winds shifted,
*  and four months later, Trump was inciting Israeli crowds by calling COVID-19 the KUNG flu.
*  The attractions of the lab leak idea weren't entirely partisan.
*  Jamie Metzel is an author and political commentator who worked in the Clinton administration,
*  and at one point as a Senate committee staff member working closely with Senator Joe Biden.
*  Metzel has a blindingly luminescent and liberal-tinged resume that includes a PhD from Oxford,
*  a JD from Harvard Law School, a senior fellowship at the Atlantic Council, and 13 Ironman triathlons.
*  A former member of the WHO Expert Advisory Committee on Human Genome editing,
*  Metzel called early on for an investigation into the origins of the pandemic,
*  including, in his words, the distinct possibility this crisis may stem from a research-related
*  incident in Wuhan. Having spoken up about this in the early months of 2020, Metzel encountered
*  resistance that seems to have startled and aggrieved him. When I was seeing this different story,
*  he told me, and I started speaking publicly about it, friends of mine would say two things.
*  The first was, you're a progressive liberal Democrat, but you're delivering a message that's
*  helpful to Trump. Implication, Metzel should get back on the right side of scrimmage.
*  The second sort of comment he says was, who the F are you? You have all these senior scientists
*  and Nobel laureates and others who are saying it comes from nature? Who the F are you to say that
*  based on your analysis and your deductive reasoning, you have additional questions?
*  The proselytizing by Metzel and others who saw a different story from natural spillover,
*  plus the swing of Trump's message, plus the prevailing cultural disposition to distrust experts,
*  plus no doubt other factors, had an effect on public opinion and media attention,
*  if not on scientific consensus. According to the Pew Research Center,
*  polling Americans in March 2020, 43% believed that the virus emerged naturally,
*  against less than 30% who thought it came from a lab, developed either by accident or intentional.
*  By September 2020, another polling organization found the Natural Versus Lab options embraced
*  almost equally. By June 2021, a Politico-Harvard poll put the lab origin idea ahead by a 2-to-1
*  march, 52% of Americans, versus 28%. Metzel himself has maintained the somewhat
*  agnostic position that accidental release is a possibility, but not the only possibility.
*  In his eventual March 2023 testimony to Congress, he urged,
*  fully examining all relevant origins hypotheses, obviously including a lab origin,
*  but also a market origin, which some experts I respect believe to be more probable.
*  Among those experts, he cited Michael Wariby, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Arizona.
*  Wariby is a Canadian-born Oxford-educated scientist who speaks mildly and sometimes
*  entertains provocative theories. One such theory was OPV, the oral polio vaccine hypothesis
*  for the origin of the HIV AIDS pandemic. I first interviewed Wariby a dozen years ago to hear about
*  that. The OPV hypothesis asserted that the virus, HIV-1, group M, was put into humans inadvertently
*  during reckless trials of an oral polio vaccine on unsuspecting African volunteers,
*  including hundreds of thousands of children. The vaccine had been developed in chimpanzee cell
*  cultures, so the hypothesis claimed and contaminated with a chimpanzee virus that became HIV-1M.
*  In early 2000, Wariby left his doctoral studies in Oxford,
*  flew to a war zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and spent weeks collecting chimpanzee
*  dung in the forest to test that hypothesis. A senior partner on this wild cat expedition
*  was William Hamilton, a famous Oxford biologist who considered the OPV hypothesis plausible.
*  Wariby and Hamilton collected their chimpanzee samples with help from local forest guides and then
*  scrambled out of Kisangani, Wariby with his arm and a sling from a badly infected forest wound,
*  Hamilton desperately ill with malaria. They reached England and Hamilton died soon afterward from
*  complications. The samples got lost in baggage handling, then found, then tested negative for the
*  chimpanzee virus except for one sample that proved inconclusive. Such are the labors and frustrations
*  of science, Wariby along with other scientists drawing another evidence eventually showed that the
*  oral vaccine hypothesis was false. Open-mindedness toward a provocative hypothesis and a commitment
*  to confirm it or refute it as the evidence may dictate are among his priors.
*  Massars Kovie, too, 20 years later, Wariby likewise felt inclined to give the provocative
*  heterodox hypothesis all due consideration. Concerned by what he saw as premature dismissal of the
*  lab leak possibility, he signed a public letter in spring 2021 with 17 other scientists arguing that
*  greater clarity about the origins of this pandemic is necessary and feasible to achieve.
*  We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient
*  data. One of the letters other co-siners, in fact the first as listed, was Jesse Bloom.
*  Wariby had helped initiate the letter with emails to Bloom on March 21st of that year,
*  including the suggestion I have been thinking about something like a perspective in science or an
*  op-ed in the New York Times. The letter was initially drafted by Bloom and two others,
*  Alina Chan, a molecular biologist who was an author of a preprint in 2020, arguing that SARS-CoV-2
*  was already well adapted to infecting humans at the start, raising questions about its provenance,
*  and David Rehlman of Stanford, a distinguished microbiologist with a long-term concern about
*  biosecurity issues and some gain of function research. Others of the group contributed input
*  and the letter ran in science on May 14th, 2021, under the imperative title, investigate the origins
*  of COVID-19. But from that point, with passing months and more research, Wariby would diverge from
*  the most vocal of his co-siners regarding what constitutes sufficient data.
*  Strong tides of opinion were moving by Spring 2021, an international team of scientists
*  recruited by the World Health Organization to its joint WHO China study of the origins of SARS-CoV-2
*  had returned from a month in Wuhan and issued its Phase I report, finding a laboratory leak
*  extremely unlikely. That finding took criticism from Wariby, Bloom, and their co-authors of the
*  letter to science published weeks afterward. Even the Director General of the WHO himself, Dr.
*  Tegers Adnan-Gabriasis, hoped for further investigation. At a news conference marking the
*  report's publication, Tegeros said, as far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the
*  table, noting the need for continued research. Notwithstanding Tegros' hopes, and mainly because
*  of Chinese resistance, there has been no official Phase II follow-up study per se. Instead, the WHO
*  created a scientific advisory group for the origins of novel pathogens. Saygo, a body of disease
*  scientists who will continue to study the origins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other dangerous new bugs.
*  Maria van Kerkho, the technical lead for COVID at the WHO, has been vocal about the barriers to progress.
*  There's very little information that can be accessed with regard to lab leak, with regard to
*  breach of biosafety or biosecurity. And that's the problem, she told me recently, saying that she
*  had discussed the issue directly with Chinese officials. That's what's frustrating, she added,
*  with that lack of information, you're left with these gaping holes. Popular articles espousing the
*  lab leak idea also began to blossom forth around this time, in magazines and newspapers and on web
*  platforms. In January 2021, New York magazine carried a COVID-origin article by Nicholson Baker,
*  but lately published a book on American bioweapons research in the early 1950s and his frustrations
*  with the Freedom of Information Act. Baker now raised the, what if, question, about coronavirus
*  research? In May 2021, Nicholas Wade, who once worked for the New York Times, published a long
*  article in the bulletin of the atomic scientists describing the collaborations between Shangri-Li
*  Xi's lab and eco-health alliance. The research on bat-coronavirus as potential threats to human health.
*  Research that Wade suggested could have led to the escape of a virus intentionally made more
*  dangerous to humans. Soon afterward, another science writer with former connections to the Times,
*  Donald G. McNeil Jr. found himself moved by Wade's article to do further probing and questioning,
*  and posted a more judicious essay concluding, all we have so far is speculation, and all the
*  explanations are unsatisfactory. An early June vanity fair followed with a feature by the journalist
*  Catherine Ibn, suggesting that research at the WIV, or alternatively, field collection of
*  bat samples and the accidental infection of a field worker, might have put the virus engineered
*  or not into people. Ben came John Stewart. On June 14, 2021, the comedian appeared on Stephen
*  Colbert's show, and announced with sublime confidence and transcendent shallowness,
*  his grounds for certainty that the virus first detected in Wuhan had come from a Wuhan lab.
*  If you look at the name, he shouted, look at the name. Stewart got the name of the institution
*  wrong, in fact, he called WIV, the Wuhan novel respiratory coronavirus lab, though he got the name
*  of the city right. How much that mattered to Colbert's millions of viewers is unknown.
*  Throughout 2020 and 2021, scientists with deep expertise in relevant fields,
*  especially molecular evolutionary virology, veterinary virology, and molecular phylogenetics,
*  the drawing of family trees by comparison of genomes, or busy too.
*  Bear efforts added data and analyses to the natural origin side of the balance.
*  One study by two Chinese researchers and three Westerners showed that the wet markets in Wuhan,
*  not just the notorious Quanan, but also three others, contained numerous shops selling wild
*  animals for food from May 2017 to November 2019. The offerings included raccoon dogs,
*  masked palm civets, and malein porcupines. Many of the animals showed what seemed to be wounds from
*  gunshots or traps, suggesting harvest from the wild, as distinct from farm raised wildlife,
*  but like the requisite documentation to make their sale legal under China's wildlife protection law.
*  That's important because it gave local authorities incentive, as the pandemic spread
*  to close the market, as they did on January 1st, 2020, and conceal whatever illegality
*  said been ignored by enforcement officers there. For all the assumptions made about China's
*  motivation to cover up a lab leak, it's worth remembering that they would have had similar
*  motivations, including that $70 billion national industry, to cover up a devastatingly consequential
*  market leak. Another study published by Science in July 2022 with Michael Waribi's first author
*  joined by Eddie Holmes and Marion Cope-Munce and many others, considered the spatial pattern of
*  more than 150 of the earliest COVID-19 cases from December 2019. Waribi and colleagues found that
*  not only were Huanan market customers and workers, and people in contact with those customers or
*  workers, among those cases living close to the market, but so were patients with no known
*  epidemiological link to the market. Therefore, that market was the early epicenter of the pandemic,
*  as the papers titled declared. A distinct but related study that appeared around the same time
*  with Waribi and other co-authors, but in this case with Jonathan P. Carras' first author,
*  looked at the shape of the SARS-CoV-2 family tree. It was unexpected. As drawn from comparison of
*  genome sequence from human samples taken at the beginning of the pandemic, it consisted of two
*  thick limbs branching from a trunk, then each limb exploding into many tiny stems,
*  without intermediate branches. The two major limbs were lineages, labeled Lineage A and Lineage B,
*  from which all the viruses later diversity arose. Lineage B was the more prolific and successful,
*  accounting for most of the world's COVID-19 cases, including all early cases directly linked to
*  the market. Lineage A had been found in the market too by the Chinese team that swabbed after the
*  place was summarily closed. That smudge of A turned up on a pair of discarded gloves. Lineage A
*  was also detected in two COVID patients living near the market. P. Carras and his colleagues did a
*  high-tech analysis of the tree pattern, those two big limbs, then that explosion of twiggy stems from
*  each, and concluded that the virus probably entered humans multiple times. The outbreak of human
*  infections they judged most likely had at least two separate beginnings. Why did this finding
*  matter? Two spillovers into people from a market stall holding infected raccoon dogs
*  was more parsimonious than two separately infected laboratory workers carrying their infections
*  independently to the same market. Partly that's because of geography. The Wuhan Institute of
*  Virology, as John Stewart tried to say, is indeed in the city of Wuhan, but it sits on the other
*  side of the Yangtze River, more than seven miles as the crow flies from the Huanan market.
*  The
*  popularity of the lab accident idea, which russetally from 2020 through 2022, received several
*  additional boosts. On February 26, the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Department of
*  Energy, one of the organizations assigned earlier by President Biden to study the origin question,
*  offered a new judgment. Previously undecided, the DOE's intelligence people now concluded,
*  though with low confidence, that the pandemic most likely began from a lab leak. The journal's
*  reporters had this from a classified intelligence report unavailable for scrutiny by the public,
*  but delivered to the White House and key members of Congress who were unidentified.
*  The next day CNN's website posted a follow-up story stating that three sources, also unidentified,
*  had told CNN that the DOE-based its shift partly on information about research done at the Wuhan
*  Center for Disease Control and Prevention, another disease-related facility in the city,
*  more than seven miles from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This caught my attention,
*  because I knew that the Wuhan CDC, having recently relocated, was now just a few hundred yards
*  from the Huanan market. It occurred to me, disquietingly, that a virus leak from the center
*  might fit the spatial clustering of early cases around the market, as analyzed by Waribianist
*  colleagues in a way that a punitive leak from the WIV did not. But nothing more on that provocative
*  assertion has come from CNN, or from any other news outlet in the month since. I was reminded that
*  the Wuhan CDC moved to its new location near the market only on December 2, 2019. That date,
*  plus the time presumably needed to bring laboratory work back online, might not jive with a viral
*  outbreak that most likely began in late November. In any case, two different sources with good
*  access to the Chinese research community told me that the Wuhan CDC, as distinct from the national
*  CDC in Beijing, had no coronavirus research program before the pandemic. One of those sources,
*  Jane Chu, a China-born independent journalist, added that the Wuhan Group's mandate was mainly
*  technical tasks such as disease surveillance, rather than research. Chu couldn't name her own sources
*  due to their potential jeopardy in China. Still more recently, in mid-June, came the
*  sub-stack article I alluded to earlier, claiming that Ben Hu and two others from Shangri-Li Xi's lab
*  were the first people infected by the virus, and therefore the starting point of the pandemic.
*  Posted by Michael Schellenberger and two co-authors, this article cited unidentified sources within
*  the U.S. government, who was the first author on a 2017 paper describing the Xi Group's discovery
*  of multiple coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 in bats from a cave, not the Mojyang mine, in southern China,
*  and experimental work on three of those viruses that some critics considered risky.
*  Who, when the other two scientists, according to Schellenberger and his co-authors,
*  had contracted COVID-19-like illnesses in November 2019, suggesting that they were the conduits
*  of a lab leak. Who, himself, promptly denied the allegation in an email to John Cohen at science.
*  I did not get sick in autumn 2019, and did not have COVID-19-like symptoms at that time.
*  Furthermore, who told Cohen, he and both colleagues had tested negative for signs of recent COVID
*  infection, antibodies, in March 2020.
*  The search of opinion toward the lab leak idea was interrupted in March, when Florence Daybar,
*  a scientist working for France's National Center for Scientific Research, discovered another
*  body of interesting evidence, long missing, but now found. This was genomic data, from the swab
*  sampling of door surfaces and equipment and other items, including that pair of discarded gloves,
*  gathered at the Huanan market in early 2020, but withheld since that time.
*  The data were released, perhaps by mistake, and Daybar was alert enough to spot them and
*  recognize what they were. A team of researchers, including Wariby, detected a pattern in the data.
*  Strong proximity between samples containing raccoon dog DNA and others containing SARS-CoV-2 fragments,
*  and some samples that contained both, from stalls in the southwest corner of the market,
*  were wild animals had been sold as food. Malay and Porcupine DNA and a more hedgehog DNA
*  were also found near the virus, but raccoon dogs were of special interest because of their proven
*  susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. These findings didn't establish that raccoon dogs had carried the virus
*  into the market, but they added plausibility and detail to that scenario.
*  Notwithstanding the Daybar Group's revelations, the lab leak idea has remained strongly
*  preferred by public opinion, and not just in the United States. According to one poll as of April
*  2023, 62% of Italian respondents, 56% in France, and 50% in the United Kingdom, found the
*  lab leak idea most compelling, with sizable segments of undecided and flummoxed people
*  leaving only modest minorities embracing natural spillover. Earlier polling showed lab-related
*  scenarios even more strongly favored in still other countries, ranging from 73% in Kenya and 64%
*  in Hungary to 58% in Brazil. Various factors may account for this public drift to the lab leak
*  hypothesis. In my view, a preponderance of empirical evidence is not one of them. I agree it's
*  important to remain open-minded toward a lab leak possibility, but most of the arguments made in
*  support of that possibility boil down to conjecture from circumstance and unsupported accusations.
*  To speak of a lab leak hypothesis in the singular is, of course, misleading. There are multiple
*  lab leak hypotheses, just as there are multiple ways a natural spillover could have occurred.
*  A more encompassing and emolient phrase is research-related incident, referred by Jamie Metzel and
*  some other critics. That covers several possibilities, including the chance that Ms. Begotten gain
*  of function research at the WIV, or the Wuhan CDC, or who knows where, yielded a dangerous new
*  hybrid virus that escaped through a malfunctioning autoclave or an infected technician or grad student.
*  In support of this scenario, proponents point to a grant proposal known as Diffuse,
*  made by EcoHealth Alliance to a US Defense Research Agency in 2018, though never funded,
*  for experiments that some critics can strew as potentially dangerous gain of function research.
*  Another research-related possibility, the nightmare that some Chinese by a warfare program
*  created a murderous virus intentionally, but let it escape to the world by some catastrophic goof.
*  Still another, the notion that a scientific field worker became infected while taking samples from
*  bats in, say, the Mojang Mine, where Shang Li's team found RATG-13.
*  They're all vivid, but not all logical, and it seems to me they don't reinforce one another.
*  If a wild coronavirus from the Mojang Mine was capable of infecting and transmitting among humans,
*  for instance, then it didn't need a furan cleavage site to be inserted during reckless
*  or malevolent lab work. And if it infected a scientific field worker in 2013, and that field worker
*  returned to Wuhan, where did the virus linger for six years before exploding through the city's
*  population in 2019? And if the virus was engineered in Xi's lab using sophisticated gene editing
*  methods, or was transformed into this dangerous pathogen by passaging a less dangerous virus through
*  cell cultures or living mice, which seems far-fetched. And then subsequently escaped, then the Mojang
*  Mine, with all its sinister narrative appeal, is irrelevant. In other words, the various research-related
*  incident hypotheses may each be plausible, some more than others, but they compete against one another.
*  You can't pile them all on the scale and judge the likelihood of an unnatural origin by their combined weight.
*  Lab leak partisans have focused intently on Xi and her lab, but it's important to bear in mind
*  that Xi has made her career by publishing research and issuing warnings about potentially
*  dangerous coronavirus is found in the wild, not by keeping them secret. If she had such a formidable
*  dangerous virus in her lab in 2018 or 2019, a virus similar to the original SARS virus, but with a
*  receptor binding domain and a furan cleavage site well-shaped for human infection, features that
*  could make it even more dangerous, she presumably would have announced that important discovery from
*  the pages of a leading journal, to a professional gain as well as the benefit of the world.
*  She didn't. And there's a small body of lost evidence recently recovered that seems to support
*  this logic. In 2018, a scientist named Jia Chou led a study of SARS-related coronaviruses in
*  bats. His purpose was to illuminate the evolution of the original SARS virus by placing it on a
*  family tree of its relatives. Chou had been a postdoctoral fellow in Eddie Holmes's lab,
*  going from there to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for a couple of years, then to a position in
*  Shanghai. Chou and a group of colleagues, including both Holmes and Shang Li Xi, analyzed partial
*  genome sequences of 60 coronaviruses detected in bats samples collected from 2011 to 2016.
*  They wrote a paper and submitted it to a leading Virology journal. It was rejected. They tried
*  another. Rejected. The journal's reviewers wanted complete genome sequences, but the team had only
*  partials. So in October 2018, they gave up on that paper. They pulled it from the submission process.
*  They forgot about it. In the meantime, they had submitted their partial but telling genome data
*  to an international database, GenBank, with a routine stipulation that it would be embargoed
*  in this case for four years. The embargo allowed them to retain exclusive access to the data for
*  that period in the event they wanted to revive the project. Four years passed, and then in
*  October 2022, the embargo expired. The data, moth bolts since just before the pandemic and now
*  publicly available, were revealing for what they did not include, a progenitor of the pandemic virus.
*  Here were 60 coronaviruses that Cheng Li Xi and others had considered intriguing in 2018.
*  But nothing that matched SARS-CoV-2. Where's the virus, said Eddie Holmes, recounting this to me
*  recently? The virus is absolutely not there. Two other arguments on the lab leak side deserve
*  attention. Each can be phrased as a question. Why did SARS-CoV-2 from the start seem to be very
*  well adapted to humans? And why, if its natural host was some kind of bat, has that host not yet
*  been found after three and a half years? The first of those questions ignores the fact that SARS-CoV-2
*  has shown itself from the beginning to be quite capable of infecting other mammals, cats and dogs,
*  and eventually a wide range of them, tigers, gorillas, mink, white-tailed deer, and others,
*  not just humans. The second question betrays a lack of familiarity with the history of emerging viruses.
*  When a novel virus appears suddenly in humans, causing disease and alarm, the search for its natural
*  host is always an urgent task. But such ecological work is difficult to do amid the public health
*  emergency of an outbreak, and once the outbreak, or epidemic, or pandemic, is controlled, the sense of
*  urgency and the available research money tend to disappear. Finding the host animal is sometimes easy
*  by luck and sometimes hard, identifying horseshoe bats with high confidence as the likely host of
*  the original SARS virus took 15 years. Tracing the Marburg virus to its reservoir host in
*  Egyptian fruit bats took 41 years, or 42 if you count the time to publication. And the natural
*  host of Ebola virus, despite what you may think you've heard, is still unidentified, 47 years after
*  its emergence at a remote mission hospital and what was then Zaire. The suggested linkage between
*  a Ebola virus in some form of bat is still suppositional, not settled scientific fact, and we have
*  enough suppositions entangled with this subject already. So what's tilting the scales of popular
*  opinion toward lab leak? The answer to that is not embedded deeply in the arcane data I've been
*  skimming through here. What's tilting the scales it seems to me is cynicism and narrative appeal.
*  I asked about this in conversation with David Rehman, the biosecurity expert who is also an
*  author of the Investigate Letter with Jesse Bloom. To some extent Rehman agreed, when you saw the
*  seeds of distrust or suggest that you haven't been transparent with what you knew he told me,
*  you're setting yourself up for a persistent, insidious, continuing distrust. That inclines people
*  to assume that there was something deliberate or deliberately concealed. The seeds of distrust
*  have been growing in America's civic garden and the world's for a long time. More than 60% of Americans
*  according to polling within the past several years still declined to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald
*  acting alone killed John F. Kennedy. Is that because people have read the Warren Commission report,
*  found it unpersuasive and minutely scrutinized the magic bullet theory? No, it's because they've
*  learned to be distrustful, and because a conspiracy theory of any big event is more dramatic and satisfying
*  than a small stupid explanation. Like the notion that a feckless loser could kill a president by
*  hitting two out of three shots with a $13 rifle. Most of us don't reach our opinions by
*  festitious calibration of empirical evidence. We default to our priors as Jesse Bloom noted,
*  or we embrace stories that have simple plots, good and bad characters, and melodramatic trajectories,
*  and that seem commensurate in scope to the event in question. The process of scientific discovery
*  is a complicated story involving data collection, hypothesis testing, hypothesis falsification,
*  hypothesis revision, further testing, and brilliant but fallible humans doing all that work.
*  Scientific malfeasance driven by hubris and leading to runaway trouble on the other hand
*  is a much simpler story that goes back at least to Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein.
*  Karl Bergstrom is an evolutionary biologist and an author of commentaries on scientific misinformation.
*  He ponders among other things how students of science are taught, or at least should be taught,
*  about not just what science says but what science is. I asked Bergstrom about the human
*  affinity for dark theories of big events. There was something about that in Thomas Hardy, he told me.
*  It's in Tess of the Derbivance, where Tess is doomed by hapless chance. It really sucks to live in a
*  world where we are at the mercy of hapless chance. I had never read Tess of the Derbivance to my
*  embarrassment, so I stuck with SARS-CoV-2. This is not a contest now in the public domain between
*  bodies of evidence, I propose. This is a contest between stories. Yeah, Bergstrom said. That's right.
