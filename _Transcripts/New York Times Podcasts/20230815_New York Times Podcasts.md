# A Law Used Against the Mafia â€” and Now Trump
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfsIk0cd_X8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael O'Borrow.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today a Fulton County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment, charging 19 individuals
*  with violations of Georgia law arising from a criminal conspiracy to overturn the results
*  of the 2020 presidential election in this state.
*  On Monday night, Donald Trump was indicted for a fourth time since leaving office, this
*  time by a local prosecutor for his attempt, along with 18 alleged co-conspirators, to
*  overturn the 2020 election results in the state of Georgia.
*  Specifically, the indictment brings felony charges against Donald John Trump, Rudolph
*  William Lewis Giuliani, John Charles Eastman.
*  I spoke with my colleague Richard Fausette about why of all the charges now piling up
*  against Trump, this one may be the hardest for him to ever escape.
*  It's Tuesday, August 15th.
*  So Richard, it's almost 1am on Tuesday morning because grand juries don't care about newspaper
*  deadlines or journalists' sleep schedule.
*  So I'll spare you any small talk and just jump right in.
*  I want you to give us an overview of this fourth indictment against Donald Trump, which
*  we got just about two hours ago.
*  Sure.
*  This is a state of Georgia indictment that charges former President Trump and 18 of his
*  associates and allies of a really broad range of crimes, all of them in an effort to overturn
*  the election in Georgia.
*  And in a lot of ways, Michael, it is exactly what the prosecutor here in Fulton County,
*  Willis sort of insinuated, if not promised, which is that she is very fond of the Rico
*  statute, the racketeering statute in Georgia that allows prosecutors to tie together all
*  kinds of different crimes and actions in one big package and show that there's an organization
*  that exists to carry out a corrupt scheme.
*  And that's in fact, exactly what she did here.
*  There's a really interesting passage in the very front of the indictment that explains
*  what this corrupt scheme was.
*  And if you'll give me one moment, I'll find it for you.
*  The introduction states, defendant Donald Trump lost the United States presidential
*  election held on November 3rd, 2020.
*  One of the states he lost was Georgia.
*  Trump and the other defendants charged in this indictment refused to accept that Trump
*  And they knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome
*  of the election in favor of Trump.
*  That conspiracy contained a common plan and purpose to commit two or more acts of racketeering
*  activity in Fulton County, Georgia, elsewhere in the state of Georgia and in other states.
*  So right there, you have in very plain language, a real narrative.
*  It's the story, according to these prosecutors of a group of people who got together at
*  a set period of time and committed a number of acts in furtherance of a corrupt aim, which
*  was to overturn the very narrow election loss of Donald J. Trump in Georgia in November
*  2020.
*  Right.
*  You had warned us that this would be the district attorney's approach in this case where we
*  talked to you about this investigation many, many months ago.
*  Just explain racketeering, Rico, as a legal concept, how it applies here and why it seems
*  so central to this indictment.
*  Well, very often the way we see racketeering used by prosecutors, it's a way to tie a bunch
*  of people working together toward a common nefarious goal and hold them all accountable
*  up and down the chain of command.
*  We saw this in the context of the mafia, where you would see people getting arrested for
*  extortion.
*  But then once they were arrested, perhaps convicted, some other low level foot soldier
*  would come along and commit an act of extortion.
*  The shot callers remained somewhat immune.
*  In the case of Rico, you can show a jury a pattern of illegal activity committed very
*  often by a group of people.
*  And you're able to start holding people accountable who may not have their fingerprints on the
*  messiest pieces.
*  And that's exactly what we saw here.
*  That's exactly what's alleged here, that there were people on the ground who were committing
*  acts in furtherance of this conspiracy in Georgia.
*  But then there were much higher placed people who are alleged to have been also involved
*  in planning these crimes and directing these crimes.
*  So you see these 19 people indicted.
*  And the first person named in the indictment is Donald John Trump.
*  Right below him is Rudy Giuliani.
*  And you have a number of high powered lawyers connected to the president.
*  And then you get down the list to some very obscure people.
*  Like who?
*  Well, one that really stands out is a woman named Trevion Cutie, who has called herself
*  a publicist for the rapper Kanye West.
*  She's a not very well known person.
*  She's somebody who is alleged to have traveled to Georgia with the purpose of intimidating
*  a Fulton County, Georgia elections worker right before the certification of the votes
*  in Washington to try to pressure her to admit that she had committed election fraud, which
*  was all just a total canard.
*  But you see the range you see us go from Trevion Cutie kind of at the bottom to Donald Trump
*  about as high toward the top as you can get.
*  So as with the mafia, the idea is to get the foot soldiers, the political operative on
*  the ground, somebody many of us have never heard of, and work its way all the way up
*  to top lawyers and the former president himself.
*  Exactly. And even though everyone in this indictment is charged with more than one count
*  of violating more than one Georgia criminal statute, they're all charged with RICO.
*  They're all charged with racketeering.
*  It's a very serious crime in Georgia.
*  It carries potentially five to 20 years in prison or a fine.
*  And it's the kind of penalty that can force people to consider flipping and cooperating
*  with prosecutors.
*  This may be the very beginning of a very drawn out drama in which you see some of the people
*  further down the food chain buckling to the pressure and helping prosecutors get the
*  people of the food chain that they probably want more.
*  I want to pause on that.
*  Should we understand this indictment in its enormous scale, 19 defendants, as being an
*  effort to get perhaps the lowest level people in that list of 19 to cooperate with the
*  DA to testify against your Rudy Giuliani's and your Donald Trump's?
*  Is that what this may ultimately be about?
*  I think prosecutors always want in a conspiracy style charge like this to see if they can
*  pressure the small fish to get the big fish.
*  We don't know if it's going to happen, but it's something that you definitely see in a
*  big kind of gnarly case like this.
*  Got it. So the racketeering framework of this case is clearly what differentiates it from
*  the last big indictment that we all just witnessed against Trump, which was the federal
*  indictment by special counsel Jack Smith of Trump over his efforts to subvert the 2020
*  election, which feels otherwise kind of similar, except it was about just one person,
*  Donald Trump. This is much, much bigger and it casts a much, much wider net.
*  Is that right?
*  That's absolutely right.
*  And I think it's really worth thinking about the comparison between the latest Jack Smith
*  case that charges Donald Trump with election interference and the Fulton County case,
*  which does the same under state law.
*  You have the Jack Smith case, this federal case, which charges just one guy, Donald
*  John Trump. It appears to be built to be a case that will be very narrow and very fast.
*  One guy try to slam it into the courts as soon as you can.
*  Don't lard it up with other co-conspirators, although maybe down the line we'll see that.
*  But right now it looks like Jack Smith wants to just go bang, bang, bang and make this
*  thing go as fast as he can.
*  I think for Fonny Willis, and I think we discussed this before, how she likes Rico
*  because it allows jurors to see the whole picture and the whole story.
*  It allows prosecutors to introduce a lot more evidence than in other kinds of trials.
*  And you get this big sprawling story that they can chew on.
*  But there is a potential downside here.
*  By going so wide and including so many defendants, you could really see this case
*  slow down as it moves through the courts.
*  You could also see a lot of confusion in a jury because you have so many different
*  elements of this scheme laid out.
*  It's not a simple story at this point.
*  It's a very complex story.
*  So what specific evidence does the district attorney lay out in the indictment to
*  support this sweeping claim of racketeering?
*  Well, it's a really remarkable cache of evidence, and it includes everything from
*  tweets from Donald Trump to evidence of false statements made before legislative
*  bodies, which can be a crime in Georgia.
*  It's a lot of different actions, but you can really see how many different ways
*  the Trump team was trying to make something happen here in Georgia when the
*  numbers didn't add up for their candidate.
*  You had President Trump making phone calls, pressuring phone calls to Brad
*  Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of State.
*  Famously.
*  Famously, you have, of course, the scheme to seat 16 pro-Trump Republican
*  electors who would vote for Donald Trump and deliver the 16 electoral votes from
*  Georgia to Donald Trump, even though Donald Trump lost.
*  It's a remarkable story.
*  And you have some really interesting charges related to those efforts.
*  And then you have this really bizarre chapter, which largely went down the day
*  after January 6th, whereby a group of data experts hired by the conspiracy
*  theorist and Trump-aligned lawyer, Sidney Powell, and some other pro-Trump people
*  visited this rural county 200 miles from Atlanta called Coffee County.
*  And they copied all of the very sensitive elections data down there.
*  Wait, they just walked into an election office and somehow got a hold of all
*  the internal election data?
*  Yes, it was a very pro-Trump county.
*  And some election officials in that county let them kind of come in and do
*  what they did.
*  The woman who was the director of elections in the county at the time, who
*  was charged in this document, had been saying online that somehow the machines
*  didn't work and was kind of raising the possibility that bad things were
*  happening there in Joe Biden's favor.
*  None of it turned out to be true, but this team came down and copied all this
*  data. And it's a pretty serious and sensitive breach.
*  And of course, the indictment alleges it constituted a violation of Georgia
*  laws as well.
*  Richard, based on how you described racketeering, the elements of that
*  evidence that seemed to fit that description is that this was activity
*  that involved the guy at the top, Donald Trump, but a tremendous amount of it.
*  In fact, the majority of it was being conducted by people under the former
*  president, by lower level people, including folks walking into an election
*  office in rural Georgia, trying to steal election data.
*  That's what makes this in the eyes of the district attorney, Fonny Willis,
*  racketeering.
*  Yes, that all these people were committing acts and furtherance of a big
*  conspiracy. And they may not have all known one another.
*  In fact, they didn't all know one another.
*  Donald Trump probably didn't know a number of them by name.
*  But in a Rico case, in many cases, it doesn't matter.
*  They were all working together at a certain period of time and essentially
*  formed a kind of an organization.
*  And they had this kind of corrupt endgame.
*  And as a result, everybody gets wrapped up in this one big Rico charge.
*  Right. Because what they share is a common mission.
*  That common mission is to overturn the election and that, according to this
*  indictment, was illegal. That makes them all basically part of the same
*  organized criminal unit.
*  Exactly.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Richard, you've been reporting on this investigation.
*  For months.
*  So now that the indictment is actually out, I'm curious, based on your reporting
*  and all the conversations you've had with legal experts, whether this case is seen
*  as strong, especially given the racketeering framework, or if it's seen as
*  risky, given its ambition and breadth, and how experts think about its strengths
*  and weaknesses relative to all the previous indictments against Trump.
*  Well, the district attorney has tremendous experience with the Rico statute.
*  She hired the leading Rico expert in Georgia to help her with this case.
*  They collaborated on previous Rico cases, some very high profile ones.
*  There's one specific case with some public school teachers who have been cheating
*  on standardized tests that was very successful, although very controversial.
*  She knows how to use this statute and it's going to be very helpful to her and
*  her team as they go into trial.
*  But the reality is, I know we don't like to use the word unprecedented at the
*  New York Times, but I mean, just really go back and try to find the precedent for
*  a local prosecutor who has brought state charges against a former president with,
*  you know, a case that reaches into the justice department, into the campaign of
*  the presidential candidate, and then far beyond onto these very sort of strange
*  tentacles of an alleged scheme.
*  Right.
*  It's kind of a classic legal David versus Goliath.
*  I mean, this isn't virtually until now, unknown local prosecutor taking on
*  the president of the United States.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, critics of our justice system will say, wait a minute, you know, the
*  prosecutors like Fonny Willis have tremendous power, perhaps inordinate power,
*  if you listen to them.
*  So it sets up a really fascinating fight and it's just really hard to go back in
*  history and look for anything like it.
*  So I hesitate to say it's going to be a slam dunk or it is a strong case.
*  It's a weak case.
*  I think we're all kind of sailing out into waters that we've just never been in
*  before.
*  And another thing to keep in mind about this case is that a president can't use
*  his pardon power to wiggle out of a state conviction in Georgia.
*  So in some ways, you know, I think sometimes we fall in the trap of thinking,
*  you know, a federal charge is really super important.
*  A state charge is just a little bit lower because the federal government's bigger
*  than a state government or whatever.
*  Right.
*  This is an interesting case where it's a really serious problem for the president.
*  If he gets reelected, he might have the ability to pardon himself if he's convicted
*  in federal court.
*  But in Georgia, he just can't go there.
*  So this could pose a very serious threat to him and his freedom.
*  Right.
*  Because presidents cannot pardon themselves for state level crimes, whereas in theory
*  they can pardon themselves for federal crimes.
*  And I guess by the same token, when it comes to a federal prosecution, a president can
*  take over the Department of Justice and just get rid of it.
*  You're saying, I'm guessing that that's not possible with a local case because the
*  president has no power over a local district attorney.
*  Yeah, it's a really interesting expression of the way our federal system works, that
*  the states run their own justice systems and it just really limits the powers of what
*  even the president can do.
*  Right.
*  So if every other case falls away, this case would very likely remain no matter how
*  long it takes.
*  And as you said earlier, Richard, given how big a case it is, given how many
*  defendants there are, how many delay tactics they all might deploy, it could take a
*  very long time for this to ever reach the trial phase.
*  But once it does, there's really nothing that former President Trump or future
*  President Trump can do about it.
*  I think the limitations of the president's power when it comes to this case has got
*  to be a problem that's looming just like a tremendous dark shadow over President
*  Trump's consciousness when he contemplates this case in Georgia.
*  Richard, what happens next in this case?
*  19 defendants, do all of them now turn themselves in?
*  Do all of them show up in court together?
*  Are all of them going to be on trial together?
*  That is going to be a very, very crowded courtroom if it is.
*  Well, we're going to see a lot of people roll into Atlanta.
*  We think that a number of them will be booked at the county jail, which is known in
*  and around Atlanta and in a lot of hip hop lyrics because we're in the hip hop
*  capital of the world, ostensibly as Rice Street.
*  So a lot of people are going to go to Rice Street to get booked.
*  It is far from Mar-a-Lago in many ways.
*  They're going to be fingerprinted.
*  They're going to have their mug shots taken.
*  The Secret Service may intervene and change the way some of this works for
*  President Trump, but the sheriff here has said he expects the president to have his
*  mug shot taken.
*  We expect him to come to court and plead not guilty.
*  And then after that, before trial, we expect a lot of efforts by President Trump's
*  attorneys and perhaps other attorneys to try to derail this case and prevent it
*  from going to court at all.
*  So, and this is before we get to a drama like a multi-week, multi-month jury
*  selection and then a trial.
*  So we're really in for the long haul here potentially.
*  But what Fonny Willis said in her news conference tonight is that she wants to
*  try all 19 of these defendants together and that her plan is to ask that a
*  trial starts within six months.
*  And if Fonny Willis gets that timetable, then her trial will be competing with,
*  perhaps occurring in parallel with three other criminal trials involving the
*  former president.
*  Yeah, it's a huge complicated pile up of legal cases.
*  It's going to be of great interest to us to see how the court systems lay out
*  these various trials.
*  But what we do know is Donald Trump is going to be spending a lot of time in
*  court in the coming months.
*  Over, Richard.
*  Thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thanks, Mike.
*  In a statement on Monday night, Donald Trump's presidential campaign accused
*  district attorney Fonny Willis of being, quote, a rabid partisan who chose to
*  charge Trump in the middle of his presidential campaign in order to keep him
*  from winning back the White House.
*  A few hours later, during a news conference, Willis countered that claim,
*  saying, quote, I make decisions in this office based on the facts and the laws,
*  adding that, quote, the law is completely nonpartisan.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In a landmark ruling on Monday, a state court in Montana ruled in favor of 16
*  young people who had sued the state for supporting the fossil fuel industry.
*  The plaintiffs, ranging in age from 5 to 22, argued that Montana's permissive
*  approach to fossil fuels had violated their rights because the state's
*  constitution guarantees a, quote, clean and healthful environment.
*  The judge agreed, striking down a state law passed earlier this year by
*  Montana's Republican controlled legislature that prevented the state from
*  considering the climate impact of new oil, coal, and gas projects.
*  The ruling is a major victory for climate activists who have filed similar
*  lawsuits in several states and against the federal government.
