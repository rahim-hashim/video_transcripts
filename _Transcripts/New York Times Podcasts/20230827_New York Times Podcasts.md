# The Sunday Read: ‘The Fight for the Right to Trespass’
**NewYorkTimesPodcasts:** [August 27, 2023](https://rr3---sn-ab5l6nrs.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1711031007&ei=f-77ZZPIGZep_9EP3NW76A8&ip=2603%3A7000%3A3200%3Ade9e%3A68a7%3Ae516%3Aff66%3A8d9d&id=o-AFR2DmL2WF4sPWdatdI_TiXvOY83v7hX_oYcjFOqlPLX&itag=139&source=youtube&requiressl=yes&xpc=EgVo2aDSNQ%3D%3D&mh=ok&mm=31%2C29&mn=sn-ab5l6nrs%2Csn-ab5sznzr&ms=au%2Crdu&mv=m&mvi=3&pl=37&initcwndbps=1367500&vprv=1&mime=audio%2Fmp4&gir=yes&clen=15984397&dur=2621.063&lmt=1693132880207068&mt=1711009013&fvip=3&keepalive=yes&c=ANDROID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER&txp=6218224&sparams=expire%2Cei%2Cip%2Cid%2Citag%2Csource%2Crequiressl%2Cxpc%2Cvprv%2Cmime%2Cgir%2Cclen%2Cdur%2Clmt&sig=AJfQdSswRQIhAMh4BDr7sy_tRRXetsvLdkQdV6eAWggIgP_IahXXtBHjAiAYpfR1JaYqc-UOxQAxXZ2zYlxy7i3_k7r3huWfqZPFsA%3D%3D&lsparams=mh%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cmvi%2Cpl%2Cinitcwndbps&lsig=ALClDIEwRQIgES2QtA1oIM1UvrJuwjuWm26gseAF1hLC-gO68HOgPu8CIQC75yP6DNHCJKYHHGAnF144AyeZSvMiHyxGTuTvAFIVzw%3D%3D)
*  As Americans, I think we're used to the idea that land can be owned.
*  Whether it's a beachfront or, say, a streambed, and if you own the land, you can just, for
*  example, build on it, or sell its water rights, or you can keep other people from ever
*  accessing it.
*  We just accept it as the way that things naturally work.
*  Like a lot of our laws, we inherited this way of looking at land ownership from England.
*  When I went there, I found that a growing group of people are thinking about ownership
*  of land and access to land, very differently than Americans are.
*  And they're thinking that, well, property might belong to somebody.
*  It doesn't mean other people shouldn't be able to walk on it or picnic or camp on it.
*  It's a vision of land and the outdoors that's so radically different from ours, that I had
*  to go see it for myself.
*  My name is Brooke Jarvis, and I'm a contributing writer to the New York Times magazine.
*  This week's Sunday read is about a group of English activists who are pushing for more
*  rights to explore England's natural spaces.
*  One way these activists do this is through mass trespasses, which are actually a kind of
*  protest that dates back more than a century.
*  They're pushing for something that a lot of other European countries already have, a
*  right to roam.
*  I went to England this past spring, where I joined two of these events.
*  One was at the Kinder Reservoir in the Peac District near Manchester.
*  The lies underneath a tall plateau of Moreland called Kinderskout, which is where one of
*  the most famous trespasses of the 1930s happened.
*  The activist planned to take a dip in the water as a form of protest to show that people
*  needed more access to open water swimming.
*  I went to another trespass that was led by someone in a local folk choir in Brits.
*  We headed out to this very old castle that has been in the same family since shortly
*  after the Norman Conquest and walked around the fields and grounds.
*  We stopped in the little patch of woodlands along the way and sang songs together.
*  The
*  river is a radio.
*  The sun is a coming rain.
*  The sun is a coming rain.
*  The sun is a radio.
*  Many of the activists I wrote about treased the start of their involvement to the pandemic.
*  They had a real hunger to be outside, but they kept finding out that they had a lot less
*  access to the land around them than they'd realized.
*  People told me they felt trapped, walled off from the natural world.
*  There was all this space around them that they couldn't get into.
*  And they began rethinking what was possible.
*  So here's my article, The Fight for the Right to Tress Pass, read by Gabbara Zachman.
*  The signs on the gate at the entrance to the path and along the edge of the reservoir
*  were clear.
*  No swimming they warned, white letters on a red background.
*  On a chill mid-April day in northwest England, with low grey clouds and rain in the forecast,
*  the signs hardly seemed necessary.
*  But then people began arriving by the dozens and then the hundreds.
*  Some walked only from nearby hayfield while others came by train or bus or foot from
*  many hours away.
*  In a long trailing line, they tramped up the hill beside the dam and around the shore
*  of the reservoir, slipping in mud and jumping over puddles.
*  Above them rose a long, curving hill of open moreland.
*  Its Heather still winter brown.
*  When they came to a gap between a stone wall and a metal fence, they squeezed through it,
*  one by one, slipping under strings of barbed wire toward the water below.
*  On the steep grassy bank above the reservoir, coats and sweaters came off, revealing
*  wet suits and swimsuits.
*  Their misses of tea and hot chocolate were ready for quick access.
*  Someone had brought along a banged-up trumpet with which to provide the appropriate fanfare.
*  There were seasoned winter swimmers, people who had stories of breaking through ice for
*  a dip, and complete newbies, deciding as they shivered whether this particular symbolic
*  act was really for them.
*  There was a seven-year-old who swam in a knit beanie with a purple pom-pom, and a man
*  with a Yorkshire accent who told his wife, in mock horror, I had to ask a strange woman
*  to zip me up, Mary.
*  Down on the shore, giggling and shrieking people picked their way across slippery rocks.
*  Then, with a great deal of cheering and splashing, they took to the water on mass, bending out
*  in all directions.
*  Someone carried a large banner that read, The Right to Swim.
*  The water was somewhere around 50 degrees Fahrenheit, but it felt a 61-year-old swimmer announced
*  after climbing out and wrapping up again, bloody wonderful.
*  She handed her sister a cheddar and branched in pickle sandwich and told me she usually
*  hates encountering crowds when they go swimming, but that this one was delightful.
*  More rounds of cheers went up as new waves of swimmers splashed into the water, and
*  older women wearing a pink floral swimsuit paused on the shore to turn to the crowd still
*  on land.
*  Don't be beaten down, she shouted, raising a fist above her flower-bedecked bathing
*  cap.
*  Rebell!
*  Then she too, flopped into the lake.
*  On the bank above the reservoir, a choir serenaded the swimmers.
*  He said, all this land is my masters.
*  At that I stood shaking my head.
*  No man has the right to own mountains, any more than the deep ocean bed.
*  The song by the folks singer you and McCall was about another mass trespass, one that took
*  place 91 years earlier above this very reservoir, during which protesters were arrested for daring
*  to walk on hills they were told to keep off.
*  After the decades that followed, the protesters' contention that people had some inherent
*  rights of access even to lands they did not own, which in England is most land, because
*  the vast majority of the country is in private hands, was enshrined in law, guaranteeing public
*  access to this and many other parts of the countryside.
*  Lately though, the swimmers told me, those hard-won gains had begun to seem both less
*  expansive and less secure than they once imagined.
*  During the pandemic, many took up open water swimming or paddling or walking only to be
*  surprised at the number of places they weren't allowed to go.
*  The reservoir owned by a private utility company even though it is inside the Peak District
*  National Park was one such place.
*  England's national parks are full of land that is privately owned and inhabited, farmed,
*  mined and hunted.
*  The government began to push to criminalize forms of trespass never before considered to
*  be crimes.
*  In January, the High Court sided with a wealthy couple who wanted to keep the public from
*  camping on an estate they bought inside Dartmore National Park in an area called the Cummins.
*  The only place in England where wild camping, what we would call backpacking, was still
*  considered a right.
*  Robert McFarland, the English nature writer, called the ruling a nationwide wake-up call.
*  Only when the last relic of a long lost openness was threatened, did it become clear just
*  how much was at stake.
*  Like the trespassers whose anniversary they were commemorating, the swimmers believed they
*  were fighting for something bigger than the chance to walk up a hill or swim in a river,
*  something fundamental about their relationship to the land where they lived.
*  It's not so much that we need to be granted permission, explained a woman with long gray
*  hair and a sweatshirt that read kayaking is not a crime.
*  It's that we need it to be recognized that we don't need permission.
*  Centuries ago, high moors like those of Kinder Scout, the plateau that stretched above
*  the reservoir, were considered King's Land, uncultivated areas to which access was free.
*  In the villages below, land was often claimed by the aristocracy and gentry who collected
*  taxes from the peasants who worked it.
*  But many villagers, called commoners, held shared rights to common land where they could
*  graze their animals or plant crops or gather firewood.
*  This type of land disappeared rapidly during the enclosure movement of the 18th and 19th
*  centuries, when the wealthy claimed wild and common lands.
*  Lands that as the jurist William Blackstone put it previously belonged generally to everybody
*  but particularly to nobody as their own.
*  The movement leaned on the work of philosophers such as John Locke, who argued that people
*  could gain ownership of waste lands by working and improving them.
*  But there were others who believed that separating people from the land was a gross injustice.
*  What crimes, wars, murders, what miseries and horrors would the human race have been
*  spared, wrote Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
*  By someone who, pulling up the stakes or filling in the ditch, had cried out to his fellow
*  humans, beware of listening to this imposter.
*  You are lost if you forget that the fruits are everyone's, and the earth's is no one's.
*  As enclosure spread, many former users of the land were pushed out.
*  With no way to make a living, they drifted to cities.
*  Thunder is not far from Manchester and Sheffield, two early centers of the Industrial Revolution,
*  whose residents like to escape the choking air by going on long walks in the countryside.
*  But many of the landowners who controlled the hills weren't fond of having walkers, known
*  as ramblers, exploring properties they used for racing sheep and hunting grouse.
*  They hired armies of gamekeepers, who sometimes used attack dogs to kick the ramblers out.
*  Some ramblers in their city lives were involved in trade unions and other labor movements,
*  and they began to bring the same spirit of organization and protest to their weekend
*  walks.
*  As the most shoutable line of the Macal song has it, I may be a wage slave on Monday,
*  but I am a free man on Sunday.
*  The land they were walking might be private property they argued, but its owners weren't
*  the only ones with the right to use it.
*  The Walsh law acknowledges that a right can be established through long custom, and
*  the walkers were following ancient paths and bridal ways onto upland that had only recently
*  been privatized.
*  Some walkers began holding rallies and undertaking purposeful trespasses in places where they knew
*  they would be ejected.
*  This had been going on for decades, when, in April 1932, a rambler named Benny Rothman
*  alerted the press that he and others would be heading up past the reservoir to the plateau
*  above it, an area owned by the Duke of Devonshire.
*  Hundreds of ramblers tussled with keepers, making national headlines.
*  Six were arrested, and five sentenced to as much as six months in jail.
*  At the time, England was home to a number of groups working to protect commons, parks
*  and walking trails as part of what the campaigner Octavia Hill at an 1888 meeting of what eventually
*  became the Open Spaces Society, OSS, called a common possession we ought to try to hand
*  down undiminished in number and in beauty.
*  Most saw the trespassers' actions as counterproductive.
*  Eventually, however, the Kinder trespass became what the OSS now calls a sacred event in rambling
*  circles, and its leaders' beliefs were more widely embraced.
*  Beginning in the 1940s, Parliament began to codify the idea that people had an inherent
*  right to move across the landscape, culminating in the countryside rights of way Crow Act in
*  2000.
*  The Act recognized the right not only to use designated paths, but also to roam freely
*  on certain mountains, moors, heaths and downs mapped as open country, or on land registered
*  as common.
*  In 2009, the Marine and Coastal Access Act designated the shore as Access Land as well,
*  and promised an additional 2,700 miles of coastal footpaths.
*  Today, there are about 140,000 miles of legally protected paths in England, and the countryside
*  is full of signs marking public footpaths or rights of way.
*  I found them leading past fields of rapeseed or sheep, along a creek that flowed behind
*  the walls of private gardens through woods to a country pub.
*  The first time I encountered such a sign, it marked a charming little trail leading over
*  a brook at the end of the lane where I was staying in little hayfield.
*  I had other plans for the morning, and only meant to take a tiny walk, but suddenly I
*  couldn't help myself.
*  Having grown up in rural Tennessee, where the no-trash-passing signs were so ubiquitous
*  as to hardly be necessary, I was overcome by the mere fact of permission.
*  There was a path to who knew where, on which I was decidedly welcome.
*  Not just welcome, in fact, but entitled.
*  It would have felt almost disrespectful to ignore it.
*  To an American, traversing the land in rural England can feel a bit like looking in a fun
*  house mirror, a system just different enough that it forces you to see your own expectations
*  in a new way.
*  Some of the people I met in England had heard that the United States has a lot of public
*  land, which is true, but access to it depends a lot on where you live.
*  Nearly all federal land is in just 11 Western states and Alaska, and even there the courts
*  are still working out what public really means.
*  Mulling, for example, when anglers are allowed to walk on public stream beds that run through
*  private property, or whether hunters can cross private airspace by using a ladder to get
*  from one checkerboard square of public land to another.
*  Hunters had heard that the United States is a warrant of private lands governed by threatening
*  science and stanger ground laws.
*  The week of the swim trespass, the news back home was full of stories of people being
*  shot after accidentally driving up the wrong driveway or knocking on the wrong door.
*  Kate Rue, the founder of England's Outdoor Swimming Society, remembered with shock when she
*  arrived at the Pacific, eager to swim, but couldn't find a beach that wasn't private
*  property.
*  Other activists, Owen Heyman, told some friends he was visiting in Montana that he was headed
*  out for a walk, and was surprised when they replied that they would first need to drive
*  him somewhere.
*  A farmer I met in Gloucestershire, who thought the English already had plenty of access
*  to his land, nonetheless seemed to sympathize with my plight as an American.
*  You can't go anywhere, can you?
*  After following that first right of way sign, I stumbled on a spring full of plump tadpoles
*  and followed a red striped bumblebee from flower to flower.
*  I thought about how nice the word ramble was, how it evoked wandering and whimsy and openness
*  instead of the determined point-to-point rush of the American hike.
*  I navigated a brief standoff with a pair of rams, soaked my feet in a boggy cow pasture
*  and skirted private houses.
*  One resident nodded politely from behind a sign, please respect our privacy.
*  And I liked rather better than the sign one of my mother's neighbors in the United States
*  displays on her mailbox.
*  If you can read this, you're in range.
*  I emerged at the top of a hill called Lantern Pike, said to have gotten its name because
*  it once served as a place to like beacon fires.
*  In one direction, I could see the buildings of Manchester, and in the other, the long,
*  brown line of kinder scout, notched in the middle where a waterfall tumbles down.
*  Below it were fields of bright green pasture, squared in by dark stone walls.
*  A little over a decade ago, a young illustrator named Nick Hayes was staying with his parents
*  in West Berkshire, not far from London, while he worked on a graphic novel.
*  One day, walking near lightning struck Willow, he spotted a kingfisher, the first he ever saw.
*  He hoped to show it to his mother, but as they approached the tree, a man on a four-wheeler
*  raced over announcing, you've no right to be here.
*  You're trespassing.
*  The pair immediately turned around.
*  Hayes walked home, struck by the power of that single word.
*  He typed trespass into a search engine, surprised to learn that his actions were merely
*  a civil offense, typically punishable only in the case of property damage, and that trespass
*  hadn't always been considered an offense at all.
*  The more he read, the more Hayes began to believe that the building of a wall, not the climbing
*  of it, was the bigger crime.
*  He began working on a book about what he was learning, taking himself on small trespasses
*  around the country, climbing over the walls of large estates or slipping past them by kayak.
*  Sometimes there was shouting.
*  Sometimes threats.
*  Everywhere he found reminders of a long, ever-evolving relationship with the land.
*  It was in the land use, the box hunts and deer parks of the wealthy, and in the literature,
*  all that wide-open walking and Tolkien and Wordsworth, and in the language.
*  Beyond the pale originates from the middle English word for fence, and acre comes from the
*  old English for open field.
*  Though the word eventually stopped meaning unoccupied land and came to define standardized
*  measures by which land could be bought and sold.
*  You can chuck a stone in England, and there's a story of land dispossession wherever it
*  lands.
*  Hayes told me when I first spoke to him last year.
*  Fencing people off from nature, he believed, caused each to suffer.
*  People felt bereft and disconnected, and problems like pollution or biodiversity loss became
*  less visible, harder to care about.
*  Hayes became convinced that society put too much emphasis on the sacredness of private
*  property and the accompanying threat of trespass.
*  Kinder trespass was evidence of that.
*  To cheer a man for walking through Heather, and likewise to beat him up for it, are both
*  absurdly disproportionate to the act itself, he wrote.
*  But inside the logic of the bubble, such an act is tantamount to anarchy because it threatens
*  the spell.
*  In this context, even the Crow Act began to look less like a victory for the public and
*  more like a consolation prize that disguised how much had already been lost.
*  The right of way officially applies only to movement.
*  Pads are for walking and bridal ways for riding, not for camping or picnicking or drawing
*  or hula hooping.
*  Pads and access land are concentrated in the least populated rural regions and are scarce
*  where most people live.
*  Many protected areas are difficult to navigate.
*  People who spend time in the countryside rely on detailed maps from the government to figure
*  out where they are or aren't allowed to walk.
*  Echoing their military heritage, they're called OS, or Ordnance Survey Maps.
*  Some places offer no real access because they are islands floating in a sea of private
*  property.
*  You would need a helicopter or a parachute to get to them, while others require constant
*  vigilance to keep open.
*  In one famous case, a company associated with the Taikun Nicholas Van Hooogstratten, who
*  was known for his involvement in the killing of a business rival and once referred to
*  Ramblers as Scum of the Earth, erected buildings and fences that blocked a protected right of
*  way in East Sussex.
*  The path was closed for 13 years before Hooogstratten lost in court and Cade Ashbrook, a former
*  chairwoman of the Ramblers and now General Secretary of the OSS, reopened the path by
*  taking a pair of bolt cutters to a padlocked gate.
*  The Crow Act was also time-limited.
*  There is likely less than a decade left during which new access paths can be certified, but
*  the process for adding them is Byzantine.
*  To certify a right of way, you have to prove that you've never asked a landowner for
*  permission to walk there, which turns a right into a retractable handout, that you have
*  used it for at least 20 years, and accepted stand-in for proof that a right has been earned
*  by virtue of being exercised since time immemorial, a period which, because of quirks of English
*  law, officially ended with the death of Henry II in 1189, and that you and others have
*  used the path openly without your right to do so being challenged.
*  An access land cannot have been improved by agriculture, proof of which often requires
*  expensive certifications by botanists.
*  This can lead to absurdity, says Ashbrook, who likes to walk up the hill near her house
*  in the chilterns.
*  It looks the same all over, but because of what Ashbrook described as botanical issues
*  of great detail, only one side qualified as access land opened for rambling.
*  The other is closed.
*  To haze, it seemed as if all these technicalities undercut the rights that the Crow Act was
*  supposed to enshrine.
*  They made clear that the rules about who owned what and who could go where were cultural
*  and historical artifacts, not laws of nature.
*  They were just choices.
*  Another approach was visible just across the border.
*  In 2003, the Scottish Parliament passed a land reform bill that recognized the uncontested
*  right to walk, camp, cycle, swim, canoe, and perform any other form of non-motorized exploration
*  throughout the country.
*  Known as the right to roam, it came with a code of responsibilities.
*  Access didn't apply to private gardens immediately around houses or to fields in active cultivation,
*  and people were expected to clean up their litter and dog poop, to cook on stoves instead
*  of open fires, to avoid rock climbing near nesting birds, to close gates behind them,
*  and so on.
*  But it was clear and direct and not even unique to Scotland.
*  Similar systems had long been in place in other European countries, including Finland, Norway,
*  Iceland, Austria, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland.
*  In some cases, the right was considered so old and so fundamental, so obvious that for
*  a long time no one bothered to codify it.
*  In Sweden, the tourism board developed an ad campaign around the allure of what the
*  country calls, aleman's ratum, or every man's right.
*  It's a right protected by the law that allows me to sleep and eat and walk pretty much wherever
*  I want.
*  The voiceover explains, now you can too.
*  As Hayes began researching land ownership, he came across the work of Guy Schrubsol,
*  an environmental campaigner who, in an effort to find out who owned the land whose management
*  practices he was worried about, had spent years filing records requests and pouring over
*  maps, writing a blog and later a book called Who Owns England.
*  In answering the question, Schrubsol painted a stark picture of inequality and secrecy.
*  Only 5% of the country was owned by ordinary householders.
*  Large chunks were held by corporations and by the aristocracy and gentry, often following
*  boundaries that were relics of the land divisions and gifts made after the Norman Conquest in 1066.
*  The land registry does not track land using these categories.
*  A few thousand dukes, baronets and country squires own far more land than all of middle
*  England put together Schrubsol wrote.
*  He cited a remark by the late Duke of Westminster, who advised aspiring entrepreneurs in Britain
*  to make sure they have an ancestor who was a very close friend of William Maconcker.
*  If you wanted to know how much of England's land offered no right of access, even to
*  Ramblers, even after the Crow Act, the answer was 92%.
*  Property Schrubsol told me isn't really a thing.
*  It's a bundle of rights.
*  A series of possible actions that are associated with tracts of land, but that can be severed,
*  but sold and expanded or curtailed by the specific legal codes that govern that land.
*  This was why you hear people speak of mineral rights, or surface rights, or water rights,
*  or commoners' rights, or treaty rights, which in the United States often include ongoing
*  rights to fish, hunt and gather on land that tribes no longer control.
*  Part of that bundle of rights in England for the last several hundred years has been
*  the right to exclude other people from your land, Schrubsol says.
*  The thing is, that's not always the case in every country, and even in other liberal
*  capitalist democracies.
*  England had exported its view of private property to much of the world, but it also had
*  its own long history of resistance to privatization.
*  Notable examples include the diggers, who seized a hill in Surrey in 1649, planting crops
*  and declaring to the gentry, the earth was not made purposely for you to be lords of
*  it, and we to be your slaves, servants and beggars, but it was made to be a common livelihood
*  of all.
*  Sure, you can have private property, Schrubsol says, but does it always have to be on such
*  extreme terms that you can't share it with anyone else?
*  In late 2019, the conservative party was elected in a landslide, and proposed charging unpermitted
*  campers with criminal trespass.
*  Hayes and Schrubsol started a petition opposing the idea.
*  They received enough signatures to trigger a debate and parliament, but the bill continued
*  to move forward.
*  Schrubsol remembers sitting with Hayes around a kitchen table in London, wondering what to
*  do next, how to convince their country that access to the land was a right worth fighting
*  for.
*  Shortly afterward, COVID hit.
*  Lockdowns were strict in England, where illicit parties were enough to eventually bring
*  down a once popular Prime Minister.
*  Their gathering places shut down, an outdoor exercise which was allowed only once a day,
*  and only in the area where a person lived, became precious.
*  Catherine Flitcroft, of the British Mount Nearing Council, told me that across the country,
*  the outdoors became the new pub and the new playground, a lifeline for people who felt
*  trapped and alone.
*  But many soon found that a frustrating amount of the countryside was closed off to them.
*  Paths that people had assumed to be legal rights of way turned out to be only permissive
*  paths.
*  Landowners, overwhelmed by the surge of eager walkers, some of whom left large messes behind,
*  could and did revoke access.
*  Swimmers, canoers, climbers and kayakers struggle to understand where they were allowed to go,
*  because many landowners maintained that ownership of a lakefront or riverbed included a right
*  to exclude people from their section of water.
*  So it was illegal to block public paths with gates or fences or to hide signs designating
*  them as such.
*  Or put up new ones threatening dangerous dogs or bulls, would-be walkers told me that
*  they encountered all of this.
*  And community leaders from marginalized groups pointed out that many barriers to access
*  were invisible.
*  People were often dissuaded from rambling at all, because they had good reason to fear
*  the outcome if they ended up somewhere they weren't allowed to be.
*  During that first COVID summer, Hayes' account of his explorations, the book of Trespass,
*  was released.
*  The book argued that the hard-won public paths in enshrining some rights, forced old
*  others, they simultaneously legitimized the space that is off-limits.
*  It soon became a bestseller.
*  Hayes and Shrub Souls set up a campaign website, encouraging people to make their own respectful
*  trespasses into areas that were closed off to them.
*  They also started to work with other organizers to call for a full Scottish style right to
*  Rome in England.
*  Our desire to access nature, they wrote, should not be a crime.
*  The first trespasses were small, groups of friends pouring over local maps, considering
*  the land around them in new ways.
*  In Totneys, the town in Devon where Shrub Souls lives, he and a few others explored very
*  pomeroy, a nearby estate owned by the Duke of Somerset.
*  There was a permissive footpath through one section, but though the estate dominates
*  the landscape, and though it receives taxpayer subsidies, they had never seen the rest.
*  The woods turned out to be full of fesins, non-native gamebirds imported to Britain each
*  year by the tens of millions for shooting.
*  In Devon, local people began holding trespasses every month.
*  As Hayes did while writing his book, they stayed well away from houses and stuck to actions
*  that would be considered trespasses in England, but legal in Scotland.
*  Lewis Winks, a researcher and environmental campaigner who helped organize the gatherings,
*  told me that it felt like being a detective in your own backyard.
*  You were figuring out who owned what and why, and suddenly realizing that there was a
*  great deal more land around than you ever visited or even really noticed.
*  In a group, you felt empowered, almost immune to signs telling you that you didn't belong.
*  You also noticed, he added, that a country that some politicians like to describe as full
*  or overcrowded, and therefore in need of tighter borders, was full of open space.
*  You realize, Winks said, that we basically exist in the corridors between these big
*  estates.
*  In 2022, Parliament passed the promised antitrust passing bill.
*  The core group of right to roam organizers continued to grow while encouraging people
*  to form their own local chapters.
*  In Northumberland, organizers arranged buses to take children who live in light-polluted
*  cities into the countryside at night, because so many English people now grow up without
*  being able to see the Milky Way.
*  In Gloucestershire, trespassers climbed a stone wall into an estate owned by the Duke of
*  Beaufort, where botanists taught attendees about the native plants they found there, the
*  idea being that people who feel attached to a landscape will be inspired to protect
*  it.
*  The campaigners organized another trespass at Barry Pomeroy, this time with hundreds
*  of people who carried a banner that read right to roam and picked up litter as they went.
*  They walked together to a sunny hillside where they picked next.
*  The wholesomeness was purposeful, and attempt to show that people could use land not just
*  responsibly, but also in a nourishing way.
*  Though the campaigns received a fair amount of positive coverage, even the right-leaning
*  daily mail offered a friendly account of the Barry Pomeroy trespass, quoting shrubs souls,
*  less room for fizzence, more room for peasants quip in their headline, there were plenty
*  of doubters.
*  Some seasoned organizers worried that a call for a right to roam might jeopardize the right
*  of way system they have worked so hard to create, or that embracing trespass could give
*  all ramblers a bad name.
*  Landowners associations argued that the current system was adequate and that expanding it would
*  risk public safety.
*  How many more wildfires will there be?
*  How many more sheep will be attacked by dogs?
*  What damage will be done to crops?
*  In his book, Hayes argued that what he called the cult of exclusion was possible because
*  it was undergirded by a powerful story of inevitability, including the belief that open
*  access would mean disrespectful or ignorant people mistreating the land.
*  In the United States, this idea was most vociferously articulated in an essay called The Tragedy
*  of the Commons, written in 1968 by the ecologist and eugenicist Garrett Harden, who argued
*  that it was the fate of any communally managed property to be mismanaged and destroyed.
*  Harden's work has since been widely debunked, including by the Nobel Prize-winning political
*  scientist Eleanor Ostrom, who showed that communities around the world are capable of
*  managing shared resources sustainably.
*  Right to Rome organizers countered that another story was possible, one in which people were
*  educated to appreciate and protect places they saw as partially their own.
*  Amy Jane Beer, one of the core organizers, likes to point to a study by researchers at
*  the University of Derby, which compared 14 European Union countries according to their
*  biodiversity and their residents felt connection to nature.
*  In each case, Britain ranked lowest.
*  Those things are not disconnected, Beer says.
*  People are losing without being aware of what they're losing.
*  And then came Dartmoor.
*  In England, unlike in the United States or in parks in Africa and elsewhere that are
*  sometimes accused of practicing fortress conservation, coordinating off nature at the expense
*  of local people,
*  there's little illusion that a national park is, should or even could be a wild place
*  untouched by human history.
*  Dartmoor is full of ancient archaeological sites, as well as mining scars, good-sized towns,
*  uncountable sheep and ponies, military practice ranges, and even a large prison.
*  You can't visit without understanding the land as a balance of uses.
*  One of those uses today is camping.
*  For decades, Dartmoor was the only park in England that recognized camping among the
*  forms of recreation to which users are entitled.
*  Elsewhere, some people still camp, but they do so somewhat stillfully.
*  You just set up late and pack up early, as Winks told me, or with the understanding that
*  they may be moved along.
*  To quote the leader of a group of backpackers I met, we just kind of walk until we hit
*  somewhere we can't, and then we go somewhere else.
*  Many youth groups, and those who aren't comfortable camping where it isn't allowed,
*  stick to Dartmoor.
*  In 2022, the hedge fund manager Alexander Darwell and his wife Diana, who had purchased
*  a 4,000 acre estate inside Dartmoor, announced that they would be suing the park to keep people
*  from camping on what was now their land.
*  At first, the big access organizations didn't believe that wild camping could really be
*  under threat and paid little attention.
*  A small group of local residents, including Winks, a walking guide named Jillian Healy and
*  others who were organizing trespasses nearby, decided overpints at a pub to plan a rally
*  on one of Darwell's moors to be held shortly after the court was scheduled to rule on the
*  suit.
*  We thought there'd probably be about 15 of us, Winks says.
*  But no matter which way the decision went, they figured they would either want to celebrate
*  or protest.
*  They came up with a name for their group.
*  The stars are for everyone.
*  A week before the planned gathering, in January 2023, the chancellor of the high court ruled
*  that the long assumed right to camp in Dartmoor didn't actually exist.
*  Darwell and any other landowner who wanted to could kick campers out right away.
*  Suddenly, thousands of people wanted to join the protest, which was set to depart from
*  Cornwood, a tiny village clustered around narrow lanes on the edge of the park.
*  The teachers rented 10 buses to shuttle the protesters in.
*  To help feed everyone, residents of the village baked pasties and delivered them to the local
*  pub.
*  A parade of people set off on a two mile walk to Darwell's land, using a right of way flanked
*  on either side by private security guards holding dogs.
*  It was, said one participant, a conga line of humanity.
*  Many people told Healy that they weren't campers themselves, but that they saw the decision
*  as part of a much bigger story about their country and where they fit inside it.
*  Healy agreed.
*  To her, the loss was like a new form of enclosure.
*  That too had been a gradual but devastating winnowing of rights.
*  When the crowd arrived at the top of the hill, organizers were waiting with a surprise.
*  Hiding just behind the crest were a group of musicians and a giant puppet they called
*  Old Crockerne after a mythic figure from Dartmoor's past who has said to be the spirit of
*  the more.
*  In one story, he warns a rich man who has come to plow the land with a steam engine.
*  If you scratch my back, I'll scratch out your pockets.
*  When the puppet crested the hill into the slanting winter sunshine, crowds of children ran toward
*  it, dancing.
*  The Dartmoor National Park Authority appealed the ruling.
*  In the meantime, it came to an agreement with some of the other landowners, paying them
*  to continue to allow camping.
*  What had been a right became a mere permission.
*  Winks found himself camping less because he was no longer sure where it was actually
*  allowed.
*  They've stolen the goose and are selling us back the eggs, he said, and we're told to
*  be grateful.
*  The labor party, for its part, reacted to the news by promising to introduce a Scottish
*  style right to Rome bill the next time it came to power.
*  One spring morning, about a week after the swim at Kinder Reservoir, and five months
*  after the Dartmoor ruling, I met another group of trespassers.
*  This time, they gathered on the village green of a tiny place called Ham, under the branches
*  of a blooming horse chestnut tree.
*  Most of the 70 or so people who arrived for the walk came from Bristol, 20 miles away,
*  home to a particularly active group of right to Rome advocates who meet twice a month
*  and go on outings that members take turns designing.
*  On this day, the walk leader was Jim Rzynski, a member of a local choir who brought along
*  some of his choir mates.
*  Rzynski said that the book of trespass moved him to act because it was just so reasonable.
*  Before setting out, he warned the group to watch out for sharp branch-related jeopardy
*  and to take care with where they placed their feet.
*  We want to show that we can care for the land that we're walking on.
*  The group set off down a narrow lane, crossed a bridge and passed a field where horses grazed.
*  A large stone castle appeared in the distance.
*  A woman named Mary Stevens, who had read Who Owns England, told those gathered that it
*  was still owned by the same family to whom the land was granted in the aftermath of the
*  Norman Conquest.
*  They were also given considerable land in Bristol, where many of the walkers told me, they could
*  not afford to buy houses, including in the neighborhood where the choir practices.
*  The long trail of people wound through fields and into a tiny scrap of woodland where the
*  choir leader, Soral Wild, led the group in an old chant.
*  Put your roots down, put your feet on the ground.
*  You can hear the earth saying, if you listen, we sang, until the words lost their cheesiness
*  and began to feel profound and peaceful.
*  It took ages to enter another glen because there were so many people stepping so cautiously
*  over the blue bells.
*  As they walked, people told me what had brought them to spend their bank holiday Monday
*  trespassing around a castle with strangers.
*  Many spoke about wanting more access to nature, but they also framed the walk in grander
*  terms.
*  Maria Fernandez Garcia, a botanist who had become a leader of the group, said it was a bomb
*  to hear other people's deep and similar feelings about the ways the country wasn't working
*  for ordinary people, and how it could do better.
*  Danny Bala listed a series of things that he wished were seen as commons, to be shared
*  and stewarded, but which were instead enclosed, privatized and exploited, gathering places
*  in cities, the air, the water, the climate.
*  A mother of two young children told me that as a renter, struggling amid Britain's cost
*  of living crisis, it would be very easy to feel that I had very little power, but trespasses
*  like this helped.
*  The more of them she went on, the more illusory the borders that constrained her life felt.
*  It's an antidote to everything feeling divided and enclosed, she said.
*  A woman named Polly Marjoram told me that while walking is often a solitary activity, this
*  version made it feel like part of something large and powerful, connected to a whole
*  world of people who would fight for the land.
*  She had also been to the big trespass at Barry Pomeroy and the protest on Dartmoor.
*  A few months later, in mid-July, the Royal Courts of Justice would hear the park's
*  challenge to the ruling that favored the Dar Wells.
*  Inside the court, the two sides debated what the park's by-laws meant by allowing open-air
*  recreation.
*  Was it ten to open air?
*  Are you recreating when you're asleep?
*  While protesters filled the sidewalk outside, a ruling is still pending.
*  In Ham, after the trespass, the group stomped in a churchyard for lunch, where more thermoses
*  of tea emerged from backpacks.
*  It's nice to imagine a world where we can walk farther and feel freer, set a woman in
*  tall rubber boots.
*  And then it was back to the village green, where some people taught a folk dance, some
*  drifted off to the pub next door, and some sang along to a final song.
*  Ours is a wild and beautiful land, much unknown to us.
*  We are the land, and the land is us.
*  Another group arrived late and dripping, having been lured into the cool river by the
*  first hot day of spring.
*  People kept asking Rosinski which parts of the walk were trespasses, and which parts
*  were within their rights.
*  It had been hard for them to tell.
