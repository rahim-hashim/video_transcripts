# The Sunday Read: ‘The Fight for the Right to Trespass’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxRQliVF5zc)
*  As Americans, I think we're used to the idea that land can be owned.
*  Whether it's a beachfront or, say, a stream bed.
*  And if you own the land, you can, just for example, build on it, or sell its water rights,
*  or you can keep other people from ever accessing it.
*  We just accept it as the way that things naturally work.
*  Like a lot of our laws, we inherited this way of looking at land ownership from England.
*  When I went there, I found that a growing group of people are thinking about ownership
*  of land and access to land very differently than Americans are.
*  And they're thinking that while property might belong to somebody, it doesn't mean
*  other people shouldn't be able to walk on it, or picnic, or camp on it.
*  It's a vision of land and the outdoors that's so radically different from ours that I had
*  to go see it for myself.
*  My name is Brooke Jarvis, and I'm a contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine.
*  This week's Sunday Read is about a group of English activists who are pushing for more
*  rights to explore England's natural spaces.
*  One way these activists do this is through mass trespasses, which are actually a kind
*  of protest that dates back more than a century.
*  They're pushing for something that a lot of other European countries already have.
*  A right to roam.
*  I went to England this past spring, where I joined two of these events.
*  One was at the Kinder Reservoir in the Peak District near Manchester.
*  It lies underneath a tall plateau of moorland called Kinder Scout, which is where one of
*  the most famous trespasses of the 1930s happened.
*  The activists planned to take a dip in the water as a form of protest to show that people
*  needed more access to open water swimming.
*  Everybody, go swimming!
*  Woo!
*  Go, go, go, go!
*  I went to another trespass that was led by someone in a local folk choir in Bristol.
*  We will do the merry-go-round to the sparrow, and we will do the merry-go-round to the hunk
*  of buck and harrow.
*  We headed out to this very old castle that has been in the same family since shortly
*  after the Norman Conquest, and walked around the fields and grounds.
*  We stopped in a little patch of woodlands along the way and sang songs together.
*  The summer is a-coming and the winter's gone away, oh.
*  Many of the activists I wrote about traced the start of their involvement to the pandemic.
*  They had a real hunger to be outside, but they kept finding out that they had a lot
*  less access to the land around them than they'd realized.
*  People told me they felt trapped, walled off from the natural world.
*  There was all this space around them that they couldn't get into, and they began rethinking
*  what was possible.
*  So here's my article, The Fight for the Right to Trespass, read by Gabra Zachman.
*  The signs on the gate at the entrance to the path and along the edge of the reservoir
*  were clear.
*  No swimming, they warned, white letters on a red background.
*  On a chill mid-April day in northwest England, with low gray clouds and rain in the forecast,
*  the signs hardly seemed necessary.
*  But then people began arriving, by the dozens and then the hundreds.
*  Some walked only from nearby Hayfield, while others came by train or bus or foot from many
*  hours away.
*  In a long trailing line, they trampled up the hill beside the dam and around the shore
*  of the reservoir, slipping in mud and jumping over puddles.
*  Above them rose a long, curving hill of open moorland, its heather still winter brown.
*  When they came to a gap between a stone wall and a metal fence, they squeezed through it,
*  one by one, slipping under strings of barbed wire toward the water below.
*  On the steep grassy bank above the reservoir, coats and sweaters came off, revealing wetsuits
*  and swimsuits.
*  Thermoses of tea and hot chocolate were readied for quick access.
*  Someone had brought along a banged-up trumpet with which to provide the appropriate fanfare.
*  There were seasoned winter swimmers, people who had stories of breaking through ice for
*  a dip, and complete newbies, deciding as they shivered whether this particular symbolic
*  act was really for them.
*  There was a seven-year-old who swam in a knit beanie with a purple pom-pom, and a man
*  with a Yorkshire accent who told his wife, in mock horror, I had to ask a strange woman
*  to zip me up, Mary.
*  Down on the shore, giggling and shrieking people picked their way across slippery rocks.
*  Then, with a great deal of cheering and splashing, they took to the water en masse, fanning out
*  in all directions.
*  Someone carried a large banner that read, The Right to Swim.
*  The water was somewhere around 50 degrees Fahrenheit, but it felt, a 61-year-old swimmer
*  announced after climbing out and wrapping up again, bloody wonderful.
*  She handed her sister a cheddar and Branston pickle sandwich, and told me she usually hates
*  encountering crowds when they go swimming, but that this one was delightful.
*  Horror rounds of cheers went up as new waves of swimmers splashed into the water.
*  An older woman wearing a pink floral swimsuit paused on the shore to turn to the crowd still
*  on land.
*  Don't be beaten down, she shouted, raising a fist above her flower-bedecked bathing cap.
*  Rebell!
*  Then she too flopped into the lake.
*  On the bank above the reservoir, a choir serenaded the swimmers.
*  He said, All this land is my master's.
*  At that I stood shaking my head.
*  No man has the right to own mountains, any more than the deep ocean bed.
*  The song, by the folk singer Ewan McCall, was about another mass trespass, one that
*  took place 91 years earlier, above this very reservoir, during which protesters were arrested
*  for daring to walk on hills they were told to keep off.
*  Over the decades that followed, the protesters contentioned that people had some inherent
*  rights of access even to lands they did not own, which in England is most land, because
*  the vast majority of the country is in private hands, was enshrined in law, guaranteeing
*  public access to this and many other parts of the countryside.
*  Lately though, the swimmers told me, those hard-won gains had begun to seem both less
*  expansive and less secure than they once imagined.
*  During the pandemic, many took up open water swimming or paddling or walking, only to be
*  surprised at the number of places they weren't allowed to go.
*  The reservoir, owned by a private utility company, even though it is inside the Peak
*  District National Park, was one such place.
*  England's national parks are full of land that is privately owned, and inhabited, farmed,
*  mined and hunted.
*  The government began to push to criminalize forms of trespass never before considered
*  to be crimes.
*  Then, in January, the High Court sided with a wealthy couple who wanted to keep the public
*  from camping on an estate they bought inside Dartmoor National Park in an area called
*  the Commons, the only place in England where wild camping, what we would call backpacking,
*  was still considered a right.
*  Robert MacFarlane, the English nature writer, called the ruling a nationwide wake-up call.
*  Only when the last relic of a long-lost openness was threatened did it become clear just how
*  much was at stake.
*  Like the trespassers whose anniversary they were commemorating, the swimmers believed
*  they were fighting for something bigger than the chance to walk up a hill or swim in a
*  river, something fundamental about their relationship to the land where they lived.
*  It's not so much that we need to be granted permission, explained a woman with long gray
*  hair and a sweatshirt that read, kayaking is not a crime.
*  It's that we need it to be recognized that we don't need permission.
*  Centuries ago, high moors like those of Kinder Scout, the plateau that stretched above the
*  reservoir, were considered king's land, uncultivated areas to which access was free.
*  In the villages below, land was often claimed by the aristocracy and gentry who collected
*  taxes from the peasants who worked it.
*  But many villagers, called commoners, held shared rights to common land where they could
*  graze their animals or plant crops or gather firewood.
*  This type of land disappeared rapidly during the enclosure movement of the 18th and 19th
*  centuries when the wealthy claimed wild and common lands.
*  Lands that, as the jurist William Blackstone put it, previously belonged generally to everybody
*  but particularly to nobody as their own.
*  The movement leaned on the work of philosophers such as John Locke, who argued that people
*  could gain ownership of waste lands by working and improving them.
*  But there were others who believed that separating people from the land was a gross injustice.
*  What crimes, wars, murders, what miseries and horrors would the human race have been
*  spared, wrote Jean-Jacques Rousseau, by someone who, pulling up the stakes or filling in the
*  ditch, had cried out to his fellow humans, beware of listening to this imposter.
*  You are lost if you forget that the fruits are everyone's and the earth's is no one's.
*  As enclosure spread, many former users of the land were pushed out.
*  With no way to make a living, they drifted to cities.
*  Kinder is not far from Manchester and Sheffield, two early centers of the Industrial Revolution
*  whose residents liked to escape the choking air by going on long walks in the countryside.
*  But many of the landowners who controlled the hills weren't fond of having walkers,
*  known as ramblers, exploring properties they used for raising sheep and hunting grouse.
*  They hired armies of gamekeepers, who sometimes used attack dogs to kick the ramblers out.
*  Some ramblers, in their city lives, were involved in trade unions and other labor movements,
*  and they began to bring the same spirit of organization and protest to their weekend
*  walks.
*  As the most shoutable line of the McCall song has it, I may be a wage slave on Monday, but
*  I am a free man on Sunday.
*  The land they were walking might be private property, they argued, but its owners weren't
*  the only ones with the right to use it.
*  English law acknowledges that a right can be established through long custom, and the
*  walkers were following ancient paths and bridleways onto upland that had only recently been privatized.
*  Some walkers began holding rallies and undertaking purposeful trespasses in places where they
*  knew they would be ejected.
*  This had been going on for decades, when, in April 1932, a rambler named Benny Rothman
*  alerted the press that he and others would be heading up past the reservoir to the plateau
*  above it, an area owned by the Duke of Devonshire.
*  Hundreds of ramblers tussled with keepers, making national headlines.
*  Six were arrested, and five sentenced to as much as six months in jail.
*  At the time, England was home to a number of groups working to protect commons, parks,
*  and walking trails as part of what the campaigner Octavia Hill, at an 1888 meeting of what eventually
*  became the Open Spaces Society, OSS, called, a common possession we ought to try to hand
*  down undiminished in number and in beauty.
*  Most saw the trespassers' actions as counterproductive.
*  Eventually, however, the Kinder Trespass became what the OSS now calls a sacred event in rambling
*  circles, and its leaders' beliefs were more widely embraced.
*  Beginning in the 1940s, Parliament began to codify the idea that people had an inherent
*  right to move across the landscape, culminating in the Countryside Rights of Way, Crow Act
*  in 2000.
*  The Act recognized the right not only to use designated paths, but also to roam freely
*  on certain mountains, moors, heaths, and downs mapped as open country, or on land registered
*  as common.
*  In 2009, the Marine and Coastal Access Act designated the shore as access land as well,
*  and promised an additional 2,700 miles of coastal footpaths.
*  Today, there are about 140,000 miles of legally protected paths in England, and the countryside
*  is full of signs marking public footpaths or rights of way.
*  I found them leading past fields of rapeseed, or sheep, along a creek that flowed behind
*  the walls of private gardens through woods to a country pub.
*  The first time I encountered such a sign, it marked a charming little trail leading
*  over a brook at the end of the lane where I was staying in Little Hayfield.
*  I had other plans for the morning, and only meant to take a tiny walk, but suddenly I
*  couldn't help myself.
*  Having grown up in rural Tennessee, where the no trespassing signs were so ubiquitous
*  as to hardly be necessary, I was overcome by the mere fact of permission.
*  Here was a path to who knew where, on which I was decidedly welcome.
*  Not just welcome, in fact, but entitled.
*  It would have felt almost disrespectful to ignore it.
*  To an American, traversing the land in rural England can feel a bit like looking in a funhouse
*  mirror, a system just different enough that it forces you to see your own expectations
*  in a new way.
*  Some of the people I met in England had heard that the United States has a lot of public
*  land, which is true.
*  But access to it depends a lot on where you live.
*  Nearly all federal land is in just 11 western states and Alaska.
*  And even there, the courts are still working out what public really means.
*  Mulling, for example, when anglers are allowed to walk on public stream beds that run through
*  private property, or whether hunters can cross private airspace by using a ladder to get
*  from one checkerboard square of public land to another.
*  Others had heard that the United States is a warren of private lands, governed by threatening
*  signs and stand your ground laws.
*  The week of the swim trespass, the news back home was full of stories of people being shot
*  after accidentally driving up the wrong driveway or knocking on the wrong door.
*  Kate Rue, the founder of England's Outdoor Swimming Society, remembered with shock when
*  she arrived at the Pacific, eager to swim, but couldn't find a beach that wasn't
*  private property.
*  Another activist, Owen Hayman, told some friends he was visiting in Montana that he was headed
*  out for a walk, and was surprised when they replied that they would first need to drive
*  him somewhere.
*  A farmer I met in Gloucestershire, who thought the English already had plenty of access to
*  his land, nonetheless seemed to sympathize with my plight as an American.
*  You can't go anywhere, can you?
*  After following that first right-of-way sign, I stumbled on a spring full of plump tadpoles
*  and followed a red-striped bumblebee from flower to flower.
*  I thought about how nice the word ramble was, how it evoked wandering and whimsy and openness
*  instead of the determined point-to-point rush of the American hike.
*  I navigated a brief standoff with a pair of rams, soaked my feet in a boggy cow pasture,
*  and skirted private houses.
*  One resident nodded politely from behind a sign, Please Respect Our Privacy, that I liked
*  rather better than the sign one of my mother's neighbors in the United States displays on
*  her mailbox.
*  If you can read this, you're in range.
*  I emerged at the top of a hill called Lantern Pike, said to have gotten its name because
*  it once served as a place to light beacon fires.
*  In one direction, I could see the buildings of Manchester, and in the other, the long
*  brown line of Kinder Scout notched in the middle where a waterfall tumbles down.
*  Below it were fields of bright green pasture, squared in by dark stone walls.
*  A little over a decade ago, a young illustrator named Nick Hayes was staying with his parents
*  in West Berkshire, not far from London, while he worked on a graphic novel.
*  One day, walking near a lightning-struck willow, he spotted a kingfisher, the first he ever
*  saw.
*  He hoped to show it to his mother, but as they approached the tree, a man on a four-wheeler
*  raced over, announcing, You've no right to be here.
*  You're trespassing.
*  The pair immediately turned around.
*  Hayes walked home, struck by the power of that single word.
*  He typed trespass into a search engine, surprised to learn that his actions were merely a civil
*  offence, typically punishable only in the case of property damage, and that trespass
*  hadn't always been considered an offence at all.
*  The more he read, the more Hayes began to believe that the building of a wall, not the
*  climbing of it, was the bigger crime.
*  He began working on a book about what he was learning, taking himself on small trespasses
*  around the country, climbing over the walls of large estates or slipping past them by
*  kayak.
*  Sometimes there was shouting.
*  Sometimes threats.
*  Everywhere he found reminders of a long, ever-evolving relationship with the land.
*  It was in the land use, the fox hunts and deer parks of the wealthy, and in the literature,
*  all that wide-open walking and Tolkien and Wordsworth, and in the language.
*  Beyond the pale originates from the Middle English word for fence, and acre comes from
*  the Old English for open field, though the word eventually stopped meaning unoccupied
*  land and came to define standardized measures by which land could be bought and sold.
*  You can chuck a stone in England and there's a story of land dispossession wherever it
*  lands, Hayes told me when I first spoke to him last year.
*  Fencing people off from nature, he believed, caused each to suffer.
*  People felt bereft and disconnected, and problems like pollution or biodiversity loss became
*  less visible, harder to care about.
*  Hayes became convinced that society put too much emphasis on the sacredness of private
*  property and the accompanying threat of trespass.
*  Kinder trespass was evidence of that.
*  To cheer a man for walking through heather, and likewise to beat him up for it, are both
*  absurdly disproportionate to the act itself, he wrote.
*  But inside the logic of the bubble, such an act is tantamount to anarchy because it threatens
*  the spell.
*  In this context, even the Crow Act began to look less like a victory for the public
*  and more like a consolation prize that disguised how much had already been lost.
*  The right of way officially applies only to movement.
*  Paths are for walking and bridal ways for riding, not for camping or picnicking or drawing
*  or hula hooping.
*  Paths and access land are concentrated in the least populated rural regions and are
*  scarce where most people live.
*  Many protected areas are difficult to navigate.
*  People who spend time in the countryside rely on detailed maps from the government to figure
*  out where they are or aren't allowed to walk.
*  Echoing their military heritage, they're called OS, or Ordnance Survey Maps.
*  Some places offer no real access because they are islands floating in a sea of private property.
*  You would need a helicopter or a parachute to get to them, while others require constant
*  vigilance to keep open.
*  In one famous case, a company associated with the tycoon Nicholas van Hoogstraten, who was
*  known for his involvement in the killing of a business rival and once referred to Ramblers
*  as scum of the earth, erected buildings and fences that blocked a protected right of way
*  in East Sussex.
*  The path was closed for 13 years before Hoogstraten lost in court and Kate Ashbrook, a former
*  chairwoman of the Ramblers and now General Secretary of the OSS, reopened the path by
*  taking a pair of bolt cutters to a padlocked gate.
*  The Crow Act was also time limited.
*  There is likely less than a decade left during which new access paths can be certified.
*  But the process for adding them is Byzantine.
*  To certify a right of way, you have to prove that you've never asked a landowner for
*  permission to walk there, which turns a right into a retractable handout, that you have
*  used it for at least 20 years, an accepted stand-in for proof that a right has been earned
*  by virtue of being exercised since time immemorial, a period which, because of quirks of English
*  law, officially ended with the death of Henry II in 1189, and that you and others have used
*  the path openly without your right to do so being challenged.
*  Open access land cannot have been improved by agriculture, proof of which often requires
*  expensive certifications by botanists.
*  This can lead to absurdity, says Ashbrooke, who likes to walk up a hill near her house
*  in the Chilterns.
*  It looks the same all over, but because of what Ashbrooke described as botanical issues
*  of great detail, only one side qualified as access land open for rambling.
*  The other is closed.
*  To Hayes, it seemed as if all these technicalities undercut the rights that the Crow Act was
*  supposed to enshrine.
*  They made clear that the rules about who owned what and who could go where were cultural
*  and historical artifacts, not laws of nature.
*  They were just choices.
*  Another approach was visible just across the border.
*  In 2003, the Scottish Parliament passed a land reform bill that recognized the uncontested
*  right to walk, camp, cycle, swim, canoe, and perform any other form of non-motorized exploration
*  throughout the country.
*  Known as the right to roam, it came with a code of responsibilities.
*  Access didn't apply to private gardens immediately around houses or to fields in active cultivation,
*  and people were expected to clean up their litter and dog poop, to cook on stoves instead
*  of open fires, to avoid rock climbing near nesting birds, to close gates behind them,
*  and so on.
*  But it was clear and direct, and not even unique to Scotland.
*  Other systems had long been in place in other European countries, including Finland, Norway,
*  Iceland, Austria, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland.
*  In some cases, the right was considered so old and so fundamental, so obvious, that for
*  a long time no one bothered to codify it.
*  In Sweden, the Tourism Board developed an ad campaign around the allure of what the
*  country calls Allemandsraten, or Everyman's Right.
*  It's a right protected by the law that allows me to sleep and eat and walk pretty much wherever
*  I want, the voiceover explains.
*  Now you can too.
*  As Hayes began researching land ownership, he came across the work of Guy Shrubsoll,
*  an environmental campaigner who, in an effort to find out who owned the land whose management
*  about, had spent years filing records requests and pouring over maps, writing a blog and
*  later a book called Who Owns England?
*  In answering the question, Shrubsoll painted a stark picture of inequality and secrecy.
*  Only 5% of the country was owned by ordinary householders.
*  Large chunks were held by corporations and by the aristocracy and gentry, often following
*  boundaries that were relics of the land divisions and gifts made after the Norman Conquest
*  in 1066.
*  The Land Registry does not track land using these categories.
*  A few thousand dukes, baronets, and country squires own far more land than all of Middle
*  England put together, Shrubsoll wrote.
*  He cited a remark by the late Duke of Westminster, who advised aspiring entrepreneurs in Britain
*  to make sure they have an ancestor who was a very close friend of William the Conqueror.
*  If you wanted to know how much of England's land offered no right of access, even to Ramblers,
*  even after the Crow Act, the answer was 92%.
*  Property, Shrubsoll told me, isn't really a thing.
*  It's a bundle of rights.
*  A series of possible actions that are associated with tracts of land, but that can be severed,
*  bought, sold, and expanded or curtailed by the specific legal codes that govern that
*  land.
*  That's why you hear people speak of mineral rights, or surface rights, or water rights,
*  or commoners' rights, or treaty rights, which in the United States often include ongoing
*  rights to fish, hunt, and gather on land that tribes no longer control.
*  Part of that bundle of rights in England for the last several hundred years has been the
*  right to exclude other people from your land, Shrubsoll says.
*  The thing is, that's not always the case in every country, and even in other liberal,
*  capitalist democracies.
*  England had exported its view of private property to much of the world, but it also
*  had its own long history of resistance to privatization.
*  Notable examples include the diggers, who seized a hill in Surrey in 1649, planting
*  crops and declaring to the gentry, the earth was not made purposely for you, to be lords
*  of it, and we to be your slaves, servants, and beggars, but it was made to be a common
*  livelihood of all.
*  Sure, you can have private property, Shrubsoll says, but does it always have to be on such
*  extreme terms that you can't share it with anyone else?
*  In late 2019, the Conservative Party was elected in a landslide, and proposed charging unpermitted
*  campers with criminal trespass.
*  Hayes and Shrubsoll started a petition opposing the idea.
*  It received enough signatures to trigger a debate in parliament, but the bill continued
*  to move forward.
*  Shrubsoll remembers sitting with Hayes around a kitchen table in London, wondering what
*  to do next, how to convince their country that access to the land was a right worth
*  fighting for.
*  Shortly afterward, COVID hit.
*  Lockdowns were strict in England, where illicit parties were enough to eventually bring down
*  a once-popular prime minister.
*  Indoor gathering places shut down, and outdoor exercise, which was allowed only once a day,
*  and only in the area where a person lived, became precious.
*  Catherine Flitcroft of the British Mountaineering Council told me that across the country,
*  the outdoors became the new pub and the new playground, a lifeline for people who felt
*  trapped and alone.
*  But many soon found that a frustrating amount of the countryside was closed off to them.
*  Paths that people had assumed to be legal rights of way turned out to be only permissive
*  paths.
*  Landowners, overwhelmed by the surge of eager walkers, some of whom left large messes behind,
*  could and did revoke access.
*  Swimmers, canoers, climbers, and kayakers struggled to understand where they were allowed
*  to go, because many landowners maintained that ownership of a lakefront or riverbed
*  included a right to exclude people from their section of water.
*  Though it was illegal to block public paths with gates or fences, or to hide signs designating
*  them as such, or put up new ones threatening dangerous dogs or bulls, would-be walkers
*  told me that they encountered all of this.
*  And community leaders from marginalized groups pointed out that many barriers to access were
*  invisible.
*  People were often dissuaded from rambling at all because they had good reason to fear
*  the outcome if they ended up somewhere they weren't allowed to be.
*  During that first COVID summer, Hayes's account of his explorations, The Book of Trespass,
*  was released.
*  The book argued that the hard-won public paths in enshrining some rights, forestalled others.
*  They simultaneously legitimized the space that is off-limits.
*  It soon became a best-seller.
*  Hayes and Shrub Soul set up a campaign website encouraging people to make their own respectful
*  trespasses into areas that were closed off to them.
*  They also started to work with other organizers to call for a full Scottish-style right to
*  Rome in England.
*  Their desire to access nature, they wrote, should not be a crime.
*  The first trespasses were small, groups of friends poring over local maps, considering
*  the land around them in new ways.
*  In Totneys, the town in Devon where Shrub Soul lives, he and a few others explored Barry
*  Pomeroy, a nearby estate owned by the Duke of Somerset.
*  There was a permissive footpath through one section.
*  But though the estate dominates the landscape, and though it receives taxpayer subsidies,
*  they had never seen the rest.
*  The woods turned out to be full of pheasants, non-native game birds imported to Britain
*  each year by the tens of millions for shooting.
*  In Devon, local people began holding trespasses every month.
*  As Hayes did while writing his book, they stayed well away from houses and stuck to
*  actions that would be considered trespasses in England, but legal in Scotland.
*  Lewis Wincks, a researcher and environmental campaigner who helped organize the gatherings,
*  told me that it felt like being a detective in your own backyard.
*  You were figuring out who owned what and why, and suddenly realizing that there was a great
*  deal more land around than you ever visited or even really noticed.
*  Moving in a group, you felt empowered, almost immune to signs telling you that you didn't
*  belong.
*  You also noticed, he added, that a country that some politicians like to describe as
*  full or overcrowded, and therefore in need of tighter borders, was full of open space.
*  You realize, Wincks said, that we basically exist in the corridors between these big estates.
*  In 2022, Parliament passed the promised anti-trespassing bill.
*  The core group of Right to Rome organizers continued to grow while encouraging people
*  to form their own local chapters.
*  In Northumberland, organizers arranged buses to take children who live in light-polluted
*  cities into the countryside at night because so many English people now grow up without
*  being able to see the Milky Way.
*  In Gloucestershire, trespassers climbed a stone wall into an estate owned by the Duke
*  of Beaufort, where botanists taught attendees about the native plants they found there,
*  the idea being that people who feel attached to a landscape will be inspired to protect
*  it.
*  The campaigners organized another trespass at Barry-Palmeroy, this time with hundreds
*  of people who carried a banner that read Right to Rome and picked up litter as they
*  went.
*  They walked together to a sunny hillside, where they picnicked.
*  The wholesomeness was purposeful, an attempt to show that people could use land not just
*  responsibly but also in a nourishing way.
*  Though the campaigns received a fair amount of positive coverage, even the right-leaning
*  Daily Mail offered a friendly account of the Barry-Palmeroy Trespass, quoting shrubsouls,
*  Less room for pheasants, more room for peasants, quip in their headline.
*  There were plenty of doubters.
*  Some seasoned organizers worried that a call for a right to Rome might jeopardize the right-of-way
*  system they have worked so hard to create, or that embracing trespass could give all
*  ramblers a bad name.
*  Landowners' associations argued that the current system was adequate and that expanding
*  it would risk public safety.
*  How many more wildfires will there be?
*  How many more sheep will be attacked by dogs?
*  What damage will be done to crops?
*  In his book, Hayes argued that what he called the cult of exclusion was possible because
*  it was undergirded by a powerful story of inevitability, including the belief that open
*  access would mean disrespectful or ignorant people mistreating the land.
*  In the United States, this idea was most vociferously articulated in an essay called The Tragedy
*  of the Commons, written in 1968 by the ecologist and eugenicist Garrett Hardin, who argued
*  that it was the fate of any communally managed property to be mismanaged and destroyed.
*  Hardin's work has since been widely debunked, including by the Nobel Prize-winning political
*  scientist Eleanor Ostrom, who showed that communities around the world are capable of
*  managing shared resources sustainably.
*  Right to Rome organizers countered that another story was possible, one in which people were
*  educated to appreciate and protect places they saw as partially their own.
*  Amy-Jane Beer, one of the core organizers, likes to point to a study by researchers at
*  the University of Derby, which compared 14 European Union countries according to their
*  biodiversity and their residents' felt connection to nature.
*  In each case, Britain ranked lowest.
*  Those things are not disconnected, Beer says.
*  People are losing without being aware of what they're losing.
*  And then came Dartmoor.
*  In England, unlike in the United States or in parks in Africa and elsewhere that are
*  sometimes accused of practicing fortress conservation, cordoning off nature at the expense of local
*  people, there's little illusion that a national park is, should, or even could be a wild place
*  untouched by human history.
*  Dartmoor is full of ancient archaeological sites as well as mining scars, good-sized
*  towns, uncountable sheep and ponies, military practice ranges, and even a large prison.
*  You can't visit without understanding the land as a balance of uses.
*  One of those uses, today, is camping.
*  For decades, Dartmoor was the only park in England that recognized camping among the
*  forms of recreation to which users are entitled.
*  Elsewhere, some people still camp, but they do so somewhat stillfully.
*  You just set up late and pack up early, as Winx told me, or with the understanding that
*  they may be moved along.
*  To quote the leader of a group of backpackers I met, we just kind of walk until we hit somewhere
*  we can't, and then we go somewhere else.
*  Many youth groups, and those who aren't comfortable camping where it isn't allowed, stick to
*  Dartmoor.
*  In 2022, the hedge fund manager Alexander Darwell and his wife Diana, who had purchased
*  a 4,000-acre estate inside Dartmoor, announced that they would be suing the park to keep
*  people from camping on what was now their land.
*  At first, the big access organizations didn't believe that wild camping could really be
*  under threat and paid little attention.
*  A small group of local residents, including Winx, a walking guide named Jillian Healy
*  and others who were organizing trespasses nearby, decided, over pints at a pub, to plan
*  a rally on one of Darwell's moors to be held shortly after the court was scheduled to rule
*  on the suit.
*  We thought there'd probably be about 15 of us, Winx says, but no matter which way
*  the decision went, they figured they would either want to celebrate or protest.
*  They came up with a name for their group.
*  The Stars Are For Everyone.
*  A week before the planned gathering, in January 2023, the chancellor of the high court ruled
*  that the long-assumed right to camp in Dartmoor didn't actually exist.
*  Darwell, and any other landowner who wanted to, could kick campers out right away.
*  Suddenly, thousands of people wanted to join the protest, which was set to depart from
*  Cornwood, a tiny village clustered around narrow lanes on the edge of the park.
*  Organizers rented 10 buses to shuttle the protesters in.
*  To help feed everyone, residents of the village baked pasties and delivered them to the local pub.
*  A parade of people set off on a two-mile walk to Darwell's land, using a right-of-way flanked
*  on either side by private security guards holding dogs.
*  It was, said one participant, a conga line of humanity.
*  Many people told Healy that they weren't campers themselves, but that they saw the decision
*  as part of a much bigger story about their country and where they fit inside it.
*  Healy agreed. To her, the loss was like a new form of enclosure.
*  That, too, had been a gradual but devastating winnowing of rights.
*  When the crowd arrived at the top of the hill, organizers were waiting with a surprise.
*  Hiding just behind the crest were a group of musicians and a giant puppet they called
*  Old Crocern, after a mythic figure from Dartmoor's past who is said to be the spirit of the moor.
*  In one story, he warns a rich man who has come to plow the land with a steam engine,
*  If you scratch my back, I'll scratch out your pockets.
*  When the puppet crested the hill into the slanting winter sunshine,
*  crowds of children ran toward it, dancing.
*  The Dartmoor National Park Authority appealed the ruling.
*  In the meantime, it came to an agreement with some of the other landowners,
*  paying them to continue to allow camping. What had been a right became a mere permission.
*  Winx found himself camping less because he was no longer sure where it was actually allowed.
*  They've stolen the goose and are selling us back the eggs, he said, and we're told to be grateful.
*  The Labour Party, for its part, reacted to the news by promising to introduce a Scottish-style
*  Right to Rome bill the next time it came to power.
*  One spring morning, about a week after the swim at Kinder Reservoir,
*  and five months after the Dartmoor ruling, I met another group of trespassers.
*  This time, they gathered on the village green of a tiny place called Ham,
*  under the branches of a blooming horse chestnut tree.
*  Most of the 70 or so people who arrived for the walk came from Bristol, 20 miles away,
*  home to a particularly active group of Right to Rome advocates who meet twice a month
*  and go on outings that members take turns designing.
*  On this day, the walk leader was Jim Rosinski, a member of a local choir,
*  who brought along some of his choir mates. Rosinski said that the book of trespass
*  moved him to act because it was just so reasonable. Before setting out, he warned the group to watch
*  out for sharp branch-related jeopardy and to take care with where they place their feet.
*  We want to show that we can care for the land that we're walking on.
*  The group set off down a narrow lane, crossed a bridge, and passed a field where horses grazed.
*  A large stone castle appeared in the distance. A woman named Mary Stevens,
*  who had read Who Owns England, told those gathered that it was still owned by the same
*  family to whom the land was granted in the aftermath of the Norman conquest.
*  They were also given considerable land in Bristol, where, many of the walkers told me,
*  they could not afford to buy houses, including in the neighborhood where the choir practices.
*  The long trail of people wound through fields and into a tiny scrap of woodland,
*  where the choir leader, Sorrel Wild, led the group in an old chant.
*  Put your roots down. Put your feet on the ground. You can hear the earth sing, if you listen,
*  we sang, until the words lost their cheesiness and began to feel profound and peaceful.
*  It took ages to enter another glen because there were so many people stepping so cautiously over
*  the bluebells. As they walked, people told me what had brought them to spend their bank holiday Monday
*  trespassing around a castle with strangers. Many spoke about wanting more access to nature,
*  but they also framed the walk in grander terms. Maria Fernandez-Garcia, a botanist who had become
*  a leader of the group, said it was a balm to hear other people's deep and similar feelings about
*  the ways the country wasn't working for ordinary people and how it could do better. Danny Bala
*  listed a series of things that he wished were seen as commons to be shared and stewarded,
*  but which were instead enclosed, privatized, and exploited,
*  gathering places in cities, the air, the water, the climate.
*  A mother of two young children told me that as a renter struggling amid Britain's cost of living
*  crisis, it would be very easy to feel that I had very little power. But trespasses like this helped.
*  The more of them she went on, the more illusory the borders that constrained her life felt.
*  It's an antidote to everything feeling divided and enclosed, she said.
*  A woman named Holly Margerum told me that while walking is often a solitary activity,
*  this version made it feel like part of something large and powerful, connected to a whole world of
*  people who would fight for the land. She had also been to the big trespass at Berry-Palmeroy
*  and the protest on Dartmoor. A few months later, in mid-July, the Royal Courts of Justice would
*  hear the park's challenge to the ruling that favored the Darwells. Inside the court, the two
*  sides debated what the park's bylaws meant by allowing open-air recreation. Was a tent open air?
*  Are you recreating when you're asleep? While protesters filled the sidewalk outside.
*  A ruling is still pending. In Ham, after the trespass, the group stopped in a churchyard for
*  lunch, where more thermoses of tea emerged from backpacks.
*  It's nice to imagine a world where we can walk farther and feel freer, said a woman in tall
*  rubber boots. And then it was back to the Village Green, where some people taught a folk dance,
*  some drifted off to the pub next door, and some sang along to a final song.
*  Ours is a wild and beautiful land, much unknown to us. We are the land.
*  And the land is us. Another group arrived late and dripping, having been lured into the Cool River
*  by the first hot day of spring. People kept asking Rosinski which parts of the walk were
*  trespasses and which parts were within their rights. It had been hard for them to tell.
