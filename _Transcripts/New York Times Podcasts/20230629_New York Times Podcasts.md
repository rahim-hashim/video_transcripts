# Is Washington Finally Ready to Take On Big Tech?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEVeSuWaVbk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Katrin Benholt.
*  This is The Daily.
*  This week, in a San Francisco courtroom, federal regulators are fighting to block one of the
*  biggest deals in the history of Silicon Valley.
*  Today, my colleague David McCabe, on the architect of that lawsuit, Lina Khan, and the growing
*  campaign by the Biden administration to finally rein in Big Tech.
*  It's Thursday, June 29th.
*  David, this is only the second episode I've hosted of The Daily, and I think it is the
*  first the show has ever devoted to the Federal Trade Commission.
*  And that may be because, frankly, even saying those words just made me a little sleepy.
*  Tell me why I shouldn't be sleepy.
*  You shouldn't be sleepy because the Federal Trade Commission is the regulator that is
*  tasked with making sure that capitalism works in the United States.
*  So the cases that they bring are bellwethers for how big companies end up getting regulated
*  and how powerful they are able to become.
*  And one of those cases is playing out this week.
*  That makes a lot of sense, and that has woken me up.
*  Good.
*  OK, so tell me about this case.
*  We're going to start with one of the biggest deals of the decade, Microsoft's long-running
*  $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
*  The Federal Trade Commission is trying to stop Microsoft, which makes the Xbox video
*  game console, along with being involved in a ton of other businesses, from buying Activision
*  Blizzard, which publishes some of the biggest video games in the world.
*  Including Activision's first-person shooter, Call of Duty.
*  Probably most importantly, the Call of Duty franchise.
*  And one of the most popular mobile games, Candy Crush.
*  And right now in San Francisco, a judge is deciding whether or not the FTC's case is
*  good enough that they should temporarily block this deal from closing so that this
*  big challenge to this acquisition can go forward.
*  After all, while it was pitched as an acquisition, in some ways it's more of a merger between
*  two of the five biggest gaming companies globally.
*  And this case is actually important in a bigger way, which is that it's a key indicator for
*  whether or not government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission can stop big tech
*  from getting bigger.
*  So explain that.
*  How do you mean?
*  So over the last five or so years, there's been really mounting concern, not just in
*  Washington but in world capitals like Brussels and London, over how big Silicon Valley companies
*  have gotten.
*  And we're talking really here about five companies.
*  Amazon, Google, Apple, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Microsoft.
*  And the critics of these companies believe that they've become these kind of insurmountable
*  gatekeepers for commerce and communications and basically like our whole lives online.
*  And governments have responded by saying there's a problem here.
*  But now the question is, can anybody actually take action to rein these companies in or
*  will they just get more powerful?
*  And it seems to be one of those rare issues where you actually have support on both sides
*  of the aisle, where you kind of have mainstream figures, you know, from Bernie Sanders to
*  Joe Biden and Josh Hawley, all of whom sort of agree something needs to be done to regulate
*  big tech.
*  That's right. It's the rare bipartisan consensus in Washington right now that these companies
*  have gotten really big and really powerful and the government maybe should do something
*  about it.
*  But Congress in particular has really struggled to figure out what that is.
*  They proposed a lot of laws and they haven't gone anywhere.
*  And so when Congress can't make new laws to regulate the tech giants, it means the only
*  tool that the government has to pursue these companies is the laws on the books.
*  And that means that the questions about are these companies too powerful and what should
*  the government do have really fallen to regulators like the Federal Trade Commission.
*  And that agency has started to take on these tech giants in a way that it hasn't before.
*  And the architect and face of that pivot is the FTC's new chair, Lena Kahn.
*  Okay, so tell me about Lena Kahn.
*  So Lena Kahn has had a meteoric rise to lead the Federal Trade Commission.
*  And it all really starts in 2017.
*  Yeah, I'm Lena Kahn.
*  I'm a visiting fellow at Yale Law School.
*  So in 2017, not that long ago, Lena Kahn was a law student and she was at Yale Law School.
*  I wrote a piece called Amazon's Antitrust Paradox that tells the story of Amazon's rise.
*  And she writes this essay for the Law Review, as a lot of law students do, right, about
*  Amazon.
*  I think increasingly businesses are not able to compete on the merits with Amazon.
*  I actually think the way that she describes it in the paper is really instructive of how
*  she views the company in these tech platforms.
*  So she writes, in addition to being a retailer, Amazon is now a marketing platform, a delivery
*  and logistics network, a payment service, a credit lender, an auction house, a major
*  book publisher, a producer of television and films, a fashion designer, a hardware manufacturer,
*  and a leading host of cloud server space.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, we all know how huge Amazon is in our lives, but it's quite startling to hear
*  this list of things that it does.
*  You know, one company that spans so many industries and roles basically sells things, competes
*  against other selling things, and owns the platform where all of these transactions happen
*  as well.
*  That's right.
*  And this idea of a platform business is really crucial to understanding Lena Kahn's concerns.
*  Because it's not just Amazon.
*  Amazon is a clear example of it.
*  But Apple runs a platform in the form of its app store, right?
*  Apple sells apps.
*  They also run the main store where other people sell apps.
*  Google runs a search engine that includes results from websites like, say, reviews of
*  a restaurant.
*  Google also has its own review service.
*  So what she's articulating is that these sort of mega platforms have grown without a lot
*  of attention from government and are posing real problems for competition in the economy.
*  So David, what is the solution she proposes in this paper?
*  So this is where we go back to the past a little bit.
*  Lena Kahn is telling a story about history.
*  Anti-trust laws were passed around the turn of the century at a time when there were these
*  big trusts, the most classic which is Standard Oil, which made the Rockefeller family rich.
*  And over time, they were used to break up Standard Oil, to break up other big companies.
*  But the reality is that some of anti-trust law is written down in the laws, and some
*  of anti-trust law is about how judges interpret it.
*  And what Lena Kahn is saying is that in the 1970s, conservative lawyers, academics, economists
*  were able to shift the way anti-trust law is understood by the courts.
*  And that instead of considering a whole range of harms to competition, to the economy, that
*  the courts were now basically considering in most cases one factor to decide whether
*  or not something violated anti-trust law.
*  And that was whether or not it hurt consumers, and particularly whether or not it hurt consumers
*  in the form of higher prices.
*  So what you're saying is that since the 1970s, the definition of anti-trust in a way was
*  that as long as prices remained low and consumers happy, regulators left big companies alone.
*  Yeah, for the most part.
*  And so in this paper, Lena Kahn is basically saying that the government and the courts
*  should widen the scope of what falls under anti-trust laws in a way that she would argue
*  basically returns it to the tool it once was in American history.
*  That even though Amazon keeps prices very low, that it's still engaging in all these
*  practices that could harm competition, potentially to the detriment of people, including other
*  smaller companies who sell on its platform.
*  So price alone is no longer like a useful and valuable indicator for when to apply anti-trust practices.
*  That's exactly what she's saying.
*  So David, one way to think about this, as I'm listening to you, is that even though
*  anti-trust laws were originally designed to prevent the concentration of corporate power,
*  ironically, it seems that in recent decades, it's almost like they have favored market
*  concentration by focusing so much on lower prices and consumer happiness.
*  And now Lena Kahn wants the FTC to return to that original mission.
*  That's right.
*  That's how she sees the central failing of the government in the preceding 30 years.
*  They essentially were asleep at the switch while these companies got extremely big and
*  extremely powerful.
*  And ultimately, I think the case that Lena Kahn is making is that, yes, consumers are
*  one part of the broader world, but the government needs to think about the economy more broadly
*  than it needs to think about.
*  Does concentration in the economy mean workers get paid less?
*  Does it mean that it's harder to start a startup that might come up with some sort of genius,
*  innovative product?
*  And that when you consider all of those things together, that you have a healthier and more
*  dynamic economy and ultimately democracy.
*  And how do people react to her paper?
*  So with the caveat that we're talking about a law review article, it goes viral.
*  In a report for the Yale Law Journal, Lena Kahn writes that Amazon's dominance may soon
*  challenge current anti-trust laws.
*  She joins us now to explain why.
*  And Lena Kahn, who again is in her 20s at this time, has just finished up law school,
*  is suddenly subject to a ton of media attention.
*  This woman's name is Lena Kahn.
*  She's kind of rising to prominence among the anti-trust circles down in DC.
*  She wrote a big paper for the Yale Law School.
*  And suddenly she's kind of a celebrity.
*  She's profiled in the New York Times by my colleague David Streitfeld.
*  She's also profiled in the Atlantic, in the Washington Post.
*  There was a piece out of Yale Law School that I sent around as well.
*  It would be a different approach, though, to anti-trust doctrine to make it clear.
*  And part of what this article triggers is a big debate about whether or not Lena Kahn
*  is right or coming in with basically an attack on bigness for bigness' sake that actually
*  won't be good for consumers.
*  We have a society that says consumers come first, investors come second, and workers
*  come third.
*  And I think we're beginning to question that rubric.
*  And she becomes a face of what is now kind of a ballooning movement of people who think
*  that these big tech companies have gotten too big.
*  My argument is that Amazon is challenging the current paradigm in anti-trust, which
*  primarily looks at consumer prices as a metric for whether markets are competitive.
*  And suddenly all of these people are paying attention to this argument that the regulators
*  who are tasked with reining in American corporations have failed to do so.
*  And what happens to Lena Kahn after she graduates from law school?
*  So she goes into government.
*  She ends up working briefly for the FTC as an aide to a progressive commissioner.
*  Then she goes to Congress and she's a staff member on this big investigation that Congress
*  did into the power of the tech platforms.
*  And then she becomes a law professor at Columbia.
*  But then Joe Biden gets elected president.
*  And in 2021, he's staffing up his administration and he names her as one of the five commissioners
*  on the Federal Trade Commission.
*  An important thing to understand about the FTC is that there are five commissioners who
*  vote on whether or not they'll take actions against companies.
*  And then one of them is the chair.
*  And that person is the one who really decides the direction of the agency.
*  So she's been named one of those five commissioners, but not the chair.
*  And so this is on its own a big win for the antitrust reformers.
*  She's this young rising star.
*  And now here she is in a position of real influence.
*  And her nomination is approved by the Senate, 69 to 28.
*  So she gets some Republican support.
*  And then that same day, hours, hours after the Senate vote, Biden surprises everyone
*  by announcing that she will in fact be named chair of the whole agency.
*  It's fascinating.
*  So just a few years after Lina Khan published her paper criticizing Amazon in the Yale
*  Law Review as a kind of unknown law student, not even graduated yet, she is appointed to
*  the FTC, the government body that is tasked with actually regulating companies like Amazon.
*  That's right.
*  She's 32 years old and the most influential person at the Federal Trade Commission.
*  And in fact, Joe Biden also names other big antitrust reformers to key positions in the
*  government.
*  So now this movement that, you know, five years earlier was largely producing scholarly
*  and journalistic work about what they saw as this big problem are in the sea of power
*  in the agencies that can actually do something about it.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, at 32 years old, Lina Khan, who has not been shy about her ambition of going
*  after Big Tech, is now the head of the FTC.
*  So what does she do when she gets there?
*  Well, before she does anything, it won't shock you to hear that her appointment attracts
*  the attention of the companies she has been criticizing.
*  So both Amazon and Facebook within about a month of her being named chair, ask that she
*  be recused from any investigations into the companies.
*  They sound scared.
*  Well, they've certainly noticed that she's in charge now and ultimately she has so far
*  opted not to recuse from either matter.
*  So pretty soon it becomes clear that Lina Khan is interested in running a more aggressive
*  FTC and it takes a while to build these cases.
*  But of course, the big question is still, what is she going to do about the big tech
*  platforms, the ones that she highlighted in her paper?
*  And we get the first hint towards the end of 2021 when Meta decides that it's going
*  to buy a virtual reality startup called Within.
*  Now Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp, in recent years has been trying
*  to make this pivot to what they call the metaverse.
*  This is like a virtual reality world or an augmented reality world where people hang
*  out, they go to work, you know, you and I record this podcast in virtual reality, and
*  it's a big part of their strategy.
*  And they produce virtual reality headsets as part of this.
*  And so they buy this company that makes a virtual reality fitness game.
*  It's a way to exercise, you know, with one of these headsets on.
*  And these companies, the big tech companies, have acquired a lot of startups.
*  And this deal is reported to be around $400 million, which I've been in business journalism
*  maybe too long, anything under a billion dollars, people think of as small, certainly like not
*  a blockbuster deal, right?
*  This is a big company buying a small company.
*  The small company gets paid out, the big company gets the virtual reality fitness game.
*  And on top of that, we're talking about virtual reality, which is a really nascent technology,
*  right?
*  It's not proliferated throughout offices and schools, as some people think maybe it will.
*  But in July of 2022, the FTC sues to block this deal.
*  So how does Lina Khan see this case?
*  Why is she pursuing this particular case?
*  So even though the actual number value on the deal isn't that high, she says that by
*  acquiring this company, Metta is going to be able to try and dominate basically going
*  forward this young market for virtual reality.
*  And remember how like part of the concerns that she has are that the regulators are basically
*  asleep at the wheel while these companies got too big?
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  It's really about doing what she says the regulators had not done for decades, which
*  is get ahead of tech companies and basically beat them to the future.
*  And does she win?
*  She does not.
*  Metta closes this deal.
*  They declare victory.
*  And it's a difficult moment because this is the first tech case that had really been developed
*  totally under Lina Khan.
*  So the FTC suffers a loss, but the agency doesn't stop there.
*  And what's the next case they go for?
*  So even before they lost in the Metta case, they had sued to stop Microsoft from buying
*  video game publisher Activision Blizzard.
*  And basically they're arguing that Microsoft will use the popular Activision games, namely
*  this Call of Duty series, which just to give people a sense of scale here has made like
*  $30 billion over the lifetime of the franchise.
*  In 2019, Activision said that Call of Duty had earned more than the Marvel Cinematic
*  Universe.
*  So these are big games.
*  And the FTC is saying that basically Microsoft will withhold those games, these like blockbuster
*  from the companies that compete with Xbox, the console itself, the physical platform
*  that runs the game.
*  Basically they're saying they're going to withhold them from Sony, which makes the PlayStation.
*  And the FTC says Microsoft could also use this kind of new leverage through the deal
*  to dominate cloud gaming, which is a nascent market for streaming games over the web.
*  So the FTC's argument here is that there's a potential future where Microsoft owns not
*  just one of the biggest gaming consoles in the world, the Xbox, but also one of the biggest
*  games in the world, Call of Duty, which could limit access to that game from other consoles.
*  Exactly.
*  And in turn, the FTC is arguing lore gamers over to Xbox.
*  And the FTC says that Microsoft has done this before.
*  They've bought a studio and then made that studios games Xbox exclusives.
*  But in this case, Microsoft fights back hard and they say, we promise we won't do this.
*  And we're willing to basically ink contracts with other video game console makers that
*  guarantee that we will provide Call of Duty to them for a certain period of time.
*  They do strike in some form one of these deals with Nintendo.
*  They say that they have made a similar offer to Sony, but Sony hasn't accepted.
*  And so they basically say this concern you have, we can alleviate it without ever going
*  to court.
*  But Lina Khan doesn't believe them.
*  Exactly.
*  From her perspective, all of this basically leads to a less competitive marketplace.
*  So what are the chances, David, that she wins this case?
*  So it's a tough case.
*  Antitrust regulators have not brought a ton of cases in recent years in which you're dealing
*  with two companies that are merging or one company is being acquired where they don't
*  totally directly compete.
*  It's more common for them to challenge a deal like say, this is a total hypothetical, but
*  two meatpackers who are merging into one meatpacker.
*  And so in that sense, the case potentially could be difficult.
*  OK, so she went after Facebook.
*  She went after Microsoft.
*  What about Amazon, the company that has been the focus of so much of her work prior to
*  coming to the FTC?
*  Well, and that was for the first 18 months of her tenure, the big question for those
*  of us who track this every day.
*  It's like, when is the Amazon case going to come?
*  Is it going to come at all?
*  The FTC actually has two sets of powers.
*  They can bring these antitrust cases that argue that there's some problem with competition
*  in the market.
*  They also are in charge of stopping companies from doing things that they say are unfair
*  or deceptive.
*  So like think about a scam or a violation of your privacy.
*  And last week, they did take Amazon to court.
*  They argued in a pretty sweeping complaint that Amazon had tricked customers through
*  using basically deceptive designs into signing up without total informed consent for their
*  Prime subscription service.
*  And they say basically that these customers have been duped into signing up for Prime
*  and that then when you went to cancel Prime, it was like this maze to cancel.
*  They would bombard you with offers saying, well, no, stay, stay, stay.
*  And it was like a ton of screens you had to get through if you wanted to cancel.
*  I feel like I've been there, actually, having lived in different countries and signing up
*  to different Prime accounts and trying to get out of them was not always easy, shall
*  we say.
*  Yeah.
*  And these are not uncommon, right, across the Internet.
*  And critics of these practices call them dark patterns, that they're basically like trickster
*  design tactics that are meant to make your brain do something without totally understanding
*  what it's doing.
*  And the FTC had promised they would go after these dark patterns.
*  And they bring this case that argues that Amazon has used these tricky tactics to pull
*  consumers in to this really core part of its business in the form of the Prime subscription.
*  And what's the likelihood that she wins this case?
*  You know, it's a little up in the air.
*  Amazon has signaled that they're going to fight this aggressively.
*  They said in response to the lawsuit that in fact, things are designed to be, you know,
*  easy to navigate and they're not going down without a fight.
*  But it leaves the broader question unanswered, which is, is she going to bring a case against
*  Amazon that is really about Amazon's effect on competition in the market, an actual antitrust
*  case against the company?
*  Because the case that they just filed, while it's about a service that's very popular and
*  deals with some sort of novel and interesting issues, it's not her paper turned in to a
*  case.
*  So it seems, David, from everything you've laid out so far, that Lina Khan has taken
*  on three very difficult cases.
*  None of them is a slam dunk.
*  Is it fair to say that her approach is not really going the way she thought it would?
*  Well, that's where it gets a little interesting.
*  So the FTC isn't setting out to lose cases.
*  But Lina Khan and her allies believe that in order to win in the long term by shifting
*  the law back in this direction that they think, you know, harkens back to kind of the golden
*  year of trust busting in America, that you have to be willing to lose, that you have
*  to be willing to bring risky cases, kind of take big swings and know that not all of them
*  will pan out.
*  Some of them might be losses that trigger Congress to act.
*  In other cases, they might just be losses.
*  But you have to be willing to take those risks to shift the law back in a long term sense.
*  It's interesting.
*  It looks like she's taken an approach that, you know, doesn't really make me think of
*  lawyers.
*  It makes me think almost more of activists.
*  I mean, she's basically signaling, we are paying attention to you and we will come after
*  you.
*  It's almost like it's a deterrent to companies.
*  I think that Lina Khan and her counterpart at the Department of Justice absolutely are
*  sending a message to industry that in their mind, the cop is back on the beat, that they
*  should think twice before they do deals that might raise concerns.
*  But I think that Lina Khan and her allies look back to the 1970s when, in their view,
*  conservatives really successfully shifted the law in a direction that narrowed it and
*  in the view of Lina Khan, damaged the law and made it a less useful tool.
*  That that was a process that took a long time.
*  So I think that she is trying to precipitate a similar shift in the other direction while
*  still bringing a level of legal scrutiny to bear.
*  They're not filing cases that they know they're going to lose, but they are willing to lose
*  cases in order to win in the long term.
*  I guess one question is, can you play the long game when you're a political appointee
*  and your time in office is limited?
*  So that is the tension at the heart of Lina Khan's effort and the efforts by her allies.
*  It's possible President Biden will not be reelected.
*  Can they precipitate the kind of changes they want in a short period of time, or will they
*  leave behind cases and legal challenges that are continuing on without them there to fight
*  them?
*  But isn't there another scenario here where Lina Khan succeeds and there's risk there
*  too?
*  As customers, we love Amazon because our books and our toothpaste show up the next day.
*  So if Lina Khan does anything that changes that, is there a chance that the very people
*  she's trying to protect from market power will actually be very unhappy with her and
*  the FTC?
*  Well, that's what the companies say will happen.
*  That moves like the kind that Lina Khan is making will just make the internet a worse
*  experience for consumers.
*  And increasingly, there's been pushback against Lina Khan from other companies across the
*  economy.
*  The Chamber of Commerce, part of the biggest and most prominent business lobby in America,
*  has been extremely aggressive in attacking her policies.
*  And the truth is, sometimes it takes a long time to tell whether or not antitrust policy
*  has worked.
*  People argue that earlier antitrust cases paved the way for companies like Google to
*  start in the first place.
*  But that, again, is a long-term view.
*  What's clear right now is that this is one of the greatest battles in recent memory over
*  how corporate power is regulated in America, and Lina Khan and her allies are right at
*  the center of it.
*  David, thank you so much.
*  Thank you.
*  Did we all stay awake?
*  Yes, we're all awake.
*  We're awake.
*  We're with you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Thick smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed large parts of the United States on Wednesday,
*  moving from the east to the upper Midwest.
*  Several major cities, including Detroit and Indianapolis, recorded some of the worst air
*  quality in the country.
*  The smoke is the result of one of Canada's worst wildfire seasons in decades, and it's
*  expected to drift east.
*  Officials in several cities, including New York, have warned of worsening conditions
*  in the coming days.
*  And, according to U.S. officials, a senior Russian general had advanced knowledge of
*  Yevgeny Prigozhin's plans to rebel against Russia's military leadership, which has prompted
*  questions about what support the rebels had inside of Russia's governing elite.
*  The officials said they're trying to learn if General Sergei Surovikin, Russia's former
*  top commander in Ukraine, helped plan the rebellion, which posed the most dramatic threat
*  to President Vladimir Putin in his 23 years in power.
