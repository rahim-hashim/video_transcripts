*  From the New York Times, I'm Catherine Benholt. This is The Daily.
*  This week, in a San Francisco courtroom, federal regulators are fighting to block one of
*  the biggest deals in the history of Silicon Valley. Today, my colleague, David McCabe,
*  on the architect of that lawsuit, Lena Khan, and the growing campaign by the Biden administration
*  to finally reign in Big Tech.
*  It's Thursday, June 29th.
*  David, this is only the second episode I've hosted of The Daily, and I think it is the
*  first the show has ever devoted to the Federal Trade Commission. That may be because, frankly,
*  even saying those words just made me a little sleepy. Tell me why I shouldn't be sleepy.
*  You shouldn't be sleepy because the Federal Trade Commission is the regulator that is tasked
*  with making sure that capitalism works in the United States. The cases that they bring are
*  bellwethers for how big companies end up getting regulated and how powerful they are able to become.
*  One of those cases is playing out this week. That makes a lot of sense, and that has
*  broken me up. Good. Okay, so tell me about this case.
*  We're going to start with one of the biggest deals of the decade. Microsoft's long-running
*  $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
*  So the Federal Trade Commission is trying to stop Microsoft, which makes the Xbox video game
*  console, along with being involved in a ton of other businesses, from buying Activision Blizzard,
*  which publishes some of the biggest video games in the world.
*  Including Activision's first-person shooter, Cole of Juicy.
*  Probably most importantly, the Call of Duty franchise.
*  And one of the most popular mobile games, Candy Crush.
*  And right now in San Francisco, a judge is deciding whether or not the FTC's case is good enough
*  that they should temporarily block this deal from closing so that this big challenge to this acquisition
*  can go forward.
*  After all, while it was pitched as an acquisition, in some ways, it's more of a merger between
*  two of the five biggest gaming companies globally.
*  And this case is actually important in a bigger way, which is that it's a key indicator
*  for whether or not government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission can stop big tech
*  from getting bigger.
*  So explain that.
*  How do you mean?
*  So over the last five or so years, there's been really mounting concern, not just in Washington,
*  but in world capitals like Brussels and London, over how big Silicon Valley companies have gotten.
*  And we're talking really here about five companies.
*  Amazon, Google, Apple, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram and Microsoft.
*  And the critics of these companies believe that they've become these kind of insurmountable gatekeepers
*  for commerce and communications and basically like our whole lives online.
*  And governments have responded by saying there's a problem here, but now the question is,
*  can anybody actually take action to rein these companies in?
*  Or will they just get more powerful?
*  And it seems to be one of those rare issues where you actually have support on both sides of the aisle
*  where you kind of have mainstream figures, you know, from Bernie Sanders to Joe Biden and
*  just Holly, all of whom sort of agree, something needs to be done to regulate big tech.
*  That's right. It's the rare bipartisan consensus in Washington right now that these companies
*  have gotten really big and really powerful and the government maybe should do something about it.
*  But Congress in particular has really struggled to figure out what that is.
*  They propose a lot of laws and they haven't gone anywhere.
*  And so when Congress can't make new laws to regulate the tech giants, it means the only tool
*  that the government has to pursue these companies is to laws on the books.
*  And that means that the questions about are these companies too powerful and what should the
*  government do have really fallen to regulators like the Federal Trade Commission?
*  And that agency has started to take on these tech giants in a way that it hasn't before.
*  And the architect and face of that pivot is the FTC's new chair, Lena Khan.
*  Okay, so tell me about Lena Khan.
*  So Lena Khan has had a meteoric rise to lead the Federal Trade Commission.
*  And it all really starts in 2017.
*  Yeah, I'm Lena Khan. I'm a visiting fellow at Yale Law School.
*  So in 2017, not that long ago, Lena Khan was a lost student and she was at Yale Law School.
*  I wrote a piece called Amazon's Antitrust Paradox that tells the story of Amazon's rise.
*  She writes this essay for the law review as a lot of law students do, right?
*  About Amazon.
*  I think increasingly businesses are not able to compete on the merits with Amazon.
*  And actually, the way that she describes it in the paper is really instructive of how she
*  views the company and these tech platforms. So she writes in addition to being a retailer,
*  Amazon is now a marketing platform, a delivery and logistics network, a payment service,
*  a credit lender, an auction house, a major book publisher, a producer of television and films,
*  a fashion designer, a hardware manufacturer, and a leading host of cloud service space.
*  Wow. I mean, we all know how huge Amazon is in our lives. But it's quite startling to hear
*  this list of things that it does. One company that spans so many industries and roles,
*  basically sells things, competes against other selling things, and owns the platform where all
*  of these transactions happen as well.
*  That's right. And this idea of a platform business is really crucial to understanding
*  Lena Kahn's concerns. Because it's not just Amazon. Amazon is a clear example of it.
*  But Apple runs a platform in the form of its app store, right? Apple sells apps. They also run
*  the main store where other people sell apps. Google runs a search engine that includes results
*  from websites like, say, reviews of a restaurant. Google also has its own review service.
*  So what she's articulating is that these sort of mega platforms have grown without a lot of attention
*  from government and are posing real problems for competition in the economy.
*  So David, what is the solution she proposes in this paper?
*  So this is where we go back to the past a little bit.
*  Lena Kahn is telling a story about history. Antitrust also passed around the turn of the century
*  at a time when there were these big trusts, the most classic way to standard oil, which made
*  the Rockefeller family rich. And over time, they were used to break up standard oil,
*  to break up other big companies. But the reality is that some of antitrust law is written down
*  in the laws. And some of antitrust law is about how judges interpret it. And what Lena Kahn is
*  saying is that in the 1970s, conservative lawyers, academics, economists were able to shift the way
*  antitrust laws understood by the courts. And that instead of considering a whole range of harms
*  to competition to the economy, that the courts were now basically considering, in most cases,
*  one factor to decide whether or not something violated an antitrust law. And that was whether or not
*  it hurt consumers, and particularly whether or not it hurt consumers in the form of higher prices.
*  So what you're saying is that since the 1970s, the definition of antitrust in a way was that
*  as long as prices remained low and consumers happy, regulators left big companies alone.
*  Yeah, for the most part. And so in this paper, Lena Kahn is basically saying that the government
*  and the courts should widen the scope of what falls under antitrust laws in a way that she would argue
*  basically returns it to the tool it once was in American history. That even though Amazon
*  keep its prices very low, that it's still engaging in all these practices that could harm
*  competition potentially to the detriment of people including other smaller companies who sell
*  on its platform. So price alone is no longer like a useful and valuable indicator for when to
*  apply antitrust practices. That's exactly what you're saying. So David, one way to think about this,
*  as I'm listening to you, is that even though antitrust laws were originally designed to prevent the
*  concentration of corporate power, ironically, it seems that in recent decades, it's almost like
*  they have favored market concentration by focusing so much on lower prices and consumer happiness.
*  And now Lena Kahn wants the FDC to return to that original emission.
*  That's right. That's how she sees the central failing of the government in the proceeding, you know,
*  30 years. That they essentially were asleep at the switch while these companies got extremely
*  big and extremely powerful. And ultimately, I think the case that Lena Kahn is making is that,
*  yes, consumers are one part of the broader world. But the government needs to think about the economy
*  more broadly than it needs to think about does concentration in the economy mean workers get paid
*  less? Does it mean that it's harder to start a startup that might come up with some sort of
*  genius innovative product? And that when you consider all of those things together,
*  that you have a healthier and more dynamic economy ultimately democracy.
*  And how do people react to a paper? So with the caveat that we're talking about a law review article,
*  it goes viral. Yeah, in a report for the Yale Law Journal, Lena Kahn writes that Amazon's
*  dominance may soon challenge current antitrust laws. She joins us now to explain why.
*  And Lena Kahn, who again is in her 20s at this time, has just finished up law school, is suddenly
*  subject to a ton of media attention. This woman's name is Lena Kahn. She's kind of rising to
*  prominence among the antitrust circles down in DC. She wrote a big paper for the Yale Laws.
*  And suddenly, she's kind of a celebrity. She's profiled in the New York Times by my colleague,
*  David Strytefeld. And she's also providing the Atlantic in the Washington Post.
*  There was a piece out of Yale Law School that I sent around as well. It would be a different approach
*  to antitrust doctrine to make it clear. And part of what this article triggers is a big debate
*  about whether or not Lena Kahn is right or coming in with basically an attack on
*  thickness for thicknesses sake that actually won't be good for consumers. We have a society that says
*  consumers come first, vassers come second, and workers come third. And I think we're beginning
*  to question that rubric. And she becomes a face of what is now kind of a ballooning movement
*  of people who think that these big tech companies have gotten too big.
*  My argument is that Amazon is challenging the current paradigm in antitrust,
*  which primarily looks at consumer prices as a metric for whether markets are impeditive.
*  And suddenly, all of these people are paying attention to this argument that the regulators
*  were tasked with reigning in American corporations have failed to do so.
*  And what happens to Lena Kahn after she graduates from law school?
*  So she goes into government. She ends up working briefly for the FTC as an aid to a progressive
*  commissioner. Then she goes to Congress and she's a staff member on this big investigation that
*  Congress did into the power of the tech platforms. And then she becomes a law professor at
*  Columbia. But then Joe Biden gets elected president. And in 2021, he's staffing up his
*  administration. And he names her as one of the five commissioners on the federal trade commission.
*  And an important thing to understand about the FTC is that there are five commissioners who vote
*  on whether or not they'll take actions against companies. And then one of them is the chair.
*  And that person is the one who really decides the direction of the agency. So she's been named
*  one of those five commissioners, but not the chair. And so this is on its own a big win for the
*  antitrust reformer. She's this young rising star. And now here she is in a position of real
*  influence. And her nomination is approved by the Senate 69 to 28. So she gets some Republican
*  support. And then that same day hours hours after the Senate vote, Biden surprises everyone by
*  announcing that she will in fact be named chair of the whole agency. It's fascinating. So just a few
*  years after Lena can't publish her paper criticizing Amazon in the Yale Law Review as a kind of
*  unknown law student, not even graduated yet. She is appointed to the FTC, the government body that
*  is tasked with actually regulating companies like Amazon. That's right. She's 32 years old and the
*  most influential person at the federal trade commission. And in fact, Joe Biden also names other
*  big antitrust reformers to key positions in the government. So now this movement that you know,
*  five years earlier was largely producing scholarly and journalistic work about what they saw as
*  this big problem are in the sea of power in the agencies that can actually do something about it.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David at 32 years old Lena Khan who has not been shy about her ambition of going after big tech
*  is now the head of the FTC. So what does she do when she gets there?
*  Well, before she does anything, it won't shock you to hear that her appointment attracts the attention
*  of the companies she has been criticizing. So both Amazon and Facebook within about a month of
*  her being named chair asked that she be recused from any investigations into the companies.
*  They sound scared. Well, they've certainly noticed that she's in charge now and ultimately
*  she has so far opted not to recuse from either matter. So pretty soon, it becomes clear that
*  Lena Khan is interested in running a more aggressive FTC and takes a while to build these cases.
*  But of course, the big question is still what is she going to do about the big tech platforms,
*  the ones that she had highlighted in her paper. And we get the first hint towards the end of 2021
*  when meta decides that it's going to buy a virtual reality startup called within. Now, Meadow,
*  which on Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp, in recent years has been trying to make this pivot to
*  what they call the metaverse. This is like a virtual reality world or an augmented reality world
*  where people hang out, they go to work, you know, you and I record this podcast in virtual reality.
*  And it's a big part of their strategy. And they produce virtual reality headsets as part of this.
*  And so they buy this company that makes a virtual reality fitness game. It's a way to exercise,
*  you know, with one of these headsets on. And these companies, the big tech companies,
*  recently have acquired a lot of startups. And this deal is reported to be around $400 million,
*  which I've been in business journalism maybe too long, anything under a billion dollars.
*  People think of it as small, certainly like not a blockbuster deal, right? This is a big company
*  buying a small company. The small company gets paid out, the big company gets the virtual reality
*  fitness game. And on top of that, we're talking about virtual reality. It is a really decent technology,
*  right? It's not proliferated throughout offices and schools as some people think maybe it will.
*  But in July of 2022, the FTC sues to block this deal.
*  So how does Lena can see this case? Why is she pursuing this particular case?
*  So even though the actual number of value on the deal isn't that high, she says that by acquiring
*  this company, Meta is going to be able to try and dominate basically going forward. This young market
*  for virtual reality. And remember how like part of the concerns that she has are that the
*  regulator for basically asleep at the wheel while these companies got too big? Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah, it's really about doing what she says the regulators had not done for decades,
*  which is get ahead of tech companies and basically beat them to the future.
*  And does she win? She does not. Meta closes this deal, they declare victory. And it's a difficult
*  moment because this is the first tech case that had really been developed totally under Lena Conn.
*  So the FTC suffers a loss, but the agency doesn't stop there. And what's the next case they go for?
*  So even before they'd lost in the Meta case, they had sued to stop Microsoft from buying this
*  video game publisher Activision Blizzard. And basically they're arguing that Microsoft will use the
*  popular Activision games, namely this Call of Duty series, which just to give people a sense of
*  scale here has made like $30 billion over the lifetime of the franchise. In 2019, Activision said
*  that Call of Duty had earned more than the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So these are big games.
*  And the FTC is saying that basically Microsoft will withhold those games, these like blockbuster
*  titles from the companies that compete with Xbox, the console itself, the physical platform that runs
*  the game. Basically they're saying they're going to withhold them from Sony, which makes a PlayStation.
*  And the FTC says Microsoft could also use this kind of new leverage through the deal
*  to dominate cloud gaming, which is a nascent market for streaming games over the web.
*  So the FTC's argument here is that there's a potential future where Microsoft owns not just one of
*  the biggest gaming consoles in the world, the Xbox, but also one of the biggest games in the world,
*  Call of Duty, which could limit access to that game from other consoles.
*  Exactly. And in turn, the FTC is arguing lower gamers, right, over to Xbox. And the FTC says
*  that Microsoft has done this before. They've bought a studio and then made that studio's games,
*  Xbox exclusives. But in this case, Microsoft fights back hard and they say, we promise we won't
*  do this and we're willing to basically in contracts with other video game console makers,
*  the guarantee that we will provide Call of Duty to them for a certain period of time. They do
*  strike in some form one of these deals with Nintendo. They say that they have made a similar offer
*  to Sony, but Sony hasn't accepted. And so they basically say this concern you have, we can
*  alleviate it without ever going to court. But Lena can't doesn't believe them. Exactly. And from her
*  perspective, all of this basically leads to a less competitive marketplace. So what are the
*  chances, David, that she wins this case? So it's a tough case. Any trust regulators have not
*  brought a ton of cases in recent years in which you're dealing with two companies that are merging,
*  or one company's being acquired where they don't totally directly compete. It's more common
*  for them to challenge a deal like say, this is a total hypothetical, but two meatpackers
*  who are merging into one meatpacker, right? And so in that sense, the case potentially could be
*  difficult. Okay. So she went after Facebook, she went after Microsoft, what about Amazon, the
*  company that has been the focus of so much of her work prior to coming to the FTC? Well, and that
*  was for the first 18 months of her tenure, the big question for those of us who track this every day.
*  It's like, when is the Amazon case going to come? Is it going to come at all? And the FTC actually
*  has two sets of powers. They can bring these antitrust cases that argue that there's some
*  problem with competition in the market. They also are in charge of stopping companies from doing
*  things that they say are unfair or deceptive. So like think about a scam or a violation of your
*  privacy. And last week, they did take Amazon to court. They argued in a pretty sweeping complaint
*  that Amazon had tricked customers through using basically deceptive designs into signing up
*  total informed consent for their Prime subscription service. And they say basically that these
*  customers have been duped into signing up for Prime. And then when you went to cancel Prime,
*  it was like this maze to cancel it. They would bombard you with offers saying, well, no, stay,
*  stay, stay. And it was like a ton of screens you had to get through if you wanted to cancel it.
*  I feel like I've been there actually. I haven't lived in different countries and signing up to
*  different Prime accounts and trying to get out of them. It was not always easy, shall we say?
*  Yeah. And these are not uncommon right across the internet. And critics of these practices
*  call them dark patterns that they're basically like trickster design tactics that are meant to
*  make your brain do something about totally understanding what it's doing. And the FTC
*  had promised they would go after these dark patterns and they bring this case that argues that
*  Amazon has used these tricky tactics to pull consumers in to this really core part of its business
*  in the form of the Prime subscription. And what's the likelihood that you wins this case?
*  You know, it's a little up in the air. And Amazon has signaled that they're going to fight this
*  aggressively. They said in response to the lawsuit that in fact things are designed to be easy
*  to navigate. And they're not going down without a fight. But it leaves the broader question
*  on answered, which is is she going to bring a case against Amazon that is really about Amazon's
*  effect on competition in the market, an actual antitrust case against the company. Because the
*  case that they just filed while it's about a service that's very popular and deals with some sort
*  of novel and interesting issues, it's not her paper turned into a case.
*  So it seems David, from everything you've laid out so far that Lena Khan has taken on three
*  very difficult cases. None of them is a slam dunk. Is it fair to say that her approach is not
*  really going the way she thought it would? Well, that's where it gets a little interesting. So
*  the FTC isn't setting out to lose cases. But Lena Khan and her allies believe that in order to
*  win in the long term by shifting the law back in this direction that they think, you know,
*  Harkins back to kind of the golden era of trust busting in America, that you have to be willing to
*  lose. That you have to be willing to bring risky cases, kind of take big swings and know that not
*  all of them will pan out. Some of them might be losses that trigger Congress to act. In other
*  cases, they might just be losses. But you have to be willing to take those risks to shift the law
*  back in a long term sense. It's interesting. It looks like she's taken approach that, you know,
*  doesn't really make me think of lawyers. It makes me think almost more of activists. I mean, she's
*  basically signaling we are paying attention to you and we will come after you. It's almost like
*  it's a deterrent to companies. I think that Lena Khan and her counterpart at the Department of Justice
*  absolutely are sending a message, right, to industry that in their mind, the cop is back on the
*  V that they should think twice before they do deals that might raise concerns. But I think that
*  Lena Khan and her allies look back to the 1970s when in their view, these conservatives really
*  successfully shifted the law in a direction that narrowed it and in the view of Lena Khan damaged
*  the law and made it a less useful tool that that was a process that took a long time.
*  So I think that she is trying to precipitate a similar shift in the other direction
*  while still bringing a level of legal scrutiny to bear. They're not filing cases that they know
*  they're going to lose, but they are willing to lose cases in order to win in the long term.
*  I guess one question is, can you play the long game when you're a political appointee
*  and your time in office is limited? So that is the tension at the heart of
*  Lena Khan's effort in the efforts by her allies. It's possible President Biden will not be
*  reelected. Can they precipitate the kind of changes they want in a short period of time,
*  or will they leave behind cases and legal challenges that are continuing on without them there to
*  fight them? But isn't there another scenario here where Lena Khan succeeds and there's risk there too?
*  As customers, we love Amazon because our books and our toothpaste are of the next day.
*  So if Lena Khan does anything that changes that, is there a chance that the very people she's
*  trying to protect from market power will actually be very unhappy with her and the FTC?
*  Well, that's what the company say will happen that moves like the kind that Lena Khan is making.
*  We'll just make the internet a worse experience for consumers. And increasingly,
*  there's been pushback against Lena Khan from other companies across the economy. The Chamber
*  of Commerce, probably the biggest and most prominent business lobby in America has been extremely
*  aggressive in attacking her policies. And the truth is, sometimes it takes a long time to tell
*  whether or not antitrust policy has worked. People argue that earlier antitrust cases paves the way
*  for companies like Google to start in the first place. But that again is a long-term view.
*  What's clear right now is that this is one of the greatest battles in recent memory over how
*  corporate power is regulated in America and Lena Khan and her allies are right at the center of it.
*  David, thank you so much. Thank you. Did we all stay awake?
*  Yes, we're all awake. We're with you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Fix smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed large parts of the United States on Wednesday,
*  moving from the east to the upper Midwest.
*  Several major cities, including Detroit and Indianapolis, recorded some of the worst
*  air quality in the country. The smoke is the result of one of Canada's worst wildfire seasons
*  and decades, and it's expected to drift east. Officials in several cities, including New York,
*  have warned of worsening conditions in the coming days.
*  And, according to US officials, a senior Russian general had advanced knowledge of
*  the Afghani pre-Gojans plans to rebel against Russia's military leadership,
*  which has prompted questions about what support the rebels had inside of Russia's governing elite.
*  The officials said they're trying to learn if General Sergei Serovikin, Russia's former top
*  commander in Ukraine, helped plan the rebellion, which pulls the most dramatic threat to President
*  Vladimir Putin in his 23 years in power. Today's episode was produced by Mouge Zadie,
