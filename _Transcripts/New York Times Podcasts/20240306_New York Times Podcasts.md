# The Unhappy Voters Who Could Swing the Election
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyFgxrkK7bI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Millions of voters in states across the country cast their ballots in the presidential primary
*  on Super Tuesday, leaving little doubt that the November election will be a rematch between
*  Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
*  But in a race that's increasingly inevitable, a New York Times Sienna College poll shows
*  there's a critical group of voters that are making the outcome of that race anything but.
*  Today, my colleague Nate Cohn on who those voters are and why they represent a particular
*  threat to Joe Biden.
*  It's Wednesday, March 6th.
*  Nate!
*  Hello, hello.
*  How are you?
*  Hello, hello.
*  How's it going?
*  It's going well.
*  How are you?
*  Good.
*  It's a little rainy.
*  My feet are sopping wet.
*  I did the subway.
*  So did I.
*  I'm going to shut the door here.
*  So Nate, Super Tuesday has just happened, which means, of course, more than a dozen
*  states have voted in their primaries, and President Biden and former President Trump
*  continue to sail to their respective nominations.
*  I mean, at this point, there is really no suspense at all, barring something extremely
*  unexpected, whether they will be the nominees in the general election.
*  That's right.
*  Nearly half of all the delegates at stake have been awarded, and Biden and Trump have
*  won nearly all of them.
*  So they are right now just on the cusp of winning a majority of the delegates and securing
*  the nomination, and they'll do that over the next week or two.
*  Okay.
*  So to that point, the New York Times just released a poll about how people are feeling
*  about that inevitable matchup.
*  And that's what we want to talk with you about today, Nate.
*  We want the results, because frankly, they're not all that surprising, but instead, this
*  poll that gets at how voters are actually thinking about their choices in this election.
*  So tell me about this poll.
*  The top line result is that voters are not happy about this upcoming election.
*  When we ask them an open-ended question, they say that they're frustrated, they're disappointed,
*  that they're anxious, they're scared, they offer negative or at least uncertain feelings
*  about the election.
*  That's in no small part because they don't like either of the candidates.
*  They don't have a favorable view of either Joe Biden or Donald Trump.
*  But when we ask them to choose how they would vote if the election were held today, Trump
*  is firmly in the lead.
*  He's up by five points among registered voters and four points among those who we think are
*  likeliest to vote.
*  And that's the largest lead, by the way, that Trump has ever had in a Times-Sienna or Times-CBS
*  poll.
*  And it's really one of the largest leads that a Republican presidential candidate has had
*  period over the last 20 years since George W. Bush led John Kerry.
*  So this is pretty remarkable.
*  I mean, a peak for his entire career in politics, really one of the highest ever leads.
*  I mean, this is probably in Biden camp raising some real alarms.
*  You would think.
*  And it's worth noting it is not just our poll here.
*  All of the polls show Donald Trump leading in the critical battleground states worth
*  more than the 270 electoral votes he needs to win.
*  There were other polls this weekend that showed Trump in the lead, CBS, Fox News.
*  So there's a consensus at this point that Donald Trump has a lead and he's had it now
*  for four months, a sustained and clear advantage.
*  Okay, so voters aren't feeling too great about their options, but with the options that they
*  do have, they're leaning towards Trump in this moment by a pretty meaningful margin.
*  That's right.
*  And it's worth dwelling on why Trump has the lead and why that's related to this dissatisfaction.
*  When we polled voters four years ago, a majority of voters said they had a favorable view of
*  Joe Biden and a majority of voters said they had an unfavorable view of Donald Trump.
*  Four years later, Donald Trump's numbers are almost exactly the same.
*  In our final poll in 2020, 54% said they had an unfavorable view of Donald Trump.
*  Today, 54% say they have an unfavorable view of Donald Trump.
*  So not much difference there.
*  But the top line result is completely different.
*  And that's because Joe Biden has gone from being a broadly acceptable, relatively well
*  liked figure, who four years ago, 52% of voters said they had a favorable view of, to a pretty
*  unpopular candidate who voters are very skeptical of.
*  Now 38% of voters have a favorable view of him.
*  His job approval rating is even less than that.
*  So big change in the Biden category.
*  Huge change.
*  It completely flips around the fundamental premise of the Biden campaign from 2020.
*  Last time, Joe Biden was the guy who was acceptable to enough people who disliked Donald Trump
*  that he could win.
*  That's why Democrats chose him over someone more controversial like Elizabeth Warren or
*  Bernie Sanders.
*  It's not true anymore.
*  Okay, so tell us about the voters who are driving this change, this dissatisfaction
*  with Biden.
*  The easiest way to think about it is that there's this group of voters who dislike both
*  candidates.
*  And this is a really important group that pollsters like to call the double haters.
*  Double haters.
*  Double haters.
*  They don't like either of them.
*  Twice the hate.
*  And they really have the potential to decide this election.
*  So give me a sense of who these voters are.
*  Well, the double haters are about 19% of the electorate in our poll.
*  And that's up from 5% in 2020.
*  So that's a big increase.
*  And last time they voted for Biden by a three to one margin.
*  And you know, they're a mixed bag.
*  When you call them up.
*  Hello?
*  Hello?
*  Wow, I really never expected a reporter to call.
*  They tell you all kinds of different things.
*  It's really the age.
*  One of the main things is just his age.
*  He's passed his prime.
*  He doesn't really know what's going on.
*  Many of them think Joe Biden is just too old to be an effective president.
*  I think Joe Biden is a lovely older gentleman that should resign at some point.
*  But other than that, economically, we've been in the dump.
*  Some of them say that they are deeply dissatisfied about the cost of living being 20% higher
*  than it was four years ago.
*  Don't make food more expensive.
*  We all buy it.
*  Very obvious.
*  And for people who have a grade level, I would probably give him a D minus.
*  And you can imagine different people, different archetypes of people who would have liked
*  Biden last time, but have soured on him now.
*  I mean, I'm horrified to think in this country, this is the best we can come up with for the
*  next four years to be a president.
*  You have a moderate voter who maybe reluctantly voted for Joe Biden in 2020 because they didn't
*  like Donald Trump, but Joe Biden is kind of like walked in and just has let this country
*  get overrun with all kinds of stuff happening.
*  Now just thinks that the administration has done a poor job at the border or on foreign
*  policy or spent too much money and hasn't reigned in the national debt.
*  I would probably consider myself a leftist leaning more towards the left.
*  Pretty progressive.
*  You can imagine a voter on the left continuing to back Israel in Gaza has been particularly
*  disappointing would be a very mild way to put it, who is frustrated by Biden's handling
*  of Gaza, also considering his policies are stuck decades in the past or thinks that the
*  administration has failed to be sufficiently progressive in its domestic agenda.
*  You know, I'm not very excited right now.
*  And what's particularly notable is that this group of double haters includes young voters,
*  black voters and Latino voters, the kinds of voters that Democrats usually count on
*  to win elections.
*  And in the end, this very diverse group of voters is pretty split on how they'll vote
*  in the next election.
*  Split how exactly?
*  How are these voters thinking about their vote in this moment?
*  I mean, they're double haters, as you say, so they don't love either candidate.
*  Do we have a sense of which way they're leaning right now?
*  And when I said split, I meant that they are deeply unhappy with their choice.
*  And as a consequence, they are splitting in all kinds of ways.
*  I do plan on voting for Joe Biden unless somebody else magically comes to the forefront before
*  then.
*  Some of them say that they'll vote for Biden.
*  I have no other choice but to stick with them.
*  We're just being forced to pick essentially the lesser of two evils.
*  And some of them, I honestly don't think I'm going to vote, say they're simply not
*  going to vote.
*  There's no good outcome for others if we win.
*  So it doesn't matter.
*  In the general for the presidency, I will be voting for a third party this year.
*  Others say they'll vote for a minor party candidate.
*  My first time since I think the fourth grade when we got to do a mock ballot and I voted
*  for Nader.
*  I think it was the fourth grade.
*  I don't really I guess I'd have to really do some soul searching and try and figure
*  out who's going to do the least amount of damage.
*  Others, they just throw up their hands and say that they're undecided.
*  It would I could say it would probably take a lot of whine for me to figure out what I'm
*  going to do.
*  But I definitely leaning more towards Donald Trump.
*  And some of them will vote for Trump.
*  I'm just picking the least horrible alternative.
*  And I think that's Donald Trump this time around.
*  If you had told yourself back in 2020 that you'd vote for Trump in 2024, what do you
*  think your reaction would have been?
*  I it would have been like a slap in the face.
*  Wow. OK, so Biden might actually be driving these voters, voters who actually voted for
*  him in 2020 into the arms of Trump.
*  And even if some of these voters don't actually switch sides, they might just stay home, as
*  you say, or vote third party, which would also be pretty damaging for Biden.
*  That's right. And it's worth remembering that the last election was pretty close.
*  Joe Biden only won the critical battleground states by less than a percentage point in
*  those cases. So he does not have room to bleed a huge chunk of his support among young
*  black and Latino voters.
*  And the critical question for this election is whether these voters remain this dissatisfied
*  with Joe Biden eight months from now.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Nate, from everything you've said, this election could really come down to these
*  voters who are legitimately torn over what to do.
*  I know it's early. We're eight months out and we know how these voters are leaning.
*  But do we have a sense of where they'll land come Election Day?
*  The short answer is no. I mean, there's a long way until the election.
*  But you know, try and at least get a sense of where this could head and to see the lay
*  of the land. You know, I like to look back at historical examples that feel somewhat
*  like this moment. And oddly enough, I think the example that comes to my mind isn't 2020,
*  even though this is a rematch, but 2016, the election between Trump and Clinton.
*  OK, so tell me about 2016.
*  What is it about that election that feels analogous to you?
*  The thing that is most analogous is that 2016 also featured a large number of these
*  double haters, voters who didn't like either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.
*  In fact, there were more double haters in that election.
*  Really?
*  Than in this one. And there's a lot about the way that race played out that already
*  feels reminiscent of the polling today.
*  One obvious example is the large number of people who are flirting with third party
*  candidates. Back in 2016, Gary Johnson actually peaked around 10 percent of the vote.
*  It's a little bit like how Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
*  is routinely polling around 10 percent of the vote in the polls that are asking about him
*  at this point. And there were also in that election a large number of traditionally
*  Democratic and Republican voters who were not behaving like traditionally Democratic
*  and Republican voters in the polls when they were being given this choice they didn't
*  want to make.
*  How do you mean?
*  There were a lot of blue collar Democrats, for instance, who were deeply frustrated with
*  Hillary Clinton's position on free trade or on immigration and who were actually a little
*  bit tempted by some of what Donald Trump had to offer on those issues.
*  Right. We remember them well.
*  We do.
*  Working class whites.
*  And on the other hand, there were also a lot of highly educated Republicans who didn't
*  like Donald Trump. That was partly on the issues, right, because of his stances on immigration
*  or opposition to entitlement cuts. It was also, though, because of his conduct.
*  He routinely said things that were considered inappropriate or even offensive.
*  And that repelled a lot of traditionally Republican voters as well.
*  And so the polls showed a large number of voters who were traditionally Republican or
*  traditionally Democrat, who were frustrated by both candidates and were either undecided,
*  considering doing something shocking like voting for the other party or supporting a minor
*  party candidate in that election, Gary Johnson.
*  Interesting. So in the way that Biden is struggling with his traditional coalition in 2024,
*  we saw both Clinton and Trump having that same struggle in 2016.
*  Clinton, of course, with blue collar Democrats, Trump with some subset of traditional
*  Republicans, college grads, people like that.
*  Exactly. And it created a very volatile campaign.
*  And depending on what the news was at any given point, these undecided voters who were
*  conflicted between the two candidates could swing between the two sides very abruptly.
*  Because just depending on whether on any given day you were thinking about the thing that
*  upset you most about Hillary or Donald Trump, you could give a pollster a completely
*  different answer.
*  And Nate, what were some examples of those swings?
*  Well, you may remember that in the summer of 2016 that Jim Comey at once exonerated
*  Hillary Clinton on the email server front, but then in the same press conference,
*  scolded her conduct as inappropriate and negligent.
*  And there was actually a moment after that where Donald Trump surged into a very brief
*  lead around the Republican convention.
*  And then just a few weeks later, Donald Trump would do something offensive that would
*  blow it all up.
*  I remember, for instance, that at the Democratic convention, there was a Gold Star parent
*  who spoke on behalf of Hillary Clinton.
*  And Donald Trump spent a week going after the parent of a soldier who had died in
*  Afghanistan.
*  Right. It just seemed so shocking.
*  Exactly. Then Hillary Clinton would surge back into the lead.
*  And as a result of this, you know, sort of back and forth between good news and bad
*  news for these two deeply disliked candidates, the polls would swing as well.
*  And a wide range of possibilities became pretty evident.
*  And there was no way to know until the election which of those possibilities was where
*  the voters would land in the end.
*  So how might we see that kind of volatility play out this time around?
*  This time, most of the volatility is on the Biden side.
*  As we mentioned, Donald Trump's favorability ratings are pretty solid at this point.
*  Unlike in 2016, Republicans have mostly unified around him.
*  I'll point out, by the way, that the Haley vote is mostly voters who voted for Biden
*  in 2020.
*  Interesting. So almost all of this swing can happen on the Democratic side.
*  And here again, we have this wide range of possibilities, right?
*  If it's really true that young black Latino, also relatively moderate Haley voters
*  and so on, that this group of double haters is so negative on Joe Biden that they'll
*  vote for Donald Trump, Trump could win a decisive victory.
*  But on the other hand, if these voters are reminded of why they voted for Joe Biden
*  four years ago, reminded of the reasons they don't like Donald Trump, then you could
*  get a very different outcome.
*  You know, there's been a phenomenon that people have talked about called Trump
*  amnesia, where many voters have sort of forgotten about many of the things that led
*  them to dislike Donald Trump so much in the first place.
*  And it's worth remembering what 2016 or 2020 was like.
*  Right.
*  I mean, every week, Donald Trump did something that offended a new group of voters,
*  whether it was women or Latino voters, or his handling of the Black Lives Matter
*  movement. We haven't had anything like that this cycle.
*  Now, maybe that means that Donald Trump has become a more effective politician.
*  That's maybe that's what we'll learn.
*  Or maybe it's just a matter of time that once the campaign gets underway, once the
*  general election begins, that Donald Trump is going to be in the news more.
*  He's going to defend voters yet again.
*  And even if he doesn't, the Joe Biden campaign can hope to remind voters of the
*  reasons why they didn't like Donald Trump in the first place.
*  And it's entirely possible that if that plays out, that if voters are reminded of
*  the reasons they dislike Donald Trump as the electioneers, that this large group of
*  voters that voted for Joe Biden last time that dislikes him today will ultimately
*  return to a side because they dislike Donald Trump even more.
*  And presumably all of this could really lead to a lot of swinging back and forth
*  in the polls this time around, right?
*  It could. I mean, it depends on how the news plays out, right?
*  I mean, to the 2016 example, that volatility required a very volatile news cycle
*  that led voters to swing back and forth.
*  If Donald Trump comes into the news one week and says the most offensive thing
*  imaginable about Palestinians and Black and Latino voters, maybe Joe Biden can
*  surge and quickly re-consolidate these voters.
*  And then if the very next week, Joe Biden has, you know, a moment where he doesn't
*  look up to the job, then maybe those voters swing back, right?
*  That's the sort of case where you could see that volatility.
*  But even if you don't see that volatility in the polls, the underlying instability
*  of the preference of voters is still there.
*  These are, regardless of whether the polls swing, these are still voters
*  agonizing over a choice they don't want to make.
*  And that still creates the basis for the polls to swing, regardless of whether
*  they actually do.
*  Yeah.
*  So Nathan, what about the ultimate outcome?
*  I mean, what lessons can we take from 2016 that might show us what this could
*  look like in the final vote tally in November?
*  Well, I know on 2016 to, you know, seem like it's going to predict the outcome.
*  But, you know, in the end in 2016, many of the traditionally Republican voters who
*  dislike Donald Trump did return to his side.
*  They didn't want to vote for him.
*  They really didn't.
*  But in the end, when they got into the ballot box, they voted for him.
*  And they did so because they were Republican voters and they couldn't in the
*  end get around to voting for a Democrat they disliked like Hillary Clinton.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that for Joe Biden, that's a pretty favorable precedent.
*  You know, just to take one example from this poll, more than 10% of black
*  Democrats who voted for Joe Biden say they're going to vote for Donald Trump.
*  Wow.
*  Now, maybe they'll do that in the end.
*  Yeah.
*  But when they get into the ballot box, are voters like that really going to vote
*  for Donald Trump, as opposed to just saying it to a poll source eight months ago?
*  I don't know, but I know that in 2016, that that's exactly the kind of dynamic
*  that didn't hold on election day.
*  And those voters came back to Donald Trump.
*  At the end, they came back to their tribe, right?
*  They did.
*  It took all the way to the end, but they did it.
*  So to the extent that the polls today would lead someone to believe that Joe
*  Biden can't win, you know, I think that would be a mistake given the characteristics
*  of the voters who are currently giving Donald Trump the lead.
*  Got it.
*  So the potential bright spot here for Biden is that history tells us that these
*  voters do tend to come back to their party, but that it's not guaranteed, right?
*  It's a big if.
*  That's right.
*  And that's especially true when sort of the underlying political conditions ought
*  to be favorable to the candidate hoping to coalesce their own party support.
*  I mean, this is an election Joe Biden should win.
*  He's an incumbent president running for reelection and the economy is healthy enough.
*  Usually you win under those conditions.
*  And that's before considering that your opponent is accused of multiple federal crimes.
*  So the political science seminar would tell us this is a win for Biden.
*  Yeah.
*  If this was a test in some political science seminar class, you were given the
*  conditions we've got today and the nature of Joe Biden's opponent, you would say
*  Joe Biden should win this election.
*  And so you're hoping if you're the Biden campaign, that those underlying political
*  conditions mean that these voters are probably likelier than not to come back to
*  your side.
*  On the other hand, Biden's unusually weak.
*  He has the lowest approval ratings of any president seeking reelection at
*  this point in his term.
*  His age is an extremely unusual factor that might prove to just be disqualifying
*  for a certain share of voters.
*  Not exactly something he can do anything about.
*  Yeah.
*  So you have a president who has some of the lowest ratings on record, who faces a
*  problem that would be very difficult for him to address.
*  And we just don't know whether that is something that will prevent him from
*  capitalizing on what should be a favorable opportunity here.
*  We've never seen anything like this before.
*  So if I've learned nothing else from this conversation, Nate, it is that we are in
*  for a very volatile, very unpredictable election.
*  It could be very volatile and it's definitely difficult to predict.
*  Nate, thank you.
*  Sabrina, thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Tuesday, Senator Kirsten Sinema of Arizona said that she would not seek
*  reelection, ending more than a year of speculation about her political future.
*  Sinema has had a dramatic tenure in Washington, winning her seat as a Democrat,
*  but then switching her party affiliation to independent in 2022.
*  She supported some parts of President Biden's agenda, but Democratic activists
*  had criticized what they said was her eagerness to side with business interests
*  above progressive causes.
*  Her decision to bow out of the race now sets up a more traditional matchup between
*  the eventual Republican and Democratic nominees in a critical state that could
*  determine which party wins control of the Senate in November.
*  And President Biden said that talks on a possible six-week ceasefire and hostage
*  release deal between Israel and Hamas were, quote, in the hands of Hamas right now.
*  He said negotiators were racing to reach a deal before the Islamic Holy Month of
*  Ramadan, which begins this weekend, as a continued Israeli onslaught during the
*  holiday could further inflame Arab Israeli tensions.
*  But later on Tuesday, a senior Hamas leader speaking in Lebanon appeared to
*  reject the deal, insisting that Israeli hostages would be released only after a
*  more permanent ceasefire was in place and Israeli forces had withdrawn from Gaza.
