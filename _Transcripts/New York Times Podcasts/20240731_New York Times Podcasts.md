# An Escalating War in the Middle East
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm9e4ojicwc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Over the past few days, simmering tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese
*  militia on Israel's northern border, have reached a tipping point.
*  A loud explosion has been heard in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
*  Beirut's densely populated southern Dahya neighbourhood showered in debris following
*  a precision strike by Israeli fighter jets.
*  Israeli military says it has carried out a strike targeting the Hezbollah commander allegedly
*  behind Saturday's deadly attack in the Golan Heights.
*  Raising fresh fears of a wider war in the Middle East.
*  Today, my colleague Ben Hubbard on why these attacks are different and why getting them
*  to stop could be so tough.
*  It's Wednesday, July 31st.
*  So Ben, The Daily has been following the war in Gaza and the risk that it could spread
*  to the broader region.
*  And over the past few days, there have been this series of attacks on Israel's northern
*  border, the border with Lebanon.
*  And they really felt like a ratcheting up and potentially even a turning point.
*  So we're talking to you on Tuesday afternoon in New York, and we want to dig into what
*  happened.
*  Tell us what we know so far.
*  Well, it's after midnight here in the Middle East, and we're still reporting out exactly
*  what happened.
*  What we know is that Israel carried out an airstrike on a building in a southern suburb
*  of Beirut that targeted a senior military official in Hezbollah, part of the city where
*  Hezbollah basically runs the show.
*  They largely destroyed a building, and Israel has claimed that they succeeded in assassinating
*  a senior military leader in Hezbollah.
*  And this all comes in the context of this ongoing exchange of attacks across the Lebanese-Israeli
*  border that have been going on since near the start of the Gaza war.
*  While the focus has been mostly on Gaza, there's been the secondary battle taking place across
*  Israel's northern border.
*  This is between Israel, one of the most sophisticated militaries in the Middle East, and on the
*  Lebanese side, Hezbollah, which is an Iranian-backed militia that is probably one of the most powerful
*  non-state militias in the world.
*  This is a hostile border.
*  It's been hostile for decades.
*  But since the war in Gaza started in October, Hezbollah began striking targets inside of
*  Israel across the border.
*  Hezbollah said that it is a regional ally of Hamas and said that it wanted to basically
*  help Hamas out by trying to bog down Israeli forces in the north so that they couldn't
*  focus all of their energy on the south.
*  And this has continued to escalate.
*  There have been strikes on both sides.
*  There have been more than 150,000 people displaced from communities on both sides of the border.
*  There have been hundreds of people killed.
*  But all along, there's been this idea that both sides didn't want this to escalate into
*  another gigantic war.
*  But of course, the risk when you have two military powers striking each other on a daily
*  or sometimes hourly basis is that somebody is going to make a mistake.
*  Somebody is going to strike something that they shouldn't strike or carry out a strike
*  that kills too many civilians.
*  And that's going to kind of put the other side on the hook for retaliation.
*  And this is basically what everyone has been worried about for the last nine months.
*  And so all of a sudden, we seem to have reached that point where we're very much kind of on
*  the precipice of seeing whether this is really about to launch into a new level of conflagration.
*  Ben, where did this begin?
*  How did this new precipice you're talking about start?
*  So what we saw on Tuesday was an Israeli retaliation to a strike on Saturday that killed 12 teenagers
*  and children in an Israeli controlled town.
*  So tell us what happened on Saturday.
*  So just after 6 p.m. in a town called Majd al-Shamz, which is in the Golan Heights, this is territory
*  that Israel occupied in the 1967 war.
*  Many of the residents there are from the Arab Druze minority.
*  Many of them are not even Israeli citizens.
*  There are, you know, kids, teenagers out playing soccer.
*  Siren goes off.
*  And then within a few seconds, some sort of a rocket comes down, hits the edge of the
*  soccer pitch, and it all happened incredibly quickly.
*  And this was the deadliest attack inside of Israel since October 7th in terms of civilian
*  deaths.
*  Twelve people killed in one day, one attack.
*  And this has sent this sort of shockwave through Israel that how can we allow this to happen?
*  Tell me about the response to this, Ben.
*  Who claimed responsibility?
*  Well, earlier, Hezbollah had said that it was striking targets along the border.
*  There are military bases in the area that Hezbollah considers fair game in terms of
*  sort of the rules of this battle as it's taking place.
*  But as soon as it became apparent that this had killed civilians and especially civilian
*  children, Hezbollah very quickly issued an on-the-record denial saying we had absolutely
*  nothing to do with this, which is something that they don't usually do.
*  Israel said it was clear that this strike had come from Lebanon and they accused Hezbollah
*  of launching it.
*  And this was largely, they said, due to the kind of rocket that had been used and that
*  Hezbollah is the only force in Lebanon that has this kind of rocket.
*  The U.S.
*  Government has said that they support the Israeli findings.
*  So Hezbollah is denying it, but the U.S. and Israel say it's pretty conclusive it was their
*  rocket.
*  What happens?
*  Well, inside of Israel, there's very quickly a sense that there needs to be some kind of
*  a response.
*  And the fact that it is civilians and that it's children, there's just this sense that
*  Israel needs to do something that it needs to hit back.
*  And so for the last few days, everyone in the region has really been on tender hooks
*  waiting to see what is this response going to be?
*  How big is it going to be?
*  And then, of course, after that, what will Hezbollah's response be to that?
*  And that brings us to the strike in Beirut on Tuesday.
*  I'm curious about the calculations here for each side, you know, as we see things escalating.
*  Why don't you start with Hezbollah?
*  What's the thinking there?
*  Well, it certainly would not be unprecedented for these two powers to go to war.
*  They have a long history together that goes back to the 80s when Israel had occupied south
*  Lebanon and Hezbollah formed underground to try to push them out.
*  They attacked Israeli forces and effectively succeeded in getting them out by 2000.
*  Since then, Hezbollah has grown into something much, much more powerful than just an underground
*  military force.
*  Now they are a political party that has ministers in the Lebanese government.
*  They have members of parliament.
*  They work very closely with Iran.
*  They're sort of a linchpin of what is known as the Axis of Resistance, which is this group
*  of Iranian-backed militias around the region that consider it their job to push back against
*  Israel and to push back against the West.
*  And the last time that this really blew up was in 2006.
*  In 2006, Hezbollah launched a cross-border raid on some Israeli troops, ended up capturing
*  two of them and killing some others.
*  Israel responded with a tremendous attack on Lebanon.
*  Israel launched a ground invasion.
*  They bombed infrastructure across Lebanon, including bridges and the international airport.
*  And it was a very brutal 34-day war that basically ended with a standstill.
*  So I was actually covering this war for the Times in 2006.
*  And the thing that I really remember was, you know, the Israelis going in, kind of expecting
*  it to be easier than it was, but it wasn't, and leaving after a month of very intense
*  fighting.
*  And on the Lebanese side, there were these extreme casualties and, you know, most of
*  southern Lebanon had been flattened.
*  So very, very difficult, I think, for both sides in this conflict.
*  Yes, it was an incredibly destructive war.
*  There had been more than a thousand people killed in Lebanon, many of them Hezbollah
*  fighters, but also many, many civilians, more than 150 people killed in Israel.
*  And it was so destructive that Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, came out after the
*  war and effectively apologized, told the Lebanese that if I had known how destructive this was
*  going to be, we wouldn't have started it, which, as far as I'm aware, is probably the
*  only time that he's ever come out and apologized for anything, certainly for anything that
*  important.
*  Wow.
*  And I think the Israelis, too, realized that, you know, this was not a walk in the park.
*  They could not just go into Lebanon very easily and sort of destroy this threat on their northern
*  border.
*  You know, this was a very formidable foe that they were dealing with.
*  Okay, so both sides learned a very painful lesson in 2006, which is it can be quite difficult
*  to take on the other in an all out war.
*  What has happened since then?
*  Well, I think from that lesson, they realized that they also needed to prepare for the next
*  round.
*  So Hezbollah regrouped with help from Iran and other supporters.
*  It was able to build its military force, get more sophisticated weapons, more precise rockets.
*  During the civil war in Syria next door to Lebanon, which started in 2011, Hezbollah ended
*  up playing a very powerful role on the crown, supporting President Bashar al-Assad, went
*  in and sort of played a decisive role in a number of battles there, which killed a number
*  of Hezbollah people, but also gave kind of a whole new generation of younger fighters
*  on the ground experience with guerrilla warfare.
*  And so going into October 7th, Hezbollah was a much, much stronger force than it had ever
*  been in its history.
*  It had better weapons.
*  It had more fighters.
*  It was much more sophisticated.
*  It had new kinds of technology, including drones.
*  And then we see these capabilities when Hezbollah starts launching these attacks on northern
*  Israel.
*  Many of them are very precise and they target Israeli surveillance posts.
*  They target vehicles.
*  They do kill some civilians, but we've seen Hezbollah launching drones that go deep into
*  Israel and then they broadcast the footage of what they saw.
*  And Israel has responded to all this by striking Hezbollah harder and harder inside of Lebanon.
*  So we've seen repeated strikes that have assassinated a number of prominent Hezbollah leaders.
*  This is destructive for civilians living on both sides of the border.
*  There are somewhere around 60,000 Israelis who have fled northern Israel to go elsewhere
*  in the country.
*  In Lebanon, the number is even higher.
*  It's around somewhere close to 100,000 people who have left the south.
*  And there have been many people killed.
*  On the Lebanese side, there's more than 460 killed, probably around 100 of them civilians.
*  And in Israel, you have more than 20 military people who have been killed.
*  So the stakes really seem to be rising here.
*  What does Hezbollah, this now very well-armed, very disciplined group that's like kind of
*  partway between a militia and a country at this point, what does it say it wants?
*  Well their rallying cry, like that of their allies and Hamas and other groups around the
*  region is to destroy Israel.
*  But in terms of their more immediate objectives, at this point, they've gotten into this war
*  for very specific reasons that they made clear after they started in October.
*  And Hassan Nasrallah made it very clear early in the war what exactly Hezbollah set out
*  to do.
*  He said, we are not looking to get into a gigantic war with Israel, but we want to help
*  what he considers his brothers in Hamas and Gaza.
*  And they were going to do this by striking the Israeli military on the northern border
*  and trying to basically bog down part of Israel's forces.
*  And they basically want to keep the pressure on Israel and they have made it very clear
*  all along that the only thing that will stop them from striking these targets in northern
*  Israel is going to be the end of the war in Gaza.
*  But that's something that, given the politics and pressure inside of Israel, is proving
*  quite difficult for a number of reasons.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Ben, you've laid out Hezbollah's strategy of putting pressure on Israel, you know, trying
*  to get them to end the war in Gaza.
*  But what about Israel?
*  What are its considerations?
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in a pretty difficult spot when it comes to the
*  war in Gaza.
*  He promised at the start of this war that the two goals were to bring the hostages home
*  and to destroy Hamas.
*  And so far, Israel has really accomplished neither of these things.
*  And it's been nine months of incredibly, incredibly destructive warfare because they want to make
*  more progress in getting rid of Hamas and Gaza.
*  And they want to have some kind of something that looks like a victory and that ideally
*  would involve bringing home the remaining hostages.
*  On the other side, you have people who argue that, you know, the war has gone on long enough
*  and now it's time for some kind of a ceasefire.
*  So there have been repeated rounds of talks for some kind of a ceasefire with Hamas that
*  would involve the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian
*  prisoners from Israeli jails.
*  So far, Hamas hasn't agreed to any of the proposals that have been made.
*  So this is where we are in this position where we're just kind of stuck between these competing
*  pressures.
*  So the leaders of Hezbollah say only a ceasefire in Gaza will get them to stop firing.
*  But of course, the ceasefire in Gaza is, as you point out, quite stuck.
*  So it seems like Netanyahu's path to how he can respond here is actually pretty narrow.
*  Well he's also in a pickle when it comes to what to do about Lebanon.
*  He's once again dealing with competing pressures from inside of his own government and inside
*  of his own country.
*  He on one hand has these same right-wing ministers who are saying that the only solution to Hezbollah
*  is to basically reoccupy southern Lebanon.
*  And as recently as this Monday, Balazs Smotrich, the finance minister, said in a speech that
*  the only solution was to destroy Hezbollah, reoccupy southern Lebanon, and basically create
*  a kind of buffer zone on Lebanese territory inside of Lebanon.
*  And you've had other calls similar to this from other right-wing ministers.
*  And these are not fringe figures.
*  These are people who are essential to Benjamin Netanyahu in holding together his coalition.
*  They effectively have Netanyahu at their beck and call because if they leave the government,
*  it would collapse.
*  So what they say has a lot of weight in Israel right now.
*  It is very difficult for him to ignore what they're advocating for.
*  And at the same time, you have many people from the military establishment who are saying
*  at some point we will need to deal with Hezbollah, but now is not the time.
*  The forces are exhausted because of how long they've been fighting in Gaza and that Israel
*  is just not prepared to launch another gigantic war on its border.
*  So now, Ben, it looks like we have the beginning of an answer, right?
*  This attack in Beirut.
*  I guess I'm wondering what you, Ben, make of this attack on the escalation scale.
*  Is it ratcheting things up?
*  I think it's very hard this early on to gauge sort of where this falls on the scale, to
*  be honest.
*  This is not, of course, what Smoltrich and sort of the far right in Israel would have
*  wanted.
*  This is not a full-scale invasion.
*  We're not talking about mass strikes across large parts of Lebanon.
*  If this person is as senior as the Israelis say he was, being sort of a right-hand man
*  to Hassan Nasrallah, somebody who was in charge of sort of the strategic arm of Hezbollah's
*  whole military operation, taking him out and taking him out inside of Beirut is like a
*  pretty serious assassination.
*  And so I think it's pretty hard to predict whether this is something that Hezbollah feels
*  like they can maybe respond in some sort of way that makes it look like they're not
*  just accepting it but doesn't sort of take this up another notch or whether they consider
*  this the Israelis now crossing one of their red lines.
*  So Ben, this is really quite a dramatic moment.
*  And it's making me wonder where things go from here.
*  I mean, we have this massive number of people displaced, this ratcheting up.
*  Is this it?
*  Are we now tipping into an all-out war?
*  We're very much standing on a precipice.
*  We're in a very different place than we were just a few days ago.
*  Then we were primarily watching this back and forth tit for tat that seemed to be organized
*  in some kind of confines, that there was kind of a general understanding of what kinds of
*  attacks you could do and how to keep this thing contained.
*  So the question right now is, is there any way for the sides to step back from this or
*  is it going to get worse?
*  I mean, I was in Lebanon a week before last and did a number of interviews with families
*  who've been displaced from the south, living in quite poor conditions.
*  And I mean, then their main concern was whether they would be able to go back, whether their
*  homes were destroyed.
*  And now the question is very much, is the whole situation going to get worse and are
*  more people going to be displaced?
*  My colleague, Isabel Kirchner in Jerusalem, did similar interviews on the Israeli side
*  and found very similar things.
*  Israelis who have been outside of their homes since early on in the war.
*  And if this battle along the border escalates to another level, that is going to make it
*  even harder for these people to return home.
*  And so we're in a critical new stage here.
*  And what the two sides decide to do in the next few days is going to really determine
*  where this goes.
*  Ben, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  As of Tuesday night, the death toll from the strike in Beirut had reached at least three
*  civilians, including two children, and more than 70 people had been injured.
*  In a dramatic development early Wednesday morning, Hamas announced that its political
*  leader, Ismail Haniyeh, had been assassinated in Tehran.
*  Haniyeh, a key figure in Hamas's leadership, was in Iran to attend the inauguration ceremony
*  of the country's new president.
*  The killing was a major blow to Hamas and raised the specter of a wider war with Iran,
*  which is likely to see the killing on its soil as an act of aggression by Israel.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  In Venezuela, at least 16 people have died and about 750 have been arrested as a result
*  of protests following the highly contentious presidential election over the weekend.
*  The nation's autocratic leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who claimed victory, has
*  refused to release the full results, and many countries have said the vote was marred by
*  widespread irregularities.
*  Both sides of the country's political divide called on followers to take to the streets.
*  On Tuesday, the U.S. Women's X Team won its first gold at the Olympic Games in Paris,
*  led by Simone Biles, who is now the most decorated gymnast in history, and Sunisa Lee, the defending
*  all-around champion.
*  Biles called the Paris Games her redemption tour after she withdrew from the Games in
*  Tokyo three years ago because of a mental block.
*  Italy took home the silver and Brazil won the bronze for the all-around team event.
