# The Lawyers Now Turning on Trump
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW1w8KTwtPs)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Over the past few days, two of the lawyers who tried to help Donald Trump stay in power
*  after losing the 2020 election pleaded guilty in a Georgia racketeering case and have agreed
*  to cooperate with prosecutors against the former president.
*  Today, my colleague Richard Fauset on why Trump's own advisors are now flipping.
*  It's Tuesday, October 24th.
*  Richard, of all the court cases against Donald Trump, and there are many of them, you told
*  us from the start that the case filed against him in Georgia, accusing him of trying to
*  steal the 2020 election there, was extremely important, largely because of the nature of
*  the prosecution.
*  It's a racketeering case that treats Trump as the leader of a criminal conspiracy.
*  And the way that these cases work frequently is that in order to convict a person at the
*  top of a case like this, you tend to need lower level defendants, co-conspirators, to
*  flip, to turn on Trump.
*  That's right. And this is what we wondered from the beginning, which of these 19 indicted
*  co-conspirators might end up trying to make a deal, pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate
*  with prosecutors.
*  In fact, a former prosecutor here in Georgia once told us that, you know, imagine this
*  multi-person racketeering conspiracy indictment that lists 19 people and imagine it as a
*  kind of carpet that you roll up from the bottom.
*  A lot of times the most prominent figure in a racketeering indictment will be listed as
*  what prosecutors actually sometimes called dude number one.
*  In this case, it's Donald J.
*  Trump who's dude number one.
*  And imagine rolling up these smaller, lower level participants in the alleged scheme,
*  who then produce a lot of pressure on the way up.
*  So there's always a question about who was going to participate, who was going to want
*  to strike a deal, who was going to feel the pressure.
*  And we've started to see an answer to that.
*  Last month, we saw a guy flip named Scott Hall.
*  He's this Georgia bail bondsman who's very politically connected, who's one of these
*  seemingly almost random characters who was not very well known until he ends up being
*  indicted, who was just kind of mixed up in all this stuff.
*  But it's really in the last few days that we've started to feel the momentum build on
*  behalf of prosecutors with the plea deals struck by two lawyers who are deeply involved
*  in the effort to overturn the election in Donald Trump's favor.
*  So tell us about these two lawyers.
*  So the first one to take a plea was Sidney Powell, who I think might be the best known
*  to people who were following along on television and elsewhere when Donald Trump was
*  trying to make the case that the election had been stolen from him, which it had not.
*  Miss Powell is a former federal prosecutor who'd become a defense attorney.
*  Sidney Powell is Michael Flynn's lawyer.
*  She joins us tonight.
*  Thank you.
*  And she got on Donald Trump's radar when she began defending Michael Flynn, the former
*  Trump administration official.
*  I believe the Department of Justice is withholding a lot of information, as is all of the people
*  who participated in the complete setup of General Michael Flynn.
*  She was quite pugnacious and...
*  Good afternoon.
*  And thank you very much for coming.
*  Fast forward to November 2020, after Election Day.
*  When I finish, Sidney Powell and then Jenner Ellis will follow me.
*  Miss Powell appears at a news conference with Rudolph Giuliani and others.
*  There are a lot more lawyers working on this, but we're the, I guess we're the senior
*  lawyers.
*  And she is introduced as a member of this sort of legal dream team for the Donald Trump
*  campaign.
*  And it's there that she starts laying out some of these rather wild conspiracy theories.
*  What we are really dealing with here and uncovering more by the day is the interference
*  with our elections here in the United States.
*  The theories that are pretty well known at this point are just sort of beyond preposterous.
*  The Dominion voting systems were created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chavez
*  to make sure he never lost an election.
*  They involve Venezuela.
*  They involve Cuba and China.
*  Their office in Toronto was shared with one of the Soros entities.
*  They involve the investor George Soros, the Clintons.
*  They changed a million votes with no problem.
*  She talks about how voting machines have flipped millions of votes from Trump to Biden.
*  President Trump won by a landslide.
*  We are going to prove it and we are going to reclaim the United States of America for
*  the people who vote for freedom.
*  She later shows up at a meeting in December at the White House, this extremely raucous
*  meeting where all kinds of sort of disturbing ideas are discussed.
*  And among them is the idea of Sidney Powell being appointed a sort of special counsel
*  to look into these issues of voting, alleged voting fraud and doing something about it.
*  Right. So ultimately, what Sidney Powell does that lands her in this case is that she
*  becomes a spokesperson for and ultimately an advisor trying to advance these theories
*  of how and why the election was stolen from Donald Trump.
*  And it wasn't just talk.
*  She was trying to guide Trump to an outcome that would overturn the election.
*  Yes. And according to the indictment, she was also involved in.
*  In fact, is alleged to have directed and paid for a data breach in the elections office
*  in a tiny rural county south of Atlanta called Coffee County, Georgia.
*  This was an effort by Ms.
*  Powell and others to try to find data that might show that Mr.
*  Trump was indeed right.
*  And this data breach became the subject of a number of other criminal felony charges
*  against her that are also listed in this indictment.
*  OK, so that's Powell. Tell us about the second lawyer to turn on Trump in this case.
*  The second lawyer had a lot less exposure when a lot of this stuff is being kind of
*  fought over on social media and on television.
*  The January 6 report is now out.
*  We've got you covered on a lot of the highlights.
*  Bannon, Giuliani, Eastman.
*  But then there's a name even news junkies might not know well.
*  Kenneth Chesbrough.
*  It's a Harvard trained lawyer by the name of Kenneth Chesbrough.
*  This the person that the committee identified here, this known pro-Trump attorney
*  named Kenneth Chesbrough, right, as being the original architect of the fake electors
*  plot. Did you hear anything about that?
*  I did not. Yeah, that was not a name that I was familiar with.
*  You know, it's this is just very bizarre for me because Ken Chesbrough was my law
*  school classmate, someone I I've known for a very long time.
*  He was known as the cheese in law school.
*  And he is someone who's really practiced very much on his own for many years.
*  He worked with Mr. Chesbrough was involved in drafting a number of memos in the
*  effort to send slates of pro-Trump electoral college electors to Washington to
*  allow for a different outcome to the certification of the election.
*  This was something that was not happening on Fox, on CNN, the way it was with Sidney
*  Powell. But in some ways, it was really a more substantial effort to create the
*  legal underpinnings to turn the election in Mr. Trump's favor.
*  Right. And just to remind everyone how this was going to work, the logic of what
*  Chesbrough was doing was that he was trying to make sure that if Trump got his way on
*  January 6, ultimately January 7, and his vice president, Mike Pence, refused to
*  certify the election in Congress as Trump wanted, that there would be an alternate
*  slate of state electors ready to say that they were behind Trump, even though the
*  popular vote in their states had gone to Biden.
*  That's right. And his role in setting up these slates of alternate electors was
*  really at the heart of the charges against him in Georgia.
*  OK, so what do both of these lawyers, Powell, Chesbrough, ultimately plead
*  guilty to in Georgia over the past few days?
*  So it was this very chaotic moment for both lawyers, because when you talk to
*  people who've done this kind of thing before, they'll tell you that a lot of
*  times a plea deal, arranging it is kind of like when you're trying to sell a car
*  to somebody, when somebody's starting to say, yeah, I'll take the Buick, you just
*  want to kind of nail them down right there.
*  OK, you're taking the Buick, you're taking it with the sidewalls and blah, blah,
*  blah. So these plea deals came together quickly and they caught many of us in the
*  press corps unawares.
*  Can you please state your true and correct legal name?
*  Sydney Catherine Powell.
*  You just suddenly had these people showing up in court and entering pleas.
*  How do you plead to the six counts of conspiracy to commit intentional
*  interference with the performance of election duties?
*  Guilty.
*  Sydney Powell pleaded guilty to a number of counts of a misdemeanor
*  conspiracy to commit intentional interference
*  with performance of election duties, which is a mouthful.
*  But it was basically misdemeanors related to the fact that she was involved in this
*  caper to work with an elections official in Coffee County, Georgia,
*  to steal the data there.
*  Has anyone forced, threatened or promised you anything in order to enter into this
*  guilty plea?
*  Other than what is recited in the documents now.
*  And a few days later, please lower your hand and state your true and correct legal
*  name. Kenneth John Chesbro.
*  In the case of Kenneth Chesbro, how do you plead to count 15 conspiracy to commit
*  filing false documents in indictment number two, three, SC one eight eight nine
*  four seven guilty?
*  Have you and your Chesbro pleads guilty to one
*  felony count?
*  And that count is conspiracy to commit the filing of false documents.
*  And this is related to the fact that the fake electors slate, the pro Trump
*  electors slate in Georgia actually filed with federal officials their votes.
*  And the document said that this was a certificate of the votes of the 2020
*  electors from Georgia, when of course it was not.
*  All right. Good luck, Mr. Chesbro.
*  Thank you so much. Thank you.
*  So they both ended up pleading to much less serious charges than they were
*  originally charged with, which were a number of felonies.
*  Mm hmm. And what is the penalty?
*  The cost to each of these lawyers of pleading guilty to the charges you just
*  described?
*  Well, both of them are staying out of prison.
*  Both of them are going to have to do some time on probation, pay various fines,
*  and each of them was told to write a letter of apology to the people of Georgia.
*  Hmm. And as a result of this plea, what kind and what level of cooperation will
*  Powell and Chesbro be required to offer this district attorney in Georgia in
*  return for what clearly sounds like pretty modest sentences?
*  They've both promised to give up the case.
*  They've both promised to give up documents.
*  Presumably, this would include email exchanges, text messages with anyone
*  involved in this case and this alleged conspiracy.
*  They've each already recorded a statement with prosecutors.
*  We don't know exactly what's in that statement or those statements, rather.
*  But you're tempted to assume that it's something that's pretty good for the
*  prosecution, given the fact that these were relatively light sentences they got
*  off with. And of course, they have agreed to
*  testify truthfully against any of their former co-defendants.
*  That doesn't necessarily mean that they will show up in court for those very
*  dramatic moments where you're pointing to identifying your former co-defendants
*  who are still on trial, but it could happen.
*  Right. Quite possibly they could end up becoming star witnesses against Trump,
*  who just so happens to be the leading Republican presidential nominee in 2024.
*  And it feels Richard Worth noting that despite these modest sentences, these
*  plea deals still entail some risk for these lawyers.
*  I mean, it's unheard of in Trump's universe for people to publicly turn on him,
*  let alone to turn on him in a court case.
*  And that's because people tend to fear his wrath and the wrath of his supporters,
*  which is real. Yeah, I think you're right.
*  That there could be potentially very steep costs to turning against a very
*  powerful guy, a very powerful, historically rather vindictive guy.
*  But there are also reasons why it probably seemed quite compelling for these
*  people to flip.
*  And these are reasons beyond merely trying to avoid going to prison.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Richard, talk to us about why flipping, why pleading guilty ended up, we
*  think, seeming so compelling to these two lawyers beyond, as you said, their
*  understandable desire to avoid jail time.
*  Well, this case in Georgia involves a number of lawyers, a number of the 19
*  original co-defendants were in fact lawyers.
*  And you guys have probably heard the joke that MAGA in this context stands for
*  making attorneys get attorneys.
*  That's been an operative thing here.
*  And for Sidney Powell and for Kenneth Chesbrough, these are people whose
*  personal lives, certainly their professional lives, are fully defined by
*  the fact that they are officers of the court, that they're lawyers.
*  The concern about getting hit with a felony of such a type that you end up
*  losing your ability to practice law has been a huge pressure among a number of
*  these people. Nobody wants to cop to something that's going to have them lose
*  their law licenses.
*  And that was a possibility for both of them.
*  It was a possibility for both of them.
*  And it may well be we're not exactly in a place where we can say with clarity
*  what's going to happen to these two lawyers and their ability to keep
*  practicing law.
*  But by negotiating with prosecutors for a lighter sentence, they've put
*  themselves in a position where they may actually be able to keep their law
*  licenses. Got it.
*  But there's another factor that probably played into their decision to take a
*  plea. And that is the fact that hanging in for a trial that the judge had told
*  potential jurors was going to last five months is just an exceedingly expensive
*  proposition. And unlike Donald Trump, these two folks can't turn to
*  fundraising appeal to their political base and raise the millions that it might
*  have taken for them to pay their lawyers.
*  Right. So ultimately, it may not have just come down to the facts of the case.
*  It may not have come down just to their future as lawyers.
*  It may have also come down to a question of money.
*  Which is pretty fascinating. Ultimately, both Powell and Chespero, you're saying
*  they may have ended up pleading guilty here so that they don't lose their
*  livelihood and they don't end up going bankrupt.
*  Yeah. I mean, a lot of times you hear this from liberal critics of the criminal
*  justice system. When a RICO case is brought against a big gang or alleged
*  members of a gang, there are these moments where these smaller fries are
*  looking at the same kinds of problems that these very prominent lawyers are
*  looking at, facing a very long trial and not having the money to pay for adequate
*  counsel. The question is, does that really constitute the pursuit of justice?
*  And of course, two lawyers with pretty healthy incomes aren't the same as some
*  of the folks in the legal system that you're referring to.
*  But your point is that at the end of the day, these decisions may not be about
*  big questions of whether someone thinks they can win the case or whether they
*  should put up the fight. But the reality that putting up a serious defense is
*  expensive and intimidating and sometimes it feels like not really a choice.
*  Yeah. And in this case, you have a lot of really kind of esoteric questions of
*  constitutional law, the supremacy clause and when it's right to charge federal
*  officials and the functioning of their duties and all this kind of stuff.
*  Really kind of fascinating stuff that lawyers are going to be writing law
*  review articles about for decades, if not centuries.
*  But there also is just this practical matter.
*  A trial is going to happen. It's going to cost five months.
*  The lawyer for these lawyers to charge X.
*  And are you going to be able to pay X at the end of the day?
*  This, of course, makes me wonder whether and if not why Donald Trump hasn't
*  offered to pay the legal bills for these two lawyers.
*  It would seem like what's in their best interest here is in his best interest as
*  a co-defendant. He knows very well that the legal strategy here is rolling up the
*  carpet and getting to him, dude number one.
*  So why isn't he trying to make their financial problems go away here?
*  That's a great question.
*  And I don't really have a lot of insight into the mind of former President Trump.
*  You would think that finding a way to help some of these people fund their
*  defenses would in fact help them out.
*  All we really know is that a number of these folks involved in this indictment
*  have had to turn to super creative means to try to raise the money to pay their
*  legal defenses. Like a fundraising website called Give Send Go.
*  It's kind of a conservative version of GoFundMe.
*  There is one very obscure defendant, an Illinois pastor who, working through his
*  allies, was hoping to receive some funding with a cut of sales from organic
*  MAGA honey that is actually packaged in a like a honey bear with Trump's head where
*  the bear's head would be.
*  Unexpected.
*  Yeah. So it's, these are serious manifestations of the problem, which is
*  that they need cash to fund their defenses.
*  Okay. So I want to end by casting us forward just a little bit.
*  As you said at the start of this conversation, this legal strategy from the
*  district attorney here in Georgia seems to be working so far.
*  And I wonder if we should then assume that there's a domino effect and that the
*  rest of the co-defendants, especially those lower down on the long list, watch
*  Powell and Chesper O'Flynn and think, well, I got to get my deal now.
*  And that that becomes a pretty virtuous cycle for the district attorney.
*  So should we expect a series of guilty pleas over the coming many weeks and
*  months adding up to a very problematic situation for Donald Trump?
*  We are waiting and watching.
*  There are a number of people who are probably in a much worse financial
*  position than either Kenneth Chesper O'Flynn or Sidney Powell, who just don't
*  have any money at all.
*  The possibility of them sitting through a trial that would last many, many months
*  and trying to find a way not only to pay attorney's fees, but just to find an
*  Airbnb or to find a motel or a hotel to stay in for six months in Georgia, could
*  be just tremendously painful for them economically.
*  And in fact, it could be just virtually impossible.
*  So although we don't know exactly who might flip next or whether anyone will
*  flip next, we're certainly watching pretty closely.
*  And if you're Trump, you're watching very, very closely.
*  And I have to think your legal strategy is starting to adjust to the reality that
*  your alleged co-conspirators are becoming your enemies in that courtroom.
*  That's right.
*  And I think there are still a number of ways in which Donald Trump's lawyers are
*  seeing a way out of this, either trying to find a way to maneuver things in such
*  a way that the case never goes to trial here based on some constitutional
*  principles.
*  Maybe this case gets before the Supreme Court, before a jury in Fulton County,
*  Georgia can really rule on his fate.
*  And I think there are unresolved questions that remain in this trial.
*  Some of them have to do with state of mind, with whether or not prosecutors can
*  successfully show a jury that Donald Trump really knew he lost this election
*  and yet pushed as hard as he could to say he was the winner and to in fact, try
*  to take it anyway.
*  We don't really know exactly what some of this new cooperation means for that
*  very central question.
*  But in general terms, none of this is good for Donald Trump.
*  We have two lawyers who were deeply involved in various elements of the
*  effort to keep him in power.
*  And now they're talking to prosecutors.
*  Well, Richard, thank you very much.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, Israel's military struck hundreds of targets in Gaza in one of its
*  biggest barrages since its war with Hamas began.
*  Hamas now claims that such airstrikes have killed more than 5000 Palestinians
*  since October 7th, when Israel began retaliating for a Hamas attack that killed
*  1400 Israelis.
*  Despite the perception that an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza is imminent, the
*  Times reports that the Biden administration has advised Israel to delay such an
*  offensive.
*  That delay is designed to allow for more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and to
*  give Hamas more time to release the hostages that it's holding there.
*  On Monday night, Hamas released two more of those hostages, both elderly women who
*  had been abducted at Aki Butz in southern Israel.
*  And the union representing striking American autoworkers told nearly 7000
*  employees at a pickup truck plant in Michigan to walk off the job in a major
*  escalation of its six week long strike against Detroit's big three automakers.
*  The walkout is especially disruptive because the plant owned by Stellantis
*  makes the Ram 1500 one of the best selling pickup trucks in the country.
*  To end the strike, the union is demanding significantly higher wages and the
*  reinstatement of traditional pensions for retiring workers.
