# The Sunday Read: ‘Why Are These Italians Massacring Each Other With Oranges?’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkcco_dXi2c)
*  Hi, my name is John Moallam, and I'm a contributing writer to the New York Times magazine.
*  For today's Sunday read, I'm going to share a story I wrote for the magazine's Voyages
*  issue about my trip to a small town in northern Italy for what has to be one of the world's
*  most peculiar festivals, basically a three-day historical food fight.
*  So here's my story from the March 26, 2023 New York Times magazine, The Voyages Issue.
*  It looked as if a war was coming.
*  It was.
*  One Sunday last month, in a northern Italian town called Ivrea, the facades of historic
*  buildings were covered with plastic sheeting and nets.
*  Forefront windows had been fortified with plywood and tarps.
*  And in several different piazzas, hundreds of wooden crates had appeared, walls of them
*  stacked eight feet high and even farther across.
*  The crates looked like barricades, but were actually arms depots.
*  Inside them were oranges.
*  Oranges.
*  The fruit.
*  Over the next three days, 8,000 people in Ivrea would throw 900 tons of oranges at one
*  another, one orange at a time, while tens of thousands of other people watched.
*  They would throw the oranges very hard, very viciously, often while screaming profanities
*  at their targets or yelling like Braveheart.
*  And they would throw the oranges for hours until their eyebrows were matted with pulp
*  and their shirts soaked through.
*  But they would also keep smiling as they threw the oranges, embracing and joking and
*  cheering one another on, exhibiting with their total beings a deranged seeming but euphoric
*  sense of abandon and belonging.
*  A freedom that was easy to envy, but difficult to understand.
*  The Battle of the Oranges is an annual tradition in Ivrea and part of a larger celebration
*  described by its organizers as the most ancient historical carnival in Italy.
*  Three years ago, things kicked off as they always do, with a few initial hours of hurling
*  and splattering, but then the rest of the battle was abruptly called off.
*  COVID had surfaced in the region, and after an emergency meeting of government officials
*  that afternoon, the decision was made to shut the festival down.
*  Several people in Ivrea told me that, as two more pandemic years passed in which no orange
*  oranges could be thrown, they grew concerned that something bad would happen in the community.
*  That without this catharsis, a certain pent-up sinister energy would explode.
*  But it didn't.
*  They'd made it.
*  And now the scent of stockpiled citrus was mixing with the musk of centuries-old masonry.
*  The aranceri, or orange throwers, were standing by.
*  Ivrea's aranceri are organized into nine teams, each with a different flag, logo, captain,
*  and uniform.
*  They have names like the Devils, the Mercenaries, the Black Panthers, Death.
*  As 2pm approached, the aranceri crammed shoulder to shoulder in their assigned piazzas, each
*  waiting to do battle with 47 brigades of other orange throwers who had come marauding through
*  the city in horse-drawn carts.
*  Many had been partying until 2 or 3am the night before, and many were drinking that
*  morning too.
*  The city was awash in disposable cups of mulled wine and bombardino, a boozy, eggnoggy concoction,
*  served warm.
*  They were predominantly men, especially young men, though there were many women too.
*  There were also older people who'd been participating in the Battle of the Oranges since they were
*  the age of those young people.
*  Some had taken those young people to their first battles in strollers 20 odd years ago.
*  One woman showed me a photo with pride.
*  In a neighborhood known as the Borghetto, a team called the Tuchini polished off compostable
*  bowls of pasta in their small piazza, waiting in their green jerseys with poofy sleeves
*  and lace-up fronts.
*  Over their heads hung a banner,
*  In the heart of the battle, we are never alone.
*  Here's what happened next.
*  The atmosphere in the Borghetto contracted like a fist.
*  Around the corner, the first carriage approached, barreling across the cobblestone bridge that
*  connects the neighborhood to the rest of the city.
*  You could hear the low rumble of its wheels on stone, the bells on the horses' bridles,
*  jingling madly.
*  As soon as the carriage appeared, the fusillade and the screaming started simultaneously.
*  Much of the crowd rushed to its flanks.
*  Inside the carriage, about half a dozen people dressed as medieval soldiers, their heads
*  and faces disguised by creepy leather helmets adorned with braids, were already side-arming
*  oranges mercilessly with both hands, their thick forearms pumping like pistons, their
*  emptied fists reloading from the troughs at their waist while the opposite fists discharged.
*  They chucked oranges in a kind of balletic flow state, the brutal apparatuses of their
*  torsos swiveling efficiently but hard.
*  They threw straight down, punishing the people only two feet below, who in turn threw relentlessly
*  upward at them.
*  Oranges sprayed through the air, omnidirectionally, like sawdust, like sparks.
*  The carriage came to a full stop at the center of the square.
*  The battle reached a higher intensity.
*  Oranges splattered off the soldiers' heads and rolled off their backs in sheets.
*  The scene is so chaotic that once, a decade ago, a thrower in one of the carriages had
*  a heart attack, but no one noticed his body slumped there until they were getting out
*  of the carriage.
*  When the carriage started moving again, exiting the piazza, the diehards gave chase.
*  They yelled at it through a froth of spittle and pith.
*  In the calm that followed, people scampered around to claim oranges off the ground that
*  looked intact enough to be relaunched.
*  Then the next carriage arrived, and everything that just happened, happened again.
*  I had the opportunity to participate that first afternoon, though I'd been given zero
*  instructions or tips.
*  Ordinarily, our interior must register with the team weeks in advance and pay the roughly
*  120 euro fee, but someone from the historic Carnival of Ivrea Foundation, which organizes
*  the event, had simply gifted me an emasculatingly oversized tuchini jersey and wished me luck.
*  I took up a position on the periphery, tossing the occasional orange from long range, feeling
*  giddy when my first one thwacked into a soldier's helmet and liquefied spectacularly.
*  What I hadn't understood, though, is that many people were winging oranges at the carriages
*  from similar distances and from all directions.
*  Tracers from this circular firing squad were sailing over the carriage, were streaking
*  past the bodies on board and whizzing straight at the people on the other side, catching
*  shoulders, forearms, temples, mouths.
*  Once into the first skirmish, I took one off the crown of my head.
*  A few minutes later, a woman crossed in front of me, hollering to a companion that she'd
*  been struck in the eye.
*  I looked down to record that little moment in my notebook.
*  A catastrophic mistake.
*  I never saw the orange coming, and it struck in precisely the worst possible spot.
*  Doubled over, staggering and groaning, panting and panicked, I worried it might be serious,
*  life-altering even.
*  I pictured having to explain the injury to a urologist, or worse, a reconstructive surgeon
*  specializing in intimate parts.
*  It took many hours for my insides to feel right.
*  From then on, I concentrated on watching and dodging.
*  For the next three days, I'd see Arncheri in demonic face paint and body paint, and
*  one with a bullseye scrawled on his bald head with the words, throw it here.
*  I'd watch a grown woman duck for cover behind her much smaller, much older mother, both
*  giggling as the oranges rained down.
*  And a slender, deadpan-faced guy walked through a piazza as the next carriage approached,
*  with a cardboard sign that said, my father is the first one in the carriage.
*  Kill him.
*  I'd watch people nonchalantly rolling cigarettes just steps from the crossfire.
*  A group of battered young people, walking arm-in-arm, saturated with juice, singing
*  When the Saints Go Marching In in imperfect but exuberant English.
*  I'd witness several so-called baptisms, in which a first-timer, or an Arncheri otherwise
*  perceived to be weak, kneels on the ground while a tight circle of his teammates whips
*  over ripe oranges at his face from inches away.
*  Is that blood?
*  I'd hear one young man ask another, examining his left ear.
*  It's blood orange, the friend clarified.
*  Though I'd see plenty of actual blood, too, crusting under nostrils, catching the sunlight
*  on a dark, puffy lip.
*  And from time to time, whenever the throwers aboard the carriages momentarily ran out of
*  oranges, I'd watch them, one by one, raise their empty palms, remove their leather helmets,
*  and make a magnificent gesture of clapping for the Arncheri on foot, who, just as graciously,
*  returned their applause.
*  There was a lot I found alarming about the Battle of the Oranges, or that made me recoil,
*  but this touched me every time.
*  Everyone throwing and being thrown at, working together to have a good time.
*  That said, even minutes into that first skirmish in the Borghetto, I truly couldn't imagine
*  how everyone could keep it up for three more hours, then do it all again for two more days.
*  The emotions being unleashed, the outpouring of ferocity mixed with joy, seemed unsustainable,
*  a once-in-a-lifetime rush.
*  Besides, the ground was already covered in an electric yellow mash, the juice bled out,
*  the slurry congealed.
*  Soon there would be three to four inches of it carpeting Iveria's piazzas end to end,
*  mounds and streaks all over the adjoining streets.
*  It was enough to suction your boots in place if you stood in it too long, enough to close
*  a school district if the oranges were snow.
*  Even when you put your foot down into it, it burped upward like a simmering marinara
*  and splotched the ankles of your pants.
*  This material turned gray, then brown in the afternoon air, all while other, fresher oranges
*  kept exploding off foreheads, faces, cheeks and chests and touching down.
*  At any given moment you'd see bright, recognizable chunks of citrus smushed in at the surface
*  of the mess.
*  It looked exactly like vomit.
*  It looked as if the city itself had thrown up.
*  And somewhere in there, surely, were also pockets of manure from the horses, which,
*  held stationary at the center of the battles, could be seen baring their teeth and taking
*  a crap.
*  This was the muck that Iveria's street cleaning machinery would be left to confront three
*  evenings straight.
*  And though the heroic little brush truck succeeded in sucking up the bulk of it, they couldn't
*  clean everything.
*  It compressed the remnants into the channels between the cobblestones and left a colorless
*  scum coating the surface of the town.
*  It was super slick.
*  Many people, delicate-looking older people, mothers with infants strapped to their chests,
*  tread carefully without complaint.
*  Others took running starts, turned sideways, and enjoyed the ride.
*  During the final moments of the battle one afternoon, I watched a middle-aged man cross
*  of the town's largest piazza, holding a glass of red wine, an actual glass.
*  He'd just taken a sip when suddenly his feet skidded outward and he crashed on his side.
*  He landed facing the wrong direction.
*  He did not see the carriage turn the corner and bear down right behind him.
*  A younger man from the orange cherry team, deaf, his black uniform drenched, his head
*  topped with a tangle of brightly dyed hair, dashed off the sidewalk, grabbed the fallen
*  man by the arm, and dragged him out of the way of the horses at the very last second.
*  The man glided frictionlessly, hydroplaning like an air hockey puck.
*  Finally rising to his feet, he examined his glass and found it mostly full.
*  He'd managed to hold it aloft the entire time.
*  There were hardly any streaks up the sides.
*  But why?
*  Why oranges?
*  Why throw oranges?
*  Why?
*  Eight centuries ago, more or less, present-day Ivrea was ruled by a despot, the Marquis
*  Ranieri di Biondrate.
*  The Marquis was despicable, stingy, cruel.
*  He customarily abducted peasant women on their wedding nights and raped them.
*  One night, however, according to a mishmash of history and legend, a miller's daughter
*  named Violetta managed to fight him off.
*  Before long, she appeared in the window of the tyrant's castle by firelight, holding
*  his decapitated head in one hand.
*  A revolt ignited, instantly.
*  Violetta's defiance incited the populace to burn the palace to the ground, freeing
*  themselves to do whatever they pleased.
*  And what pleased them, apparently, was to hurl oranges at one another annually for three
*  days straight.
*  Sort of.
*  I'm skipping over 30-odd generations of local history in which the tradition complexified
*  and evolved, before assuming its current form in the years after World War II.
*  Initially, in the Middle Ages, the people of the Ivrea threw beans at one another.
*  It wasn't until the mid-1800s that they first weaponized oranges, assimilating another local
*  tradition wherein girls on balconies tossed oranges at boys they liked.
*  But whatever the food stuff, the idea has always been to simultaneously commemorate
*  Ivrea's rebellion and celebrate the freedom it brought.
*  The burly warriors on the carriages are stand-ins for the Marquis' feudal army, while the
*  arancheri on foot, who route them out of the piazzas again and again, represent the rampaging
*  populace.
*  At some point, the tradition was also fused to the traditional celebration of Carnival,
*  which allows for similarly unrestrained raucousness and heavy drinking in the days leading up
*  to Lent.
*  So to sum up, its live-action role-playing, its historical reenactment, its Mardi Gras
*  held at Colonial Williamsburg with head wounds and fruit.
*  In fact, the Orange Throwing is only the most attention-grabbing ritual in a sprawl of ancillary
*  Carnival traditions in Ivrea.
*  The whole program begins many weeks earlier with a ceremonial parade in early January,
*  then proceeds through one fastidiously prescribed rite after another, such as a gathering of
*  ten children convened on the Saturday before the third to last Sunday before Carnival.
*  I struggled to follow the Dungeons and Dragons-like complexity of it all, even the stuff happening
*  while I was in town.
*  The eleven separate bean feasts, a ceremony in which a recently married couple in each
*  of Ivrea's neighborhoods digs a hole, the thirty-foot poles covered in dried heather
*  and juniper that are placed at the center of certain piazzas and ignited into frightening
*  pillars of flame.
*  You don't explain Carnival, one woman told me.
*  You live it.
*  I just knew every morning to put on my Beretto Frigio, a long red stocking cap that spectators
*  must wear at all times during Carnival while within Ivrea's City Hall.
*  The Beretto Frigio identifies you as a supporter of self-determination and freedom.
*  Walk around without a Beretto Frigio and the Orange Charity may attack.
*  You will be targeted, I heard one of Carnival's organizers warn a reporter who'd arrived
*  in a stylish red headband instead of the hat.
*  Presiding over all of this is a coterie of characters plucked haphazardly from other
*  periods in Ivrea's history, parading around in antiquarian costumes.
*  Each year, different high-status local people are given the honor of playing a particular
*  role.
*  These include the General, who is granted symbolic control over the city for the duration
*  of Carnival by Ivrea's actual mayor, and the Assistant Grand Chancellor, who records
*  the successful completion of each persnickety tradition in a large fancy book.
*  These dignitaries also help fund the festivities in exchange for their appointments, with some
*  of them cutting checks for as much as 30,000 euros.
*  The unquestioned star of Carnival, however, is the Vetsosa Munyaya, or Charming Miller's
*  Daughter, an embodiment of Violetta, who sparked the original revolt.
*  The Munyaya spends much of Carnival crisscrossing the city in a golden chariot, wearing a white
*  gown and green sash, heaving armfuls of candy and flowers overboard to the crowds.
*  Everywhere she goes, the fighting stops, and hundreds of people shriek, Viva la Munyaya!
*  and basically lose their minds.
*  The identity of each year's Munyaya is kept secret until the night before the first Orange
*  Battle.
*  Shortly after arriving in town, I watched from Ivrea's packed central piazza as a
*  congress of men in brass studded coats and white wigs introduced her from the balcony
*  of the city hall.
*  They shouted the name Elena Bergamini in Bardus, and a dark haired woman appeared in an adjacent
*  window waving both arms feverishly back and forth.
*  As a greeting, it had a bizarre intensity.
*  She looked as if she were trying to stop an airplane taxiing recklessly toward the wrong
*  way.
*  The crowd turned rapturous.
*  Her name would not have been familiar to most of those cheering in the piazza.
*  Bergamini in Bardus is a former concert clarinetist and mother of two who works for a nearby municipality.
*  But she was their Munyaya now, and that was enough.
*  Eventually the Munyaya climbed into her chariot and exited the square.
*  Everyone filed out behind her.
*  Suddenly a parade.
*  There were drummers and fife players screeching away on their wooden flutes, and the general
*  in his military regalia, his hand held in a firm salute as though he were an oil painting
*  of himself.
*  There were brigades of soldiers with muskets and spears, the arancheri teams dancing and
*  chanting beneath their towering flags, and waves of ordinary, elated Ivrayans and outsiders,
*  including, somewhere in the barely moving logjam of bodies toward the back, me.
*  The pace of the procession was glacial.
*  The claustrophobia was intense.
*  But I was the only one who seemed put out.
*  I had struggled to exit the parade and go around it, only to get stuck in the parade
*  again.
*  This became a theme.
*  Parades of various sizes and complexities snaked everywhere through Ivrea's streets
*  during Carnival.
*  And as I hustled to catch the end of some ceremony or keep various appointments in town,
*  I'd be blocked or absorbed by them again and again.
*  Parades crossed my path perpendicularly.
*  They clogged the road ahead.
*  Once I was trapped behind a parade only to have it suddenly turn around and come straight
*  at me.
*  It was an odd thing to keep happening to a person during a celebration of freedom, but
*  I simply could not outfox the parades.
*  They seemed to get bigger, longer, and slower whenever I tried.
*  Another time, I swear, a parade appeared to magically regenerate and pass in front of
*  me twice, as though the parade were a mobius strip.
*  One night, I was having a pleasant conversation in the lobby of City Hall and didn't notice
*  the uniformed brass players and soldiers amassing on the front staircase behind me, forming
*  a parade, trapping me inside.
*  Soon I'd tense up at the sound of distant fives.
*  Felt preposterous, like a metaphor, like a Kafka story.
*  A lowly office clerk in a European city who, every time he leaves his apartment, is encircled
*  and thwarted by ceremonial parades.
*  Except, this couldn't have been clearer.
*  I wasn't the protagonist.
*  I was nothing.
*  My autonomy and desires were subsumed by a tradition that belonged to and was beloved
*  by everyone else.
*  Every morning during the Battle of the Oranges, the new black eyes bloomed all over town.
*  Their other eyes, huge and purple cushions of flesh rose up.
*  Still others were bloody, or they should have been white.
*  These were signs of valor in Ivrea.
*  According to several team leaders I spoke to, people wanted to get bruised.
*  In fact, you'd periodically spot some gung-ho aron-cherry standing stock still behind a
*  carriage with his face raised toward the throwers to invite a direct hit, like a man who'd been
*  confined indoors for years, hypnotized by the heat of the sun.
*  And among the many patches I'd spot sewn onto people's jerseys was one with the same figure
*  used to indicate genders on bathroom doors, raising an arm to shield its face.
*  A thick, red line ran through the illustration.
*  It wasn't allowed.
*  By the time the last orange was thrown, 469 people would seek medical attention from the
*  on-site paramedics, though looking around you got the sense that these weren't necessarily
*  the most severely injured people, just the complainers.
*  And yet, what I almost never saw during the Battle of the Oranges was any public expression
*  of pain.
*  Only once, a young boy running into his mother's arms, wailing after being tagged in the eye.
*  Consider not only the pain of the impact, but the sting of the juice.
*  My theory was that jubilation was a powerful analgesic.
*  Everyone's pain receptors were short-circuited by delight.
*  Even among those at the edges of the battle, even among the spectators, there was a dispassionate
*  acceptance of the pandemonium that felt unreal.
*  There was the young woman struck suddenly by citrusy shrapnel, casually wiping down
*  her cheek in the middle of a conversation.
*  The man and woman snuggling tenderly with their backs turned to a carriage, her head
*  taking shelter in the crook of his neck.
*  The parents without fear for their children.
*  The children without fear for themselves.
*  Four days and Ivrea hadn't desensitized me to the unusualness of any of it.
*  For me, it was unrelatable, alienating at times.
*  Even many Italians outside Ivrea find the Battle of the Oranges embarrassing or uncivilized.
*  Every year, criticisms arise.
*  There is concern for the welfare of the horses pulling the carriages, disgust with all the
*  wasted food.
*  I'd read about steps taken to address these issues.
*  There's now a program to turn the spent oranges into compost and biofuel, for example.
*  But the historic carnival of Ivrea Foundation did not brag about these advancements the
*  way an American festival would.
*  At one point, Stefano Ampolini, who runs public relations for the Foundation and has been
*  a fanatical aranceri himself since boyhood, told me,
*  What we say in Ivrea is that the only orange that's wasted is the one we don't throw.
*  And when I mentioned to him that I'd seen that one boy get hit in the eye and start
*  crying, Ampolini said, yes, and moved on.
*  Tourists kept arriving, still mostly other Italians, relatively few, it seemed, from
*  abroad, and they definitely weren't unwelcome.
*  But there was little signage or material around to orient them, and shockingly few souvenirs
*  for them to buy.
*  Given the perilous environment, given how much locals needed those four days to provide
*  an all-consuming torrent of pleasure, it seemed like anyone else was kind of in the way.
*  Entertaining outsiders wasn't the point, nor was appeasing critics or massaging the optics
*  of young men hurting one another in the year 2023.
*  It seemed to me that the point of the carnival was exquisitely simple.
*  It was a game Ivrians loved playing together, for its own sake, and primarily among themselves.
*  This hit me most powerfully while stuck in one last parade.
*  It was the final procession of the festival, a somber late-night funeral march through
*  the medieval city to mourn carnival's end.
*  I genuinely thought I'd outsmarted this parade and beat it to its destination, but before
*  I knew what was happening, I was herded onto the side of the street with a crush of other
*  parade watchers, a blob of puffy jackets, some of them blotched with dried pulp.
*  The mood was solemn.
*  The aesthetic was spare.
*  There were no horses this time, no brass bands or drums.
*  It was the sad, out-of-tune quavering of a few wooden flutes while the general and his
*  entourage approached on foot.
*  The crowd did not make a sound.
*  Their reverence seemed total.
*  When a phone rang, it was stifled.
*  When a long, rubbery fart sounded in the stillness, not a single person laughed.
*  A fragile equilibrium was being maintained between the seriousness and unseriousness
*  of carnival, between how crazy the thing looked and how meaningful it felt.
*  I loved the Battle of Oranges for pulling that off.
*  It was the ugliest, beautiful thing I ever saw.
