*  Hi, my name is John Moalum and I'm a contributing writer to the New York Times magazine.
*  For today's Sunday read, I'm going to share a story I wrote for the magazine's voyages
*  issue about my trip to a small town in northern Italy for what has to be one of the world's
*  most peculiar festivals, basically a three-day historical food fight.
*  So here's my story from the March 26, 2023, New York Times magazine, the Voyages issue.
*  It looked as if a war was coming.
*  It was.
*  One Sunday last month in a northern Italian town called Ivereia, the facades of historic
*  buildings recovered with plastic sheeting and nets.
*  Four front windows had been fortified with plywood and tarps, and in several different
*  piazzas hundreds of wooden crates had appeared, walls of them stacked eight feet high and
*  even farther across.
*  The crates looked like barricades but were actually arms deep-hosts.
*  Inside them were oranges.
*  Oranges.
*  The fruit.
*  For the next three days, 8,000 people in Ivereia would throw 900 tons of oranges at one
*  another, one orange at a time, while tens of thousands of other people watched.
*  They would throw the oranges very hard, very viciously, often while screaming profanities
*  at their targets or yowling like brave heart, and they would throw the oranges for hours
*  until their eyebrows were matted with pulp and their shirts soaked through.
*  But they would also keep smiling as they threw the oranges, embracing and joking and cheering
*  on another on, exhibiting with their total beings a deranged, seeming but euphoric sense
*  of abandon and belonging, a freedom that was easy to envy but difficult to understand.
*  The Battle of the Oranges is an annual tradition in Ivereia and part of a larger celebration
*  described by its organizers as the most ancient historical carnival in Italy.
*  Three years ago, things kicked off as they always do, with a few initial hours of hurling
*  and splattering, but then the rest of the battle was abruptly called off.
*  COVID had surfaced in the region, and after an emergency meeting of government officials
*  that afternoon, the decision was made to shut the festival down.
*  Several people in Ivereia told me that there's two more pandemic years passed in which no
*  oranges could be thrown.
*  They grew concerned that something bad would happen in the community.
*  That without this catharsis, a certain pent-up sinister energy would explode.
*  But it didn't.
*  They'd made it.
*  And now, the scent of stockpiled citrus was mixing with the musk of centuries-old masonry.
*  The Arancherry, or Orange Throers, were standing by.
*  Ivereia's Arancherry are organized into nine teams, each with a different flag, logo,
*  captain, and uniform.
*  They have names like the devils, the mercenaries, the black panthers, death.
*  As 2pm approached, the Arancherry crammed shoulder to shoulder in their assigned piazzas,
*  each waiting to do battle with 47 brigades of other Orange Throers who had come marauding
*  through the city in horse-drawn carts.
*  Many had been partying until 2 or 3am, the night before, and many were drinking that
*  morning too.
*  The city was a wash and disposable cups of mold wine and bombardino, a boozy, eggnoggy
*  concoction, served warm.
*  They were predominantly men, especially young men, though there were many women too.
*  There were also older people who had been participating in the battle of the oranges since
*  they were the age of those young people.
*  Some had taken those young people to their first battles in Stroeler's 20 odd years ago.
*  One woman showed me a photo with pride.
*  In a neighborhood known as the Borgetto, the team called the Tukini polished off compostable
*  bowls of pasta in their small piazza, waiting in their green jerseys with poofy sleeves and
*  lace up fronts.
*  Over their heads hung a banner.
*  In the heart of the battle, we are never alone.
*  Here's what happened next.
*  The atmosphere in the Borgetto contracted like a fist.
*  Around the corner, the first carriage approached, barreling across the cobblestone bridge that
*  connects the neighborhood to the rest of the city.
*  You could hear the low rumble of its wheels on stone, the bells on the horses' bridles,
*  jingling madly.
*  As soon as the carriage appeared, the fuselot in the screaming started simultaneously, much
*  of the crowd rushed to its flanks.
*  Inside the carriage, about half a dozen people dressed as medieval soldiers, their heads
*  and faces disguised by creepy leather helmets adorned with braids.
*  We're already side-arming oranges mercilessly with both hands, their thick forearms pumping
*  like pistons, their emptied fists, reloading from the troughs at their waist while the opposite
*  fists discharged.
*  They chucked oranges in a kind of balledic flow state, the brutal apparatuses of their torsos
*  swiveling efficiently but hard.
*  They threw straight down, punishing the people only two feet below, who in turn threw relentlessly
*  upward at them.
*  Oranges sprayed through the air, omnidirectionally, like sawdust, like sparks.
*  The carriage came to a full stop at the center of the square.
*  The battle reached a higher intensity.
*  Oranges splattered off the soldier's heads and rolled off their backs and sheets.
*  The scene is so chaotic that once a decade ago, a thrower in one of the carriages had a
*  heart attack, but no one noticed his body slumped there until they were getting out of
*  the carriage.
*  When the carriage started moving again, exiting the piata, the die-hards gave chase.
*  They yelled at it through a froth of spittle and pith.
*  In the calm that followed, people scampered around to claim oranges off the ground that looked
*  intact enough to be relaunched.
*  Then the next carriage arrived, and everything that just happened happened again.
*  I had the opportunity to participate that first afternoon, though I'd been given zero
*  instructions or tips.
*  Ordinarily, our encherry must register with the team weeks in advance and pay the roughly
*  120 euro fee.
*  But someone from the historic carnival of Iverea Foundation, which organizes the event,
*  had simply gifted me in a masculatingly oversized to Keeney Jersey and wished me luck.
*  I took up a position on the periphery, tossing the occasional orange from long range, feeling
*  giddy when my first one thwacked into a soldier's helmet and liquefied spectacularly.
*  What I hadn't understood, though, is that many people were winging oranges at the carriages
*  from similar distances and from all directions.
*  Tracers from this circular firing squad were sailing over the carriage, were streaking
*  past the bodies on board and whizzing straight at the people on the other side, catching
*  shoulders, forearms, temples, mouths.
*  Seconds into the first skirmish, I took one off the crown of my head.
*  A few minutes later, a woman crossed in front of me, hollering to a companion that she'd
*  been struck in the eye.
*  I looked down to record that little moment in my notebook, a catastrophic mistake.
*  I never saw the orange coming, and it struck in precisely the worst possible spot.
*  Double-over, staggering and groaning, panting and panicked.
*  I worried it might be serious, life-altering even.
*  I pictured having to explain the injury to a urologist, or worse, a reconstructive surgeon
*  specializing in intimate parts.
*  It took many hours for my insides to feel right.
*  From then on, I concentrated on watching and dodging.
*  Over the next three days, I'd see our encherry in demonic face paint and body paint, and one
*  with a bullseye scrolled on his bald head with the words, throw it here.
*  I'd watch a grown woman duck for cover behind her much smaller, much older mother, both
*  giggling as the oranges rain down.
*  An asslender, deadpan faced guy, walked through a piazza as the next carriage approached,
*  with a cardboard sign that said, my father is the first one in the carriage.
*  Kill him.
*  I'd watch people nonchalantly rolling cigarettes just steps from the crossfire.
*  A group of battered young people walking arm and arm saturated with juice, singing when
*  the saints go marching in in imperfect but exuberant English.
*  I'd witnessed several so-called baptisms in which a first timer or an encherry otherwise
*  perceived to be weak, kneels on the ground while a tight circle of his teammates whips
*  over ripe oranges that his face from inches away.
*  Is that blood?
*  I'd hear one young man ask another, examining his left ear, it's blood orange, the friend
*  clarified.
*  Though I'd see plenty of actual blood too, crusting under nostrils, catching the sunlight
*  on a dark puffy lip.
*  And from time to time, whenever the throwers aboard the carriages momentarily ran out of
*  oranges, I'd watch them, one by one, raise their empty palms, remove their leather helmets,
*  and make a magnificent gesture of clapping for the orange-cherry on foot, who just as
*  graciously returned their applause.
*  There was a lot I found alarming about the battle of the oranges, where they made me
*  recoil, but this touched me every time, everyone throwing and being thrown at, working together
*  to have a good time.
*  That said, even minutes into that first skirmish in the burguetto, I truly couldn't imagine
*  how everyone could keep it up for three more hours, then do it all again for two more
*  days.
*  The emotions being unleashed, the outpouring, a ferocity mixed with joy seemed unsustainable,
*  a once in a lifetime rush.
*  Besides, the ground was already covered in an electric yellow mash, the juice bled out,
*  the slurry congealed.
*  Soon there would be three to four inches of it, carpeting Yvres Piazza's end-to-end, mounds
*  and streaks all over the adjoining streets.
*  It was enough to suction your boots in place if you stood in it too long, enough to close
*  a school district if the oranges were snow.
*  And when you put your foot down into it, it burped upward like a simmering marinara
*  and splotched the ankles of your pants.
*  This material turned gray, then brown in the afternoon air, all while other fresher oranges
*  kept exploding off foreheads, faces, cheeks and chests and touching down.
*  At any given moment, you'd see bright recognizable chunks of citrus smushed in at the surface
*  of the mess.
*  It looked exactly like vomit.
*  It looked as if the city itself had thrown up.
*  And somewhere in there, surely, were also pockets of manure from the horses, which held
*  stationary at the center of the battles, could be seen bearing their teeth and taking
*  a crap.
*  This was the muck that Iverea's street cleaning machinery would be left to confront three
*  evenings straight.
*  And though the heroic little brush truck succeeded in sucking up the bulk of it, they couldn't
*  clean everything.
*  They compressed the remnants into the channels between the cobblestones and left a colorless
*  scum coating the surface of the town.
*  It was super slick.
*  Many people, delicate looking older people, mothers with infants strapped to their chests,
*  tread carefully without complaint.
*  Others took running starts, turned sideways, and enjoyed the ride.
*  During the final moments of the battle one afternoon, I watched a middle-aged man cross
*  a corner of the town's largest piyata holding a glass of red wine, an actual glass.
*  He'd just taken a sip when suddenly his feet skidded outward and he crashed on his side.
*  He landed facing the wrong direction.
*  He did not see the carriage turn the corner and bear down right behind him.
*  A younger man from the R&C team death, his black uniform drenched his head topped with
*  a tangle of brightly dyed hair, dashed off the sidewalk, grabbed the fallen man by the
*  arm and dragged him out of the way of the horses at the very last second.
*  The man glided frictionlessly, hydroplaning like an air hockey puck.
*  Finally rising to his feet, he examined his glass and found it mostly full.
*  He'd managed to hold it aloft the entire time.
*  They were hardly any streaks of the sides.
*  But why?
*  Why oranges?
*  Why throw oranges?
*  Why?
*  Eight centuries ago, more or less, present day Iverea was ruled by a despot, the Marquis
*  Ranieri di Piendrata.
*  The Marquis was despicable, stingy, cruel.
*  He customarily abducted peasant women on their wedding nights and raped them.
*  In the night, however, according to a mishmash of history and legend, the miller's daughter
*  named Violetta managed to fight him off.
*  Before long she appeared in the window of the tyrant's castle by firelight, holding his
*  decapitated head in one hand.
*  A revolt ignited instantly.
*  Violetta's defiance incited the populace to burn the palace to the ground, freeing themselves
*  to do whatever they pleased.
*  And what pleased them apparently was to hurl oranges at one another annually for three
*  days' strength.
*  Sort of.
*  I'm skipping over 30 odd generations of local history in which the tradition complexified
*  and evolved before assuming its current form in the years after World War II.
*  Initially, in the Middle Ages, the people of the Iverea threw beans at one another.
*  It wasn't until the mid-1800s that they first weaponized oranges, assimilating another
*  local tradition, wearing girls on balconies tossed oranges at boys they liked.
*  But whatever the food stuff, the idea has always been to simultaneously commemorate Iverea's
*  rebellion and celebrate the freedom it brought.
*  The burly warriors on the carriages are standings for the Marquis feudal army, while the
*  Arn cherry on foot, who route them out of the piazzas again and again, represent the
*  rampaging populace.
*  At some point, the tradition was also fused to the traditional celebration of carnival,
*  which allows for similarly unrestrained rockiness and heavy drinking in the days leading up to
*  lent.
*  So to sum up, its live action role playing, its historical reenactment, its mari-gra held
*  at Colonial Williamsburg with head wounds and fruit.
*  In fact, the orange throwing is only the most attention-grabbing ritual in a sprawl
*  of ancillary carnival traditions in Iverea.
*  The whole program begins many weeks earlier, with a ceremonial parade in early January,
*  then proceeds through one fiscidiously prescribed right after another, such as a gathering of
*  ten children convened on the Saturday before the third to last Sunday before carnival.
*  I struggled to follow the dungeons and dragons like complexity of it all, even the stuff
*  happening while I was in town, the eleven separate bean feasts, a ceremony in which a
*  recently married couple in Iverea's neighborhood digs a hole.
*  The thirty foot poles covered in dried heather and juniper that are placed at the center
*  of certain piazzas and ignited into frightening pillars of flame.
*  You don't explain carnival, one woman told me, you live it.
*  I just knew every morning to put on my barretto of Fregio, long red stocking cap that spectators
*  must wear at all times during carnival while within Iverea's city hall.
*  The barretto of Fregio identifies you as a supporter of self-determination and freedom.
*  Walk around without a barretto of Fregio and the orange charity may attack.
*  You will be targeted, I heard one of carnivals organizers warn a reporter who derived an
*  stylish red headband instead of the hat.
*  Starting over all of this is a codery of characters plucked haphazardly from other periods
*  in Iverea's history, creating around and antiquarian costumes.
*  Each year, different high status local people are given the honor of playing a particular
*  role.
*  These include the general, who is granted symbolic control over the city for the duration
*  of carnival by Iverea's actual mayor, and the assistant grand chancellor who records
*  the successful completion of each personicity tradition in a large, fancy book.
*  These dignitaries also help fund the festivities in exchange for their appointments, with some
*  of them cutting checks for as much as 30,000 euros.
*  The unquestioned star of Carnival, however, is the Vizzosa Muniaia, or Charming Miller's
*  daughter, an embodiment of Violeta who sparked the original revolt.
*  The Muniaia spends much of Carnival crisscrossing the city in a golden chariot, wearing a white
*  gown and green sash, heaving armfuls of candy and flowers overboard to the crowds.
*  Everywhere she goes, the fighting stops, and hundreds of people shriek vivala Muniaia
*  and basically lose their minds.
*  The identity of each year's Muniaia is kept secret until the night before the first
*  orange battle.
*  Shortly after arriving in town, I watched from Iverea's packed central piazza as a congress
*  of men in brass studded coats and white wigs introduced her from the balcony of the city hall.
*  They shouted the name Elena Bergamini in Bartos, and a dark-haired woman appeared in an adjacent
*  window, waving both arms feverishly back and forth.
*  As a greeting, it had a bizarre intensity.
*  She looked as if she were trying to stop an airplane, taxing recklessly toward the wrong
*  gate.
*  The crowd turned rapturous.
*  Her name would not have been familiar to most of those cheering in the piazza.
*  Bergamini and Bartos is a former concert clarinetist and mother of two who works for a nearby
*  municipality.
*  But she was their Muniaia now, and that was enough.
*  Eventually, the Muniaia climbed into her chariot and exited the square.
*  Everyone filed out behind her.
*  Suddenly, a parade.
*  There were drummers and five players screeching away on their wooden flutes, and the general,
*  in his military regalia, his hand held in a firm salute, as though he were an oil painting
*  of himself.
*  There were brigades of soldiers with muskets and spears.
*  They are in cherry teams dancing and chanting beneath their towering flags, and waves of
*  ordinary, elated, evrans, and outsiders, including somewhere in the barely moving logjam
*  of bodies toward the back, me.
*  The pace of the procession was collacial.
*  The claustrophobia was intense, but I was the only one who seemed to put out.
*  I'd struggle to exit the parade and go around it, only to get stuck in the parade again.
*  This became a theme.
*  Parades of various sizes and complexities snaked everywhere through Eivreia's streets during
*  carnival, and as I hustled to catch the end of some ceremony, or keep various appointments
*  in town, I'd be blocked or absorbed by them again and again.
*  Parades crossed my path perpendicularly.
*  They clogged the road ahead.
*  Once I was trapped behind a parade, only to have it suddenly turn around and come straight
*  at me.
*  It was not a thing to keep happening to a person during a celebration of freedom, but I
*  simply could not outfox the parades.
*  They seemed to get bigger, longer, and slower whenever I tried.
*  Other time, swear, a parade appeared to magically regenerate and pass in front of me twice,
*  as though the parade were a mobius strip.
*  One night I was having a pleasant conversation in the lobby of City Hall and didn't notice
*  the uniformed brass players and soldiers amassing on the front staircase behind me, forming
*  a parade, trapping me inside.
*  Soon a tense up at the sound of distant fiefs felt preposterous, like a metaphor, like
*  a Kafka story, a lowly office clerk in a European city who every time he leaves his apartment
*  is encircled and thwarted by ceremonial parades.
*  Except this couldn't have been clearer.
*  I wasn't the protagonist.
*  I was nothing.
*  My autonomy and desires were subsumed by a tradition that belonged to and was beloved
*  by everyone else.
*  Every morning during the battle of the oranges, new black eyes bloomed all over town.
*  Under other eyes, huge, imperpled cushions of flesh rose up.
*  Still others were bloody, or they should have been white.
*  These were signs of valor in Eurea.
*  According to several team leaders I spoke to, people wanted to get bruised.
*  In fact, you'd periodically spot some gung-ho aren't cherries standing stock still behind
*  a carriage with his face raised toward the throwers to invite a direct hit, like a man
*  had been confined indoors for years, hypnotized by the heat of the sun.
*  And among the many patches I'd spot sewn onto people's jerseys was one with the same figure
*  used to indicate genders on bathroom doors, raising an arm to shield its face.
*  A thick red line ran through the illustration.
*  It wasn't allowed.
*  By the time the last orange was thrown, 469 people would seek medical attention from the
*  onsite paramedics.
*  Though looking around, you got the sense that these weren't necessarily the most severely
*  injured people, just the complainers.
*  And yet what I almost never saw during the battle of the oranges was any public expression
*  of pain, only once a young boy running into his mother's arms wailing after being
*  tagged in the eye.
*  Consider not only the pain of the impact but the sting of the juice.
*  My theory was that jubilation was a powerful analgesic.
*  Everyone's pain receptors were short-circuited by delight.
*  Even among those at the edges of the battle, even among the spectators, there was a dispassionate
*  acceptance of the pandemonium that felt unreal.
*  There was the young woman struck suddenly by citrusy shrapnel, casually wiping down her
*  cheek in the middle of a conversation.
*  The man and woman snuggling tenderly with their backs turned to a carriage, her head taking
*  shelter in the crook of his neck.
*  The parents without fear for their children, the children without fear for themselves.
*  Four days in Eurea hadn't desensitized me to the unusualness of any of it.
*  For me it was unrelatable, alienating at times.
*  Even many Italians outside Eurea find the battle of the oranges embarrassing or unscivilized.
*  Every year criticisms arise.
*  There's concern for the welfare of the horses pulling the carriages, disgust with all the
*  wasted food.
*  I'd read about steps taken to address these issues.
*  There's now a program to turn the spent oranges into compost and biofuel, for example.
*  But the historic carnival of Yvrea Foundation did not brag about these advancements, the
*  way an American festival would.
*  At one point, Stefano Amplini, who runs public relations with the foundation, has been
*  a fanatical iron cherry himself since boyhood told me.
*  What we say in Yvrea is that the only orange that's wasted is the one we don't throw.
*  And when I mentioned to him that I'd seen that one boy get hit in the eye and start crying,
*  Amplini said, yes, and moved on.
*  Taurus kept arriving, still mostly other Italians, relatively few it seemed from abroad, and
*  they definitely weren't unwelcome.
*  But there was little signage or material around to orient them and shockingly few souvenirs
*  for them to buy.
*  Given the perilous environment, given how much locals needed those four days to provide
*  an all-consuming torrent of pleasure, seemed like anyone else was kind of in the way.
*  Entertaining outsiders was the point, nor was appeasing critics, or massaging the optics
*  of young men hurting one another in the year 2023.
*  It seemed to me that the point of the carnival was exquisitely simple.
*  It was a game Yvren's loved playing together for its own sake, and primarily among themselves.
*  This hit me most powerfully while stuck in one last parade.
*  It was the final procession of the festival, a somber late-night funeral march through
*  the medieval city to mourn carnivals end.
*  I genuinely thought I'd outsmarted this parade and beat it to its destination, but
*  before I knew what was happening, I was hurried onto the side of the street with a crush
*  of other parade watchers, a blob of puffy jackets, some of them blotched with dried pulp.
*  The mood was solemn, the aesthetic was spare.
*  There were no horses this time, no brass bands or drums, just the sad, out of tune quavering
*  of a few wooden flutes while the general and his entourage approached on foot.
*  The crowd did not make a sound.
*  Their reverence seemed total.
*  When a phone rang, it was stifled.
*  When a long, rubbery fart sounded in the stillness, not a single person laughed.
*  Fragial equilibrium was being maintained between the seriousness and un-seriousness of carnival,
*  between how crazy the thing looked and how meaningful it felt.
*  I loved the battle of oranges for pulling that off.
*  It was the ugliest beautiful thing I ever saw.
