# Nikki Haleyâ€™s Moment
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8cmFxJOvVY)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  In the Republican presidential primary, Nikki Haley is having a moment.
*  The question is, what does it mean, and where can it go?
*  I spoke with my colleagues, Jasmine Ayoa and Nate Cohn.
*  It's Thursday, December 7th.
*  Thank you so much.
*  It's great to be here in Johnson County and great to be here in Iowa City.
*  Jasmine, you have been covering the Nikki Haley campaign over the past many months.
*  Every speech, every event.
*  And I wonder if you can help us understand what her candidacy was like when you first arrived on this beat.
*  So I first started trailing her in the summer.
*  So I see some new faces and we appreciate that.
*  So we're going to start off by telling you a little bit about me.
*  And her crowds were modest.
*  You know, I wouldn't say there were empty chairs everywhere, but they were definitely small.
*  I'd look around in the press pin and there weren't that many reporters there yet.
*  So what I will tell you is if you've liked what I had to say today, go tell 10 people.
*  And the attitude from voters was excitement to see a conservative woman on this national stage.
*  Plenty of people knew her as governor of South Carolina or even more as a United Nations ambassador under Donald Trump.
*  Hi, how are you? Good to see you.
*  Hi, nice to meet you.
*  Nice to see you. How are you?
*  We're so glad you're here. Thanks for taking the time.
*  But there didn't really seem to be a clear case for why she was running.
*  The attitude in the crowd was still very much like, why is she doing this?
*  You know, I remember being in the audience and a voter very early on asking,
*  is this going to be a repeat of 2016 where the field is just going to be fractured and it's going to give Trump a chance to rise?
*  And don't you think people should drop out?
*  And the implication in the question was, don't you think you should drop out?
*  What you're describing and what this voter is really saying is that Nikki Haley at this point is kind of being written off.
*  Right. She was single digits in the polls.
*  She was low on fundraising.
*  And that was especially putting her at a disadvantage in a place like Iowa,
*  where it takes a lot of time and resources to really cover ground in the state.
*  And when did you start to notice all of that beginning to change?
*  Tonight, the race for the White House takes flight.
*  Welcome to the first...
*  I think the first inflection point for her campaign really was the first debate.
*  This is exactly why Margaret Thatcher said, if you want something said, ask a man.
*  If you want something done, ask a woman.
*  That's when she really stood out from the pack.
*  You have Ron DeSantis, you've got Tim Scott, you've got Mike Pence.
*  They all voted to raise the debt.
*  And at the next debate, she did even better.
*  Honestly, every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.
*  She projected strength and confidence and experience.
*  There you have it.
*  Under your watch, you make America less so.
*  You have no foreign policy experience.
*  And it shows.
*  And you know what?
*  There's the foreign policy experience that you have.
*  And slowly and steadily, I started seeing more people at her events.
*  The makeup of the crowds was different.
*  She was reaching more independents, moderates.
*  Interesting.
*  Hi.
*  My name is Jasmine.
*  You are the reporter?
*  Have you been here in time?
*  Any time?
*  I was just in New Hampshire last week and I talked to voters.
*  Are you seriously considering Nikki Haley?
*  Yes, I am.
*  Yep.
*  What about her?
*  When did you start considering her?
*  When did you come into your radar?
*  Well, we watched the debates and everything and...
*  And what I was hearing from people was that they really liked what she had to say at the
*  debates.
*  How many debates have there been?
*  Two or three?
*  Three of them, right?
*  Yeah.
*  We watched all three.
*  She just, she shines.
*  She has great presence.
*  I've been impressed with how she handles herself.
*  And I think for the most part, she tells the truth.
*  You know, she talks about the deficit.
*  She's so pragmatic as far as abortion goes.
*  They were really attracted to the way she talks about issues, especially abortion.
*  I just think she sees the big picture.
*  And a lot of people in politics want to be either far left or far right.
*  And you can't, I don't think you can be that.
*  You've got to be somewhere in the middle.
*  And I think she's more in the middle.
*  I obviously wouldn't vote for Trump.
*  So it's down to a few people that sound a little bit more reasonable.
*  Do you think that she can beat the former president in the primary?
*  I don't know, but I'm wishing her the best of luck.
*  And how does this growing energy end up being reflected in those polls, which you said had
*  been in just the single digits back in the summer?
*  So she's really surged in the early states.
*  You know, after being less than 10% in these early states, she is now at 20%.
*  Nearly 20% in New Hampshire and South Carolina, where she is in solidly second place.
*  And in Iowa, she's climbing.
*  She's reached Rhonda Santis.
*  She's tied in some polls about 16% in the last poll in October.
*  And that steady climb in the polls, the breakout performances, and then the fact that you had
*  former Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Tim Scott, who was a fellow South Carolinian,
*  dropped their bids this fall.
*  All of these things have kind of led up to her seeing not only a rise in enthusiasm on
*  the trail, but this rise in donations.
*  And she's really caught the attention of more affluent donors.
*  More, you know, Wall Street executives have really warmed up to her.
*  And on top of all of that, she has attracted the attention of one of the most influential
*  Republican donors, billionaire David Koch, whose network Americans for Prosperity Action,
*  just last week, endorsed her.
*  And this is one of the largest grassroots organizations out there.
*  And they basically came out backing her saying that she was the most electable candidate.
*  And not only that, saying that she's a tested leader with the right judgment and the policy
*  background, to really turn the page on the divisive politics of the moment.
*  And that endorsement means that all that organization's money, all of its political muscle is suddenly
*  behind Nikki Haley.
*  And it really seems to cap this pretty remarkable transformation from a candidate who can't
*  really fill a room, isn't covered by a lot of national reporters, and is in the single
*  digits, to what Nikki Haley is now at the close of 2023, which is a candidate who looks
*  like pretty much the number two in this race across many of these early voting states.
*  Right.
*  And within a week of that endorsement, the organization had already poured $3.5 million
*  into hiring door knockers and placing digital ads.
*  So that really is going to change the game for her on the mobilization front, because
*  this is a candidate who now has hundreds of volunteers in each of these early states.
*  And so it's been quite a few months for her, and it's been pretty remarkable to watch
*  her climb from such a low position in the race to this strong challenger representative
*  who wants something other than Trump.
*  So Nate, as Jasmine just explained, Nikki Haley's success over the past few months
*  is both undeniable and mathematically quite impressive.
*  And now we want to turn to you to put it into context.
*  So help us understand what Haley's surge means and doesn't mean in a race that is
*  so thoroughly dominated by Donald Trump.
*  I think that what Nikki Haley is doing is she has positioned herself as the best candidate
*  for voters who do not want Donald Trump to be the Republican nominee for president.
*  And Donald Trump is the clear front runner in this race.
*  A majority of Republicans want him to be the nominee, but many do not.
*  And what Nikki Haley is doing is something that's actually really common in presidential
*  committees.
*  And if I could use a fancy term for it, that term would be to call her a factional candidate.
*  That's a candidate that appeals squarely to the wants and needs of a faction of a political
*  party that is dissatisfied with the front runner of their own party.
*  And if you think about it, even the strongest front runners, a George W. Bush in 2000, a
*  Ronald Reagan, a Hillary Clinton, don't perfectly appeal to everybody.
*  And as a result, there is almost always an opening for the candidate that appeals most
*  directly to that disaffected faction of a party.
*  And in this election, that's Nikki Haley.
*  Okay, well, remind us of some of the historical factional candidates, because I think that
*  might be illuminating.
*  Bernie Sanders appealing to the Democratic Socialist left against a establishment moderate
*  like Hillary Clinton.
*  Rick Santorum appealing to the religious right against establishment Mormon from the Northeast
*  like Mitt Romney.
*  John Kasich in 2016, the establishment moderate in that election against Donald Trump and
*  Ted Cruz.
*  Howard Dean, Ron Paul, Jesse Jackson.
*  We could do this for almost every election, that there is a candidate who speaks to the
*  needs of a part of the party that isn't satisfied by the front runner and in some cases is outright
*  opposed to the front runner.
*  Right.
*  So a way to think about factional candidates as a result might be to see them as repositories
*  for voters disillusioned with their party's front runner.
*  That's half of it, but it's worth remembering that they usually have organic and authentic
*  appeal to these same voters too.
*  You know, Jesse Jackson is not just a candidate who is there for black voters who don't like
*  Michael Dukakis.
*  He had a real connection with left leaning voters and African Americans in the 1984
*  Democratic primary.
*  He had real appeal to evangelicals.
*  He's not some faker.
*  Bernie Sanders has real appeal to democratic socialists.
*  He's a true believer and they usually have both of those traits.
*  Okay.
*  So how has Nikki Haley become the factional candidate success story in this Republican
*  primary in such a crowded field where we anticipated that so many other Republicans might fill
*  that role and where she herself is a somewhat complicated figure, right?
*  She's a former high ranking member of the Trump administration.
*  I think you're right that she's a complicated figure, but I think that if you step back
*  and look at her whole career, that she really does embody a more traditional kind of conservatism
*  that's really at odds with the Trumpist brand of Republican politics that we've seen over
*  the last few years.
*  This is someone who when she ran and was elected as governor of South Carolina in 2010, she
*  did support many conservative policies, but she also ran as the child of Indian American
*  immigrants and her defining moment as governor was ultimately deciding to support bringing
*  down the Confederate flag from the state capital in South Carolina after there was a mass shooting
*  at a black church there.
*  It's worth remembering that she vigorously endorsed Marco Rubio in the Republican primary
*  in 2016 and that even once she joined the Trump administration as UN ambassador, she
*  was not exactly parroting the MAGA talking points about foreign policy.
*  If you think about the things that anti-Trump Republicans are looking for in terms of temperament,
*  in terms of views on the issues and particularly on the issues that define Donald Trump like
*  his views on immigration, his populist economics and his foreign policy, Nikki Haley is exactly
*  the kind of candidate they would be looking for.
*  Right.
*  You're saying she's been able to carve out a political identity separate from Donald
*  Trump even though she served in his administration.
*  I want to zero in on an example of that, how she has managed to seize on issues in a way
*  that distinguish her from Trump in this current Republican primary campaign.
*  I think the easiest example is the way that she has talked about foreign policy in these
*  debates.
*  First of all, the American president needs to have moral clarity.
*  They need to know the difference between right and wrong.
*  And in particular, in these high profile clashes with Vivek Ramaswami.
*  And the problem that Vivek doesn't understand is he wants to hand Ukraine to Russia.
*  He wants to let China eat Taiwan.
*  Who has been acting as sort of the MAGA candidate on stage without Donald Trump there.
*  You don't do that to friends.
*  What you do instead is you have the backs of your friends.
*  She has blasted Ramaswami for being naive and not seeing the connections between Russia
*  and China and Iran for his willingness to potentially reduce aid to Israel.
*  A win for Russia is a win for China.
*  We have to know that Ukraine is the first line of defense for us.
*  And she has very vigorously defended all of the tenets of a neoconservative Reaganite
*  foreign policy.
*  Look at what Putin did today.
*  He killed Pergoson.
*  This guy is a murderer and you are choosing a murder or a pro-American country.
*  She's made this a defining issue for her in the campaign.
*  And this is an issue that a lot of people who dislike Trump really, really care about.
*  I just wanted to find a word that you have been using a little bit here, which is neoconservative.
*  And correct me if I'm wrong.
*  What you mean here is a foreign policy approach that harkens back to an older pre-Trump Republican
*  tradition of being interventionist, seeing America's role as robust, elbows out, who
*  needs us, where do they need us.
*  That's the opposite of Trump's more isolationist America first approach to foreign policy.
*  That's what you mean.
*  Exactly, Michael.
*  And the key is that she is holding the flag that these neoconservative Republicans who
*  have a long tradition in the Republican Party want to see pick up and held on a debate stage.
*  What about domestic issues?
*  How has she distinguished herself from Trump and fueled herself as the factional candidate?
*  So I think perhaps surprisingly abortion is the best answer to that question.
*  Thank you, Martha.
*  I am unapologetically pro-life, not because the Republican Party tells me to be.
*  She's pro-life and she passed abortion restrictions as governor of South Carolina.
*  She's been very skeptical about a federal abortion ban.
*  When it comes to a federal ban, let's be honest with the American people and say it will take
*  60 Senate votes.
*  It will take a majority of the House.
*  So in order to do that, let's find consensus.
*  And she's argued instead looking for consensus on the national stage on the issue.
*  She's taking a respectful and conciliatory tone toward voters who are pro-choice.
*  And can't we all agree that we are not going to put a woman in jail or give her the death
*  penalty if she gets an abortion?
*  Let's treat this like a respectful issue that it is and humanize the situation and stop
*  demonizing the situation.
*  And I think that contrasts with the rest of the Republican field in a lot of important
*  ways that appeal to voters who don't support Donald Trump.
*  A lot of people who are skeptical of Trump are relatively moderate, including on abortion.
*  And there are a lot of pro-choice Republicans out there.
*  But it's not just about the issues.
*  It's also about the tone.
*  This kind of establishment friendly, compromising, moderate and conciliatory candidate is the
*  sort of thing that a lot of voters want and are looking for.
*  And they may not be a majority of Republicans.
*  But if you're the sort of person who doesn't like Donald Trump because of his conduct,
*  this is exactly the breath of fresh air that you're looking for from a Republican presidential
*  candidate.
*  But the conundrum for Nikki Haley and really every effective factional candidate is the
*  same things that make her appealing to independent moderate voters, make her a really imperfect
*  the rest of a very conservative Republican party and make it very challenging for her
*  to actually beat Donald Trump.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Nate, walk us through why Nikki Haley's success at being a factional candidate so
*  far means that it's going to be so hard for her to seriously challenge Trump, because
*  I have to say your description of what she has been up to so far seems like a plan to
*  try to mop up every Republican voter who dislikes Trump, of which there are very many within
*  the Republican Party.
*  There are a lot of them, but there aren't nearly enough of them to power a winning Republican
*  presidential campaign, Michael.
*  I mean, if we just step back and look at the math here for a second, there are three big
*  blocks of Republican voters.
*  One group, let's call it 40% of the Republican electorate, is the Trump-MACA base.
*  They've supported him at every point.
*  They support him today.
*  Then there's another 20% or so of Republicans that doesn't like Trump, disagrees, though,
*  on the issues strongly or disagrees with his personal character and conduct strongly.
*  A lot of these people will consider voting for Joe Biden in the general election.
*  And Nikki Haley has a very good pitch for that 20%.
*  Then there's another 40% of Republican voters who like Trump but are open to voting for
*  someone else.
*  Some of them like him a lot on the issues and don't like his personality as much.
*  Some of them may like his personality but disagree with him on a few issues.
*  It's tempting to look at that 40% and say that those are voters that Nikki Haley can
*  win over, but they're much more conservative than the kind of independent, moderate, Biden-curious
*  Republicans or independents that Nikki Haley is often winning right now.
*  The more that Nikki Haley does to secure her base of support among the people who don't
*  like Donald Trump very much, the more she could repel the persuadable voters who do
*  like Donald Trump and who support him on all kinds of issues.
*  You're saying as Nikki Haley becomes known for becoming a Trump alternative and that
*  message gets out more and more and she finds more and more ways to reinforce it, she's
*  going to be contrasting herself more sharply with Trump and therefore crystallizing for
*  many Republican primary voters why they like Trump and why they don't like her.
*  In other words, the more she will push away that 40% who are a little wishy-washy on Trump
*  and clarify for them why they might actually really like him.
*  Yeah, many of these 40% think the Republican party should oppose immigration reform.
*  Many of them oppose aid to Ukraine.
*  You know, so if Nikki Haley runs a campaign that's pro-immigration or pro-aid to Ukraine
*  and is relatively moderate, many of those voters who are open to voting against Trump
*  but like him are going to decide they'd rather have Donald Trump than Nikki Haley.
*  Okay, I want you to project this math and this understanding that you have been explaining
*  forward through the next couple of months in the primaries which will start in early
*  January and perhaps you can do that by calling back to a previous factional candidate who
*  looked a lot like Nikki Haley.
*  I have someone in mind and that is...
*  It is because I owe America more than she has ever owed me that I am a candidate for
*  president of the United States.
*  Who was the factional candidate vis-a-vis George W. Bush.
*  Exactly, and George W. Bush is really the only candidate in the history of modern political
*  polling whose position in the Republican primary looks a lot like Donald Trump's position today.
*  It's interesting to see the Bush campaign at this point.
*  He has the luxury because he has such a lead in the polls that he can spend his time looking
*  toward the general election and reaching...
*  Both Trump and Bush were pulling over 60% nationwide.
*  They had a lot of broad appeal in the Republican Party.
*  Bush wasn't running for a third Republican nomination but it would be the third Bush
*  Republican nomination.
*  Hmm.
*  It expresses a certain amount of confidence on Bush's part that he is known by the family
*  he keeps for one thing.
*  And John McCain at this time started out in the teens in New Hampshire.
*  He wasn't considered one of the strongest threats to George W. Bush nationwide either.
*  Governor George W. Bush, the governor of Texas and Senator John McCain,
*  the Republican Senator from Texas.
*  Arizona.
*  From Arizona.
*  Very nice.
*  I moved over.
*  One state over.
*  I don't think I'm allowed in Texas.
*  But like Nikki Haley, John McCain could squarely appeal to the kinds of voters who were dissatisfied
*  with George W. Bush.
*  And interestingly, they look a lot like the voters who are dissatisfied with Donald Trump.
*  Unless we get independence, reconstitute the old Reagan Democrats.
*  Who didn't like George W. Bush in 2000?
*  Relatively secular, northern, moderate, college-educated Republicans who just didn't
*  love a southern conservative evangelical Texan like George W. Bush.
*  Doesn't mean they hated George W. Bush, but he was never going to be a perfect fit for
*  an independent voter in New Hampshire, right?
*  But I'll tell you what, the Republican Party has lost its way.
*  And so what ended up happening?
*  Well, I mean, the most important thing that happened is that John McCain
*  just kept gaining and gaining in New Hampshire.
*  Thank you very much.
*  I think we finally have a poll without a margin of error.
*  And McCain didn't just win New Hampshire, he won it big.
*  And we have sent a powerful message to Washington that change is coming.
*  And it propelled him to a new level nationwide.
*  He cleared the field of serious competition.
*  The other candidates got out.
*  And John McCain ultimately won seven states in the election, even though a few months earlier,
*  he had been losing 65 to 10 in the polls nationwide.
*  Right. He caught fire.
*  He caught fire.
*  He won a bunch of states.
*  But he didn't come especially close to winning the nomination.
*  And in the end, John McCain ran into the same problem that every factional candidate does,
*  which is that a appeal that is targeted at a faction of a political party and
*  succeeds at consolidating it will often struggle to win over the majority of the party.
*  And he was unable to break that wall.
*  So if we extrapolate from that example, Nikki Haley, if she replicates John McCain's success,
*  which she is by no means a sure to do, but if she does, she might win New Hampshire.
*  She might quite logically win her home state of South Carolina.
*  This is her best case.
*  Yeah.
*  She could go on and win seven states.
*  And it would probably create a real impression of success and viability as a challenger to Trump.
*  I'm saying this because I'm a journalist and we can often lose our bearings.
*  But you're saying based on the math of being a factual candidate based on the model of John
*  McCain, it's very likely to then stall out.
*  Right.
*  I mean, remember what's going on here, Michael.
*  This is not a party of moderate establishment types anymore.
*  It's a very conservative and populist party.
*  And Nikki Haley is not a very conservative populist.
*  That fact is exactly what lets her win 20%.
*  And it's the same fact that means she will have a very hard time to be generous winning 50%.
*  Is there any scenario where Haley could somehow shock everyone and do more than win seven states,
*  but keep going and truly become somehow competitive with Trump?
*  Or is what you're saying, and maybe I'm just too dense, mathematically, Michael,
*  that's just not possible.
*  So just shut that down.
*  Well, let me just start with the historic answer, which is that these factional candidates
*  almost always lose.
*  And the only time when these factional candidates win, they almost show that they
*  weren't factional candidates.
*  Right?
*  So if Nikki Haley were to win the nomination with the campaign that she's run to this point,
*  it would be tantamount to demonstrating that she's not a mere faction, that the things that
*  she believes and that she represents are actually much more broadly appealing in the
*  Republican Party than I'm giving credit for today.
*  It would be an indication that much of what I've told you is wrong, not that she somehow
*  overcame it.
*  And if that happens, then we can have this conversation.
*  I've been wrong before, and for instance, based on polling have been wrong before, of course.
*  But historically speaking, for a candidate like Nikki Haley to win, it would be a sign
*  that we're just wrong about the breadth of her appeal and of her faction today.
*  That said, in this particular election, there is this big asterisk about Donald Trump's
*  legal challenges.
*  I think that we do have to continue to offer that caveat.
*  As the campaign gets underway, those challenges will become more real as he actually gets
*  into a criminal trial.
*  I think we have to at least allow the possibility, however small, that this will change the
*  race even though it has not to this point.
*  But other than that, there's not really much of a reason to think that a moderate establishment
*  type figure in today's Republican Party is well positioned to win the Republican primary
*  electorate.
*  It's just not what the Republican Party is.
*  And so in the end, the story of Nikki Haley's success, the story of this episode, is that
*  it's yet another way of understanding Trump's historic anomalous and near total dominance
*  of the Republican Party because the math of Haley's success at attracting the primary
*  voters who dislike Trump still ends with her very likely losing to him and losing really
*  soundly over the next couple of months.
*  Even right now, Nikki Haley is losing to Trump by like 50 points in the polls, Michael.
*  What she is doing to this point is impressive given where she started, but it leaves her
*  very, very, very far from seriously challenging Donald Trump.
*  Well, Nate, as always, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  Great to be with you.
*  Nikki is corrupt.
*  This is a woman who will send your kids to die so she can buy a bigger house.
*  On Wednesday night, the fourth Republican presidential debate seemed to confirm Nikki
*  Haley's place as the leading alternative to Donald Trump.
*  Throughout the night, rival candidates who are now trailing her in the polls, including
*  Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, repeatedly attacked her, a dynamic that Haley appeared
*  to relish.
*  I love all the attention, fellas.
*  Thank you for that.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Israel, which is under growing pressure to demonstrate that its operations in Gaza are
*  working, said it has killed at least five key Hamas military leaders and roughly half
*  of Hamas' battalion commanders.
*  Among the leaders who have been killed, according to Israel, were the head of Hamas' aerial
*  division.
*  In response, Hamas confirmed that several of its key leaders have been killed.
*  And on Wednesday, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted by fellow Republicans
*  in October, said he would resign from Congress at the end of the year, a full year before
*  his term is up.
*  That decision could further imperil Republicans' already slim majority in the House, which is
*  currently just three seats following the expulsion of Republican George Santos of New York.
